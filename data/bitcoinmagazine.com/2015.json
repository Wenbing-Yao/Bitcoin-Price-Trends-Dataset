Enigma will enable untrusted and anonymous participants to securely share sensitive information with a third party.\n\n\nThe name \u201cEnigma\u201d is part of the history of cryptography and code-breaking. It was the name of the electro-mechanical encryption system\nused by Germany before and during World War II, which was broken by a group of notable mathematicians and early computer scientists, including Alan Turing.\u00a0\n\nEnigma was created by Oz Nathan, a technology entrepreneur formerly associated with the Counter Terror Unit of the Israeli Defense Forces, and Guy Zyskind, a graduate student and research assistant at the MIT Media Lab whose research interests lie at the intersection of data, privacy and Bitcoin. Zyskind\u2019s advisor, Prof. Alex \u201cSandy\u201d Pentland, is associated with the Enigma team.\n\nThe new Enigma is powered by the blockchain.\u00a0\n\n\nEnigma is a decentralized cloud platform with guaranteed privacy,\u201d states the Enigma\nwebsite. \u201cPrivate data is stored, shared and analyzed without ever being fully revealed to any party. Secure multi-party computation, empowered by the blockchain, is the magical technology behind it.\u201d\n\n\nIn fact, protecting sensitive data is but a part of what Enigma will do.\u00a0 An important and innovative feature of the system is that it will permit analyzing the data stored by the system with external applications while keeping the data itself private and under full control of its owners.\u00a0\n\nFurthermore, data owners will be able to monetize their data. For example, participants could anonymously sell partial, controlled access to their medical data to pharmaceutical companies that need to run data analysis programs on a wide sample of patients\u2019 data.\n\n\u201c[Enigma] is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, enabling different parties to jointly store and run computations on data while keeping the data completely private,\u201d states the Enigma whitepaper\n\u00a0 written by Nathan, Zyskind and Pentland. \u201cEnigma's computational model is based on a highly optimized version of secure multi-party computation, guaranteed by a verifiable secret-sharing scheme. For storage, Enigma uses a modified distributed hashtable for holding secret-shared data.\n\n\nAn external blockchain is utilized as the controller of the network, manages access control, identities and serves as a tamper-proof log of events. Security deposits and fees incentivize operation, correctness and fairness of the system,\" the whitepaper continues. \"Similar to Bitcoin, Enigma removes the need for a trusted third party, enabling autonomous control of personal data. For the first time, users are able to share their data with cryptographic guarantees regarding their privacy.\u201d\n\n\nThe Enigma creators won the final round of the Summer Startup Competition organized by the MIT Bitcoin Project in 2014. \u201cThe team winning the $5,000 grand prize, Ethos \u2013 comprised of MIT Media Lab grad students Amir Lazarovich & Guy Zyskind, along with Bitcoin entrepreneur Oz Nathan \u2013 had also won prizes in the two previous rounds,\u201d states the MIT Bitcoin Project\u2019s announcement. \u201cEthos wowed judges by submitting a working prototype of a decentralized network for storing and sharing personal data, delivering on the ambitious vision they laid out in the first two rounds.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Magazine\nreached out to the Enigma creators to find out more about Enigma\u2019s objectives and future plans.\n\n\nOne of our missions with Enigma is to minimize the tradeoff between security and privacy, by enabling people and organizations to share data with each other, while maintaining control over how the data is used, without ever revealing the raw data to anyone,\u201d Nathan told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\n\nSince July, the Enigma team\u2019s work has been focused on three things:\n\n\nThe implementation of Enigma;\n\nFormally proving the Enigma protocol in an academic paper, which should be published soon;\n\nTalking with potential users to understand what the most interesting use cases are.\n\n\n\u201cThe most interesting use case we're hearing from potential users is the ability to do data science and machine learning on encrypted data sets. Other use cases include private smart contracts and 'IoT with privacy',\u201d Zyskind told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nThe Enigma team will be launching a beta soon. Interested users can join the waiting list to participate in the beta by signing up for at the Enigma website.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 12, "day": 22}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nIf one proposal excited attendees at the recent \nScaling Bitcoin\n\n \nworkshop in Hong Kong, Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developer Dr. Pieter Wuille's Segregated Witness was it. Praised by many within the technical community, Segregated Witness is expected to improve Bitcoin's performance in a number of ways, while some even hope it might be the scaling solution that helps bring some peace back to the Bitcoin community.\n\nThe first\nand second\nparts of our three-part Segregated Witness series covered how it works and what it does. In this final part we explore what it means for the block-size dispute.\n\nWhat is the block-size dispute again?\n\nTo see what Segregated Witness means for the block-size dispute, let\u2019s first recap what the block-size dispute is. (Note that this is not an analysis of the arguments; just an explanation of them. If you\u2019re well aware of these arguments, feel free to skip to the next section.)\n\nIn essence, the block-size dispute represents a trade-off between throughput and decentralization \u2013 with a touch of economics involved. The current 1 megabyte block-size limit allows the Bitcoin network to process up to seven transactions per second. \u201cBlock-size Progressives\u201d consider this much too low; as on oft-cited comparison, Visa can process thousands of transactions per second. \n\nUndersized blocks, progressives fear, could limit Bitcoin\u2019s potential and increase the cost of transacting on the blockchain to the point where only centralized services will utilize it, or lead to users moving to alternative payments systems, or perhaps even cause a total failure of the system.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Bitcoin's \u201cDecentralists\u201d \nfear that increasing the block size too much could further centralize Bitcoin on a protocol level in several ways. For one, larger blocks take longer to propagate from one node to the next, and take longer for each individual node to verify, which further increases networkwide propagation time. This benefits miners (or pools) who find more blocks, as it means they get a head start mining on top of all blocks they find. Decentralists worry this would centralize mining into fewer pools.\n\nFurthermore, larger blocks would increase the cost of running a full node, as it would require more bandwidth, more processing power, and more disc space to do so. This complicates using Bitcoin in a trustless manner, where users verify all transactions against the consensus rules they signed up for. Instead, it incentivizes users to trust others to verify consensus rules for them; another centralizing force.\n\nMost Decentralists also believe some sort of block-size limit is required as an economical tool to create scarcity in blocks. This scarcity is needed, they think, to prevent a\n \ntragedy of the commons\n\n \ntype of situation, where miners end up in a downward spiral undercutting each other\u2019s fees to the point where transactions are almost free. If transactions are almost free, miners will be unable to earn enough to properly secure the network.\n\nSome Block-size Progressives believe fee pressure will establish naturally. Adding transactions increases the size of blocks, which would increase the orphan rate of outgoing blocks. This would make sure miners charge enough fees to make up for the added risk. Decentralists, however, argue this dynamic will simply result in another incentive to centralize mining, as that would prevent orphaned blocks altogether.\n\nAll of these centralizing forces, Decentralists say, could open the door to regulation of Bitcoin on a protocol level. Regulation on a protocol level, in turn, could harm Bitcoin\u2019s censorship resistance, and therefore Bitcoin\u2019s core value proposition.\n\nWhile Decentralists acknowledge that smaller blocks limit the number of transactions that can be processed on Bitcoin's blockchain, they typically envision a future where bitcoin \u2013 the currency \u2013 is transacted over added layers, such as the Lightning Network, treechains and more.\n\nBlock-size Progressives generally like these types of additional layers, too, but not as a solution for scalability. They typically believe Bitcoin should be designed to scale \u201con-chain\u201d first.\n\nWhat does Segregated Witness mean for Bitcoin\u2019s scalability?\n\n\nAs shown in the previous article, Segregated Witness affects Bitcoin's scalability in several ways. It solves transaction malleability, allowing added scaling layers to be rolled out faster and better. It enables Fraud Proofs, which improve SPV-node security to a certain extent. It allows discarding of old signature data, decreasing the cost of running a full node. It introduces version bytes, potentially making it easier to improve scalability in the future.\n\n\nAnd, of course, most directly related to the block-size limit, Segregated Witness could effectively increase Bitcoin's block size without increasing Bitcoin's block-size limit. To be precise, Wuille\u2019s proposal would allow for blocks up to some 2 megabytes of real transactions \u2013 or 4 megabytes if a miner fakes transactions designed to max out the potential.\n\n\nUnfortunately, this means that most improvements offered by Segregated Witness - while great - don't fundamentally solve the block size dispute. Fixing transaction malleability is fantastic, but Block Size Progressives don't accept the Lightning Network as a scalability solution. Fraud Proofs are useful, but SPV-nodes will still not be as secure as full nodes. Discarding old transaction data helps, but Bitcoin Core was rolling out similar solutions even before the introduction of Segregated Witness. And version bytes could come in very handy in the future, but these effects remain to be seen.\n\nSegregated Witness and the block-size limit\n\nThe question, therefore, is whether the effective block-size increase as offered by Wuille\u2019s Segregated Witness proposal satisfies both Decentralists and Block-size Progressives. Or - more specifically - whether 2 megabytes is large enough for Block-size Progressives, since Segregated Witness would allow up to 2 megabytes of real transaction data. And whether 4 megabytes is conservative enough for Decentralists, as large miners trying to outplay smaller competitors could produce 4-megabyte blocks.\n\n\nOne of the interesting things about Segregated Witness, is that it is an \u201copt-in\u201d solution. It\u2019s up to individual users to decide whether they want to upgrade their software to incorporate it. Users who want to use Segregated Witness can do so, and will get a \u201cdiscount\u201d on fees, as they\u2019re effectively using less of the scarce block space. And users who don\u2019t want to use Segregated Witness because of the increased cost of running a full node, don\u2019t have to. As such, at least one part of the Decentralist concern \u2013 the increased cost of running a full node \u2013 is solved.\n\n\nAnother part of the Decentralist concern \u2013 increased propagation time \u2013 is a bit more complicated. But Wuille \u2013 himself a Decentralist \u2013 does not think the increased block size will cause problems.\n\n\nBecause of how Segregated Witness nodes are verified, the added verification time for individual nodes is expected to be negligible. And while propagation time from node to node might increase a bit, Wuille\u2019s simulations suggest that the 4 megabyte maximum block size is within bounds of what the network can currently safely handle (but just barely).\n\n\nAs such, and because of the added advantages, most Decentralists support Segregated Witness as a vital part of a scalability \u201croad map,\u201d as set out by Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell. Similar to Core developer Jeff Garzik's BIP 102, Wuille's proposal could provide for a temporary bump to win time before blocks fill up (if Segregated Witness works and is used as intended) \u2013 but without breaking any of the existing consensus rules.\n\n\nDecentralists want to utilize this added time to work on long-term solutions, including a more durable block-size policy (perhaps flexcaps), additional scaling layers, and other optimizations.\n\n\nMost Block-size Progressives, however, don\u2019t consider an effective increase to 2 megabytes sufficient. For comparison, Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Core developer Gavin Andresen's proposed solution, BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) 101, starts with a block-limit increase to 8 megabytes, and is set to double every other year for 20 years until it reaches 8 gigabytes.\n\n\nAn earlier proposal by Andresen would have raised the maximum block size to 20 megabytes \u2013 which he already considered a compromise.\n\n\nMoreover, (pessimist) estimates by some Block-size Progressives predict it could take as much as a year before Segregated Witness can start to function as a relief valve for transaction data. Because of that, some developers erring to the side of Block-size Progressives, including Garzik, prefer a networkwide switch to increase the block-size limit, even before Segregated Witness is deployed.\n\n\nAnd that brings us to the main issue.\n\nOn hard forks and soft forks\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of Wuille\u2019s Segregated Witness proposal is that it can be rolled out without breaking any of the existing consensus rules. As such, the proposal can effectively be enforced by miners only. This is called a soft fork.\n\n\nA soft fork contrasts with a hard fork. A hard fork breaks the existing consensus rules, and requires all nodes on the network to implement the change. Every node that does not implement the change will be forked off the network. This could even result in two separate networks; two different types of Bitcoin. (If and how long such a situation would persist is up for debate.)\n\n\nIncreasing the block-size limit (the \u201cold-fashioned way\u201d) can be done only through a hard fork. As such, there must be consensus among all of Bitcoin\u2019s user-base that a block-size limit increase is the best way forward.\n\n\nAbsent consensus, a segment of Bitcoin\u2019s user base can attempt a hard fork, presumably hoping the rest of the user-base will implement the change after the fact. But if the rest of the user-base does not follow, the network will split. One such strategy was recently employed by R3CEV developer Mike Hearn and former Bitcoin Core lead developer Gavin Andresen through Bitcoin XT, but has not reached sufficient support so far.\n\n\nFurthermore, some developers \u2013 often (but not always) those in favor of increasing the block size limit through a hard fork \u2013 prefer to deploy Segregated Witness as hard fork as well. This has several advantages over a soft fork.\n\n\nFirst, a hard fork intends to make sure all nodes on the network adhere to the exact same rules. As such, full nodes verify whether all transactions are valid according to these rules, even transactions that do not involve their bitcoin.\n\n\nSecond, a hard fork would be a \u201ccleaner\u201d solution. While Wuille's Segregated Witness proposal, for instance, uses a clever trick to avoid breaking the existing consensus rules, it does so by utilizing parts of Bitcoin's protocol \u2013 the coinbase transaction's input \u2013 in ways it wasn't intended. Some fear that this added complexity could cause new problems in the future.\n\n\nAnd third, because of this clever but atypical workaround, writing Bitcoin compatible software (like wallets) can be a bit more complicated.\n\n\nOther developers \u2013 often (but not always) those who favor of a more conservative block-size approach \u2013 believe hard forks should only be deployed as the last available measure. The inherent risk of a hard fork, a split of the network, is something they want to avoid if at all possible. And if a hard fork must happen, for whatever reason, they maintain this should be announced and organized very far in advance to make sure every single user has had the chance to upgrade.\n\n\nA soft fork, on the other hand, can be rolled out as soon as the code is ready and vetted, and miners agree. The rest of Bitcoin\u2019s user base can upgrade if and when it pleases.\n\nSo where does that leave us?\n\nWhat it comes down to, in the end, is not whether a hard fork \u2013 either to increase Bitcoin\u2019s block size or to implement Segregated Witness \u2013 is objectively good or bad. Neither Bitcoin nor any of its developers can force Bitcoin\u2019s user base to adhere to new consensus rules that break the existing consensus rules \u2013 that\u2019s by design.\n\n\nThe real question, therefore, is whether a potential hard fork can reach consensus-support among Bitcoin\u2019s user base. And while \u201cconsensus\u201d is considered a vague requirement by some, few will maintain that a hard fork solution has reached consensus as of yet.\n\n\nThe most likely path forward for now, therefore, seems to be Maxwell\u2019s road map. That\u2019s the only path that does not require a hard fork any time soon, and it has been endorsed by a large segment of Bitcoin\u2019s development community. As such, it now really only requires support from a majority of hash power.\n\n\nBut another hard fork attempt \u2013 perhaps by prominent industry players \u2013 can\u2019t be ruled out. And, of course, Bitcoin XT is still out there as well.\n\n\nAt publication time of this article, the debate on Segregated Witness and scalability is not quite settled yet; for more discussion, see the Bitcoin development mailing list.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 12, "day": 29}

(tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\n\nIf one proposal excited attendees at the recent\n Scaling Bitcoin\n\nworkshop in Hong Kong, Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developer Dr. Pieter Wuille's\nSegregated Witness\nwas it. Praised by many within the technical community, Segregated Witness is expected to improve Bitcoin's performance in a number of ways, while some even hope it might be the scaling solution that helps bring some peace back to the Bitcoin community.\n\nThe first part\nof our three-part Segregated Witness series covered how it works. In this second part: What it does.\n\nIncreasing the Effective Block Size Without Increasing the Block-size Limit\n\nThe benefit of Wuille's Segregated Witness proposal that has perhaps drawn most attention, is that the removal of signatures from 1 megabyte blocks could effectively increase Bitcoin\u2019s block size. This means more transactions per second can be recorded on the blockchain, or in other words, it would allow for a higher transaction throughput. It could do so, moreover, without breaking any of the existing consensus rules - including the block size limit.\n\nWuille's proposal does introduce a new type of maximum block size. The formula used to calculate this limit is set somewhat arbitrarily: A block without\nthe Segregated Witnesses, plus a quarter\nof the Segregated Witnesses, must not exceed 1 megabyte. As such, all blocks will seem smaller than 1 megabyte to old nodes, since a quarter of the Segregated Witness (which they don't see) needs to fit in that same 1 megabyte. New nodes will meanwhile see blocks that exceed 1 megabyte, since the actual\nsize of the Segregated Witness is larger than the quarter accounted for.\n\nThe exact amount of additional space Segregated Witness opens up depends on the types of transactions new blocks include. If more transactions store more data in the Segregated Witness, as multisig transactions would do, the total size of new blocks increases. This adds up to a new maximum block size of about 1.75 megabyte for normal transactions, and 4 megabyte as a hard cap that\u2019s impossible to exceed even if (almost) all data is squized into the Segregated Witness.\n\nSay Goodbye to Transaction Malleability\n\nBut there's another, perhaps even greater advantage: Segregated Witness could take care of Bitcoin's  transaction malleability. In fact, this was the original motivation for Wuille and others to explore the Segregated Witness concept.\n\nTransaction malleability is caused by a cryptographic trick to change a signature, without changing what that signature stands for. This can be done, moreover, without the private key used to create the original signature. In Bitcoin's case, this means that anyone can pick any transaction from the peer-to-peer network, and alter the signature into an equally valid signature. This new signature still reflects the exact same data it originally signed, and it can still be verified using the same public key. It doesn't change what a transaction does at all. But because it looks different, it does completely change the transaction ID.\n\nTransaction malleability causes two main problems. First, it messes up the accounting of Bitcoin software that uses transaction IDs to verify whether transactions are confirmed. But perhaps more importantly, transaction malleability severely limits the potential of all sorts of advanced Bitcoin tricks that build on unconfirmed transactions (using their IDs), such as payments channels and the Lightning Network.\u00a0\n\nOf course, Segregated Witness pulls signatures out of the part of the transaction used to create the transaction ID. So while the signatures in the Segregated Witness could still be changed, this would not affect Bitcoin software using transaction IDs, nor would it matter for payments channels or the Lightning Network, thus setting the stage for the roll-out of additional scaling layers.\n\nScript Versions, or How Bitcoin Can Learn to do Almost Anything\n\nA third advantage of Wuille's Segregated Witness proposal has Bitcoin programmers just as excited as the first two \u2013 if not more-so: script versions.\n\nAs explained in the previous article, Segregated Witnesses carry scriptSigs that unlock bitcoin. But they carry something else, too: version bytes. These version bytes preface scriptSigs in Segregated Witnesses, indicating what kind of scriptSig it is. If a node reading the version byte recognizes the type, it can tell what requirements must be met to unlock bitcoin in the scriptSig. If a node reading the version byte does not\nrecognize the type, it interprets the scriptSig as an \u201cAnyone can spend.\u201d\n\nThis opens up all sorts of new ways to lock bitcoin up in transactions. In fact, it can be used to lock bitcoin up in any way developers come up with. As such, it's impossible to explain how this will be used in the future, since much of this still needs to be invented. But initial ideas include  Schnorr signatures, which are much faster to verify than signatures currently in use, and more complicated types of multisig transactions; perhaps even Ethereum-like scripts.\n\nAnd importantly: Like Segregated Witness itself, these types of upgrades will not break Bitcoin's existing consensus rules. Rather than every single Bitcoin node, only a majority of miners needs to adapt, making them much easier to deploy.\n\nFraud proofs: the Completion of Satoshi's Vision for SPV\n\nWe're not done yet. Segregated Witness could also introduce something called fraud proofs. Originally envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto, fraud proofs could significantly improve the security of SPV-nodes (or: \u201clight wallets\u201d); Bitcoin nodes that do not verify all transactions on the network or store the complete blockchain.\n\nTo check whether a transaction has taken place, SPV-nodes merely scan the blockchain for the relevant transaction ID. If they find it, that means a miner included the transaction in a block. But SPV-nodes do not validate whether the transaction adhered to Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules. As such, SPV-nodes trust miners to play fair, rather than verify they do. In a worst case scenario, this could even mean that miners pay SPV-nodes with bitcoin created out of nothing, for instance by creating transactions with no inputs, or by awarding themselves excess fees in the coinbase transaction.\n\nThese types of problems could be solved by requiring miners to include extra data in the Segregated Witness Merkle Tree, specifying where the bitcoin locked up in all transactions came from, exactly. That way, if a block contains invalid transactions, a short and easy-to-check fraud proof can be constructed by any full node. This full node can send the fraud proof to SPV-nodes, so they know to reject the block.\u00a0\n\nThat said, even with fraud proofs, SPV-nodes would not quite offer the same level of security as full nodes. Most importantly, the fraud proof solution requires that SPV-nodes can communicate with the network free from censorship. (For instance: censorship from government-sanctioned ISPs.) Additionally, SPV-nodes need at least one full node on the network to actually produce the fraud proofs.\n\nStorage\n\nFinally, Segregated Witness could decrease the amount of data Bitcoin nodes need to store on their hard drives. This, again, reduces the burden of running a full node, and brings down the time it takes to sync a node with the network when first installed.\n\nWhile full nodes typically store all transaction data for all of Bitcoin's history, signatures are reasonably considered expendable after a certain amount of time has passed. Once a transaction is considered valid, confirmed into a block, and secured in the blockchain with proof of work for \u2013 say \u2013 a year, it could only have been fraudulent if miners were collectively mining on an invalid chain for all that time, and presumably without anyone noticing.\n\nOf course, ridding the blockchain of older signatures is not a purist's ideal, as he might want to verify old transaction data regardless. Fortunately, that's not likely to become a problem either. All it requires is one such purist to seed the Segregated Witness data for everyone else to download.\n\nThe third part of this three-part story\u00a0will explore exactly what Segregated Witness means for the long-lasting block-size dispute.\u00a0\nThanks go out to \nBlockstream\n\n developers Pieter Wuille and Mark Friedenbach and \nCiphrex\n\n CEO Eric Lombrozo for provided information and added feedback \u2013 not to mention a lot of patience.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 12, "day": 22}

Many of these tensions about what Bitcoin is or should be have been aired and discussed during the blocksize debate and are ongoing.\u00a0\n\nOne essential element of a money which has not particularly been illustrated is how bitcoin might be affected by a significant gap in its \u201cfungibility.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201c[Fungibility] is the idea that a 10 dollar note is the same as any other 10 dollar note. So if you receive a note that was involved in a theft 10 transactions go and the police investigated the theft, then they would have no right to take the note away from you,\u201d according to Adam Back, the inventor of Hashcash.\n\n\nAccording to Back, this is an old legal concept, often traced to a 17th century court case in Scotland. In that case, a pair of high value notes marked with a unique signature were stolen and later on turned up at a bank. The owner took the case to court in an attempt to have the bank return the notes to him. The courts ruled that \u201cif notes could be returned to a previous owner after a theft, it could erode confidence in a currency,\u201d since your ownership would be at question and you would have to go and check the newspapers or try to make sure your money has not been claimed as stolen.\u00a0\n\nWhile the above briefly illuminates the history of fungibility as a key characteristic to money, it still leaves questions about\u00a0what might actually happen to a currency if such a crack in fungibility appeared. Kristov Atlas, a bitcoin privacy researcher raised some questions about the importance of fungibility in a recent post saying:\n\n\nThe needs for fungibility are somewhat unclear, in my opinion. Privacy advocates have been talking up fungibility for a while without providing a lot of evidence to back it. Perhaps this is why it has made such a dull impression on people.\n\n\nFungibility is a particular concern for bitcoin because bitcoin, unlike cash, sea shells or silver coins, has a cryptographically provable history of ownership. If the identity of a particular bitcoin\u2019s previous owners or the nature of the \u00a0transactions they engaged in was to be revealed and deemed illegal, could this cause \u00a0a future where new or unspent \u2018virgin\u2019 bitcoins are worth much more than old bitcoins orwhere coins associated with Silk Road transactions lose a great deal of their value? \u00a0\n\nSuch a scenario is not far-fetched. There are various blockchain analytics and compliance companies such as Coinalytics\n\nand Chainanalysis\n \u00a0which claim to be using artificial intelligence algorithms to group addresses and transactions and thus reveal \u2018entities\u2019 in the network. It\u2019s not hard to imagine that someday bitcoin payment processors could automatically compare incoming bitcoins to a \u201cdirty coin\u201d database, to determine their legality and or past connection with illegal trade.\u00a0\n\nTo learn more about these questions and concerns, Bitcoin Magazine \nspoke with J.P. Koning, an economics blogger\n\nwith a substantial body of work on the history of money.\u00a0\n\nBM:\nDo you know any examples in history where the fungibility of a currency broke? How did that play out?\n\nKoning:\nMany of the problems faced by those who managed medieval monetary system can be traced to deficits in fungibility.\n\nFor instance, England's silver pennies degraded steadily over time through regular wear and tear and also as they were clipp'd and sweated. When the mint issued new full bodied pennies, questions of fungibility emerged. A new penny, after all, had much more silver than a worn penny, and therefore had more intrinsic value. But each were pennies; they both had the same face value. So just as you get good and bad bitcoin, you had good and bad pennies.\n\nThe medieval economy dealt with the fungibility problem in a unique way. According to law and custom, merchants accepted all coins at face value. Put differently, they did not differentiate between old and new pennies. Shoppers thus had an incentive to pay with old and degraded pennies rather than use new full-bodied pennies. Why buy a fish with 24 grams of silver when you can pay with just 23 grams? Thus the bad money drove out the good from circulation; this is Gresham's famous law. For centuries, only the worst pennies circulated in England.\n\nIn the case of bitcoin, I'm not sure that law or custom would require merchants to accept all bitcoin at the same rate. If they were to differentiate between the two, you'd most likely get the opposite effect; good money would drive out the bad.\u201d\n\nBM:\nAre you worried about a \u00a0scenario where bitcoins with close association with a bitcoin address used on the Silk Road are flagged as being high risk for money laundering? What is the worse that could happen to bitcoin in the above scenario?\n\nKoning:\n\u00a0That reminds me of the recent euro crisis, where various types of euros threatened to become non-fungible with others. This summer, for instance, Greek euro deposits certainly lost their equivalence to non-Greek euros.\n\nKoning expanded on this thought in a related article,\u00a0where he wrote:\n\nOne of the deep problems facing the euro over the last three years was fear of euro break up. If Greece decided to leave the euro (or was kicked out), a Greek euro would no longer be equal to a German one. In the mind of the markets, euros had ceased to be homogeneous.\n\n\nIn anticipation of potential break up, a tremendous bank run began in which massive amounts of Italian, Greek, Irish, Spanish, and Portuguese euro deposits were converted into German and Dutch euro deposits. This all occurred on the books of the ECB's intra-eurosystem clearing mechanism\u2014Target2. While no limits had ever been placed on Target2 balances (or imbalances), fears that Germans might revolt and try to close the Target2 window led to ever faster withdrawals from the GIIPS.\n\n\nBM:\nBitcoin in some ways is very different than cash, particularly because the identification of each coin is tied to a historical public record of every transaction. I wonder if you know of any examples where such a financial asset suffered from a gap in fungibility. Like the stock of a company, or any other ownership token that would have a transparent history of ownership.\n\nKoning:\nBills of exchange and chopmarked\n\ncoins also had a paper trail. In the case of bills of exchange, the moment that the credit worthiness of a certain cosignatory to a bill of exchange was doubted, it would have started to trade at a much larger discount to par.\n\n\nAnalog versus Digital Money\n\n\nKoning\u2019s historical insights do paint a picture into how the market might evolve as money\u2019s fungibility changes, but bitcoin is unique and may evolve differently than any money before it.\u00a0\n\nMany of Koning\u2019s examples were related to a break in fungibility for political reasons, such as the euro crisis which saw runs on banks and demand for more trusted government versions of the euro versus the euros in Greek banks. However, Bitcoin\u2019s fungibility might be threatened by its use in dark markets.\u00a0\n\nIt is no secret that bitcoin has been widely used online to purchase goods on dark markets such as the Silk Road. A report\n\nby Kyle Soska and Nicolas Christin from Carnegie Mellon University claims that dark markets had a higher daily bitcoin trade volume than BitPay\u2019s reported $435,000 daily average, in 2014.\n\n\n\"In the short four years since the development of the original Silk Road, total volumes have reached up to $650,000 daily (averaged over 30-day windows) and are generally stable around $300,000\u2013$500,000 a day, far exceeding what had been previously reported,\" said the report.\n\nVirgin Coins and Bitcoin\u2019s Fungibility\n\n\nTo learn about the demand for newly mined, unspent \u201cvirgin\u201d Bitcoins, Bitcoin Magazine \nspoke with FinTech consultant Bilal Dar. According to Dar, he\u2019s seen \u201cvirgin\u201d bitcoin trading at a 20 percent to 30 percent premium to market prices.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe demand for virgin was nothing new ... Having virgin coins had many benefits. A full block of 25 coins mined between 2012 to 2016 would have collectible value. Similar is the value for 50 BTC block ... there are ways of deferring taxes if you have a coin with no or least amount of history. [Though some of this] would require private key swapping and a 'substantial' amount of trust between parties conducting transaction.\n\nSo did the value of Virgin coins have anything to do with the possibility of older coins being 'dirty'? No ... It was more of a possibility of 'perceived value' ... People had a lack of understanding, and in some case genuine use cases.\n\nToday he claims that the demand for virgin coins remains, but the supply has increased dramatically. \u201cYou can wait for 2 weeks and batches of freshly minted coin from China would be available,\u201d said Dar.\n\nThe Foreseeable Future\n\n\nThe impact of a \u00a0privacy leak or fungibility weakness in Bitcoin is yet to be discovered. After all, a cryptographically provable history of every transaction is an essential part Bitcoin and the blockchain. \u00a0The good news is that this topic is in the mind of many Bitcoin core developers and pioneers such as Adam Back, Gregory Maxwell and many others.\u00a0\n\nIn a 2014 presentation, Back explained the functionality of something called Blind RSA transactions dating back to the days of digicash, which according to him, are\n\n\u201ccryptographically unlinkable\"  and\n \"payer anonymous.\u201d Another promising discussion may be something called Confidential Transactions, being developed by several core developers at Blockstream.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd of course, many alternative cryptocurrencies have worked on the issue for years, including DASH, Monero, Cryptonote, and Zerocash. How Bitcoin will adapt to this market environment and whether it will evolve beyond this threat to its fungibility remains to be seen.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 12, "day": 22}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nIf one proposal excited attendees at the recent  Scaling Bitcoin\n\nworkshop in Hong Kong, Bitcoin Core and Blockstream, it was developer Dr. Pieter Wuille's Segregated Witness. Praised by many within the technical community, Segregated Witness is expected to improve Bitcoin's performance in a number of ways, while some even hope it might be the scaling solution that helps bring some peace back to the Bitcoin community.\n\nIn this first part of Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s three-part series on Segregated Witness: how it works.\n\nWhat are Bitcoin transactions again?\n\nIn order to understand Segregated Witness, it is helpful to understand what Bitcoin transactions are on a more technical level. (Feel free to skip to the last section of this article if this is a familiar subject.)\n\nFor starters, it's important to realize that the Bitcoin protocol, at its core, consists of transactions. Nodes on the peer-to-peer network don't send each other bitcoin; they send each other packages that contain transaction data.\n\nThese Bitcoin transactions, in a way, are really sets of \u201clocks.\u201d More specifically, each transaction contains two main components. One half effectively unlocks bitcoin that were locked up in previous transactions, using pieces of data called inputs. Inputs include scripts, instructions on how to unlock the input, called scriptSigs . The other half consists of one or several new locks called outputs, which lock the same amount or less bitcoin up again. Outputs include scripts called scriptPubKeys. As such, bitcoin effectively move from inputs to outputs within a single transaction, and jump from transaction to transaction at the same time.\n\nThere is one main exception to this rule. A coinbase transaction (not to be confused by the wallet company and exchange with the same name) is the transaction created by a miner when he finds a new block, and contains the block reward: currently 25 bitcoin. Additionally, a miner can increase the coinbase reward by any amount of bitcoin that was unlocked in transactions, but not locked up again: the difference between the inputs and the outputs. These are the transaction fees.\n\nAll of this \u201cunlocking\u201d and \u201clocking up\u201d of bitcoin is done by senders of transactions, and subsequently transmitted over the Bitcoin network as packages of information. All nodes on the network, then, check whether this process of unlocking and locking up was done correctly. If everything checks out, they forward the transaction to other nodes. And if a node is also a miner, it might include the transaction in a block. Whether he actually does so is up to the miner, however; that's why it makes sense to include a fee.\n\nIt is of vital importance that the rules used by all nodes to verify transactions are compatible with the rules used by (almost) all miners. If some miners would include transactions in blocks that other nodes reject, the whole block would be considered invalid by that node. If that node is also a miner, this could lead to double spends and network forks.\n\nThese consensus rules\n\u2013\n\u00a0the rules all nodes agree on\n\u2013\n\u00a0allow transactions to lock up (and unlock) bitcoin in several different ways at once. But outputs that lock up bitcoin typically, at least, include a scriptPubKey along the lines of: \u201cProve that you own (or: know) the private key\n\nthat corresponds to the public key that corresponds to this Bitcoin address.\u201d\n\n(It's easy to reproduce a public key\nfrom a private key, but it's basically impossible to reproduce a private key\nfrom a public key. Similarly, it's easy to reproduce a Bitcoin address\nfrom a public key, but it's impossible to reproduce a public key\nfrom a Bitcoin address. As such, it's also easy to reproduce a Bitcoin address\nfrom a private key, but impossible to reproduce a private key\nfrom a Bitcoin address. It's a \u201cone way street.\u201d)\n\nThe Bitcoin address used to lock bitcoin up in the scriptPubKey, of course, is the address provided by the receiving end of the transaction. Since the receiver created that address using a private key only he knows, he is the only one who can create a valid scriptSig, and therefore the only one who can create a new transaction and spend the locked up bitcoin.\n\nWhere do signatures come in?\n\nTo prove ownership of the private key that corresponds to the public key that corresponds to a Bitcoin address, one could theoretically include the private key in the scriptSig of a transaction. But, of course, that's not safe at all. Most importantly, anyone who sees the transaction could take the private key, and create a new transaction (or change the original transaction) to attribute himself as many bitcoin as are locked up before\nthe original transaction is included in a block. In fact, if a miner did this, it would become a piece of cake to steal bitcoin, since he's the one picking which transactions to confirm.\n\nInstead, therefore, the scriptPubKeys typically require the scriptSig to include one or more\nsignatures\nin order to unlock bitcoin.\n\nSignatures are a cryptographic trick which uses a private key\nin combination with any other data to calculate a unique string of numbers. And, using the magic of cryptography, the corresponding public key\ncan be used to verify that the signature was created using that private key. As such, signatures prove both ownership of a private key, as well as approval of a specific piece of data by the owner of that private key, all without actually needing to reveal the private key.\n\nIn Bitcoin's case, private keys are typically used to sign the transaction data minus the inputs. (Hence, the scriptPubKeys, the locked amounts, and some additional details.) Subsequently, this signature and the public key from which bitcoin are spent are added to the input field of the transaction. This proves that the owner of the private key really intended to create the transaction and makes sure it cannot be tampered with.\n\nThen, all of this transaction data \u2013 including the inputs this time \u2013 is hashed\n\ntogether, which creates the transaction ID, identifying the specific transaction. If a transaction is subsequently included in a block, the miner hashes the transaction ID together with another transaction ID to produce a new hash. And this hash is hashed again, this time along with the hash from two other transaction IDs. This process continues until there is only one hash left. This structure of hashes is called a Merkle Tree, and the remaining hash the Merkle Root . This Merkle Root is combined with additional block data to form the block header , which is used to identify the specific block. A hash of this block header, finally, must be included in the next block\u2019s header, chaining blocks together.\n\nBitcoin is considered immutable because changing any part of any transaction retroactively would alter the transaction ID, in turn altering the block header. But this altered block header would no longer meet the proof of work\n\nrequirement. And since the block header influences the make-up of subsequent block headers, neither would any of those.\n\nWhat is a Segregated Witness?\n\nThe Segregated Witness proposal as presented by Wuille in Hong Kong is based on a concept used in Blockstream's sidechain Elements, and a complementing idea by Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr. It was conceptualized over the past couple of months in cooperation with Bitcoin Core developers Gregory Maxwell and Eric Lombrozo, and might be rolled out over the next year.\n\nAs such, from the perspective of Bitcoin nodes that don't\nuse Segregated Witness (lets call them \u201cold nodes\u201d), some newly created outputs might soon use a strange type of scriptPubKeys. Strange, because these scriptPubKeys can hardly be considered a lock at all. Commonly referred to as an \u201cAnyone can spend,\u201d these scriptPubKeys basically proclaim they don't\nrequire a signature. Additionally, they will include some meaningless text.\n\nOld nodes will consider these transactions crazy. They will think that anyone can create a new scriptSig, unlocking these outputs, meaning they're highly insecure. But at the same time, old nodes won't mind either. After all, it's not their bitcoin that's being messed around with, and other people are free to do with their bitcoin as they please. The meaningless text will be considered weird, but fine too. So they'll confirm the transactions as valid, and forward it to other nodes.\n\nHowever, Segregated Witness-enabled nodes (lets call them \u201cnew nodes\u201d) will notice something else. They will see the otherwise meaningless text in the scriptPubKey, but not consider it meaningless at all. Instead, new nodes will recognize this piece of text as another \u2013 very special \u2013 type of output.\n\nMuch like typical outputs, this new type of output will require one or several signatures to unlock the bitcoin. But unlike typical outputs, this new type of output will not require the signature to be included in the scriptSig of a subsequent transaction. Instead, it will require the signature to be included in a completely new part of the transaction: the Segregated Witness.\n\nThis Segregated Witness is basically an \u201cadd-on\u201d that carries signatures and some additional data. Importantly, Segregated Witnesses are completely ignored by old nodes, but recognized by new nodes. Moreover, the data they carry is not hashed along with the other parts of a transaction into the transaction ID.\n\nAs such, both old nodes and new nodes will consider transactions containing signatures in the Segregated Witness valid. Old nodes validate them because from their perspective these transactions don't require a signature at all (and they don't see one), and new nodes validate them because the required signature is in the Segregated Witness. And since both old and new nodes hash the transaction data into the same transaction ID, everyone agrees on the makeup of blocks, and, as such, on the structure of the entire blockchain.\n\n(Note that it is\nimportant that all miners \u2013 or a very large majority \u2013 should use Segregated Witness in order to prevent double spends and chain forks, or none of them should. If all miners do use Segregated Witness, old nodes on the network might wonder why some transactions aren't included in blocks, but since it was always up to miners to decide which transactions to include, and since these are not their transactions, they won't mind, either.)\n\nBut there is one problem: If signatures have no effect on the makeup of the blockchain, the blockchain no longer serves as proof that the correct signatures were included in transactions.\n\nTo make sure that signatures are embedded in the blockchain regardless, a Segregated Witness-enabled miner adds a trick, too. Rather than creating only a Merkle Tree out of all of the transactions, it also creates a Merkle Tree out of all Segregated Witnesses, to mirror the transaction tree. The Segregated Witness Merkle Root, then, is included in the input field of the coinbase transaction. As such the Segregated Witness Merkle Root changes the transaction data of the coinbase transaction, its transaction ID, therefore influences the block header and, ultimately, the makeup of the blockchain.\n\nWuille\u2019s Segregated Witness proposal allows signatures to be removed from Bitcoin transactions, while maintaining Bitcoin's immutability, and without breaking any of the existing consensus rules.\n\nThe second part of this three-part story\u00a0will explore why Segregated Witness is actually useful.\n\nThanks go out to \nBlockstream\n\n co-founders Pieter Wuille and Mark Friedenbach, \nCiphrex\n\n CEO Eric Lombrozo, and \nBlocktrail\n\n CTO Ruben de Vries for providing information and added feedback.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 12, "day": 19}

The roadmap summary most relevant to bitcoin users is:\n\nBitcoin is shifting to a new economic policy, with possibly higher fees.\n\nCore block size does not change; there has been zero compromise on that issue. In the face of rising transaction volume\u200a\u2014\u200ait has doubled over the past year\u200a\u2014\u200agetting stuck at 1M results in higher fees, notable economic changes, and suffers from increased political risk by embracing an accidentally-created economic policy tool.\n\n\nChange By Design\nHigher fees and reshaping the fee market impact all bitcoin users, yet it is only mentioned obliquely in paragraph 18 of the roadmap:\n\nThese proposals help [\u2026] prevent defection between the miners from undermining the fee market behavior that will eventually fund security.\u201d\n\nand in the middle of paragraph 4 of\u00a0another BIP by the same devs:\n\nThe development of a fee market and the evolution towards an ecosystem that is able to cope with block space competition should be considered healthy. [\u2026] However, the purpose of such a change should be evolution with technological growth, and not kicking the can down the road because of a fear of change in economics.\u201d\n\nNotable devs think it necessary to change bitcoin to a different economic system with \u201chealthy\u201d competition for block space. In the field today, that is accomplished by maintaining the core block size in the face of rising transaction volume\u200a\u2014\u200aan outcome the current dev consensus has produced, and the roadmap continues.\n\nIn an optimal, transparent, open source environment, a BIP would be produced, covering a change in bitcoin\u2019s economics to a \u201chealthy fee market.\u201d This would be analyzed through the lenses of technical, economic, hard fork etc. risk. This has not happened.\n\nThere would also be a related BIP describing the basic requirements for a full node in terms of RAM, CPU processing, storage and network upload bandwidth, based on experiments\u200a\u2014\u200anot simulations\u200a\u2014\u200adone on a platform like planet-lab.org. This would help determine quantitatively how many nodes could propagate information rapidly enough to maintain Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized global consensus at a given block size.\n\nHow Satoshi Avoided a \u201cVisible Hand\u201d\nGetting stuck at 1M core block size transforms a historic DoS limit into an accidental policy tool. Satoshi\u00a0added\n\u00a0the 1M consensus limit in 2010, intentionally set above the free market fee range. This artificial ceiling acts against network DoS, raising the cost of attack. Setting the limit above free market range resulted in a\u00a0safety limit\n\u00a0reasonably free from politics.\n\nThe\u00a0update process\n\u00a0was also described by Satoshi in 2010.\n\nAs average block size approaches the 1M limit, the game theory picture changes. The accidental, artificial 1M limit becomes a Visible Hand in the market. Competition occurs not only for block space, but for developer consensus\u200a\u2014\u200abecause in this new economic system, the ability to freeze or move the 1M limit produces a system where humans\u200a\u2014\u200anot the free market directly\u200a\u2014\u200awield oversize power.\n\nBy accident or design, Satoshi managed to create a working free market and push this Visible Hand years into the future by setting the limit high, well above the free market range for transaction fees. The limit served for years as a DoS limit, exponentially increasing cost-of-attack, while a free market equilibrium range established itself.\n\nThis block size debate ultimately comes down to competing economic and system survival theories. One theory is that a free market range exists for block size, in absence of a hard limit. Another theory is that a hard limit is required to forcibly constrain the free market. Stalling on core block size changes the former to the latter\u200a\u2014\u200auncharted territory for bitcoin.\n\n\nA System-wide Upgrade To Avoid A System-wide Upgrade\nThe resultant bitcoin user and market view is muddled: From 2010 through Scaling Bitcoin:Montreal, it appeared that the core block size would see an increase. Following Scaling Bitcoin:Hong Kong, the roadmap abruptly switches direction to Segregated Witness (SW).\n\nSW avoids an ecosystem-wide hard fork through ecosystem-wide upgrades to bitcoin transactions, blocks, addresses, scripts, full nodes, miners, wallets, explorers, libraries, and APIs. All to provide partial relief to core block pressure assuming users upgrade\u200a\u2014\u200a1.6M if 100% upgrade, based on current usage.\n\nSW roll-out requires extensive software modifications just to maintain current functionality in the face of rising transaction volume. SW complicates bitcoin economics by splitting a \u201cblock\u201d into a basket of two economic resources\u200a\u2014\u200acore block and extended block\u200a\u2014\u200aeach with unique price incentives and (heavily intersecting) sets of actors.\n\nIn contrast, increased core block size is compatible with existing bitcoin software; Some wallets will work seamlessly with no change at all. The total number and scope of changes to wallets, databases, libraries etc. is very minimal. The high hurdle is the hard fork itself.\n\nOne of the explicit goals of the Scaling Bitcoin workshops was to funnel the chaotic core block size debate into an orderly decision making process. That did not occur. In hindsight, Scaling Bitcoin stalled a block size decision while transaction fee price and block space pressure continue to increase. Scaling Bitcoin was useful in surveying consensus on core block size. 2M appears to be the consensus most common denominator.\n\n\nSkipping Hard Questions Until Too Late\nThe roadmap skips the short term issues of:\n\n\nWhen are fees too high?\n\nWhat is the process for changing core block size then?\n\nWhy do we need high fees at this early stage of bitcoin\u2019s life?\n\n\nRather than an automated software system, a fixed core block size puts an economic policy tool in the hands of humans. Humans are making subjective decisions about \u201chealthy\u201d fee levels, what miner income should look like, and the relative expense of bitcoin transactions, rather than the free market.\n\nUsers have concerns that this roadmap and new economic direction dances obliquely around a shift of bitcoin from a network for P2P cash payments to a settlement system for as-yet-incomplete technology such as side chains or payment channels, pushing out businesses that bought into the original \u201cP2P electronic cash\u201d vision of bitcoin. As the\u00a0RootStock white paper\n\u00a0notes:\n\nIf Bitcoin block size is not increased via a hard-fork, when the next Bitcoin reward halves, Bitcoin transaction fees may become prohibitively high for certain applications.\u201d\n\nMaybe that\u2019s inevitable. However, in the short term, we have a disappointing situation where a subset of dev consensus is disconnected from the oft-mentioned desire to increase block size on the part of users, businesses, exchanges and miners. This reshapes bitcoin in ways full of philosophical and economic conflicts of interest. As\u00a0noted here, \u00a0inaction\n\u00a0changes bitcoin, sets it on a new path.\n\n\nWay Forward\nBitcoin is not an academic science project. Stalling on hard questions produces tangible market changes. Few have the luxury to pause until a new payment layer is developed on top of bitcoin-1\u2019s emerging settlement layer. Stuck-at-1M risks reversing bitcoin\u2019s network effect by pricing users out of the core blockchain, forcing them onto centralized platforms.\n\nA better way forward includes leadership on a definitive short term core block size decision, plain talk with users about exploring new fee market economic theories and system survival theories, and plain talk with users about the risks and possible negative consequences of getting stuck at 1M.\n\n\nCore block size resolution and validation cost edge cases are the top priorities. A positive outcome of Scaling Bitcoin was a consensus of 2M, assuming some validation DoS fixes. Segregated Witness can proceed in parallel, sans the assumptions that it\u2019s an easy change or that it mitigates economic issues described above.\n\nAnd finally, to remove long term moral hazard, core block size limit should be made dynamic, put in the realm of software, outside of human hands.\n\nBitcoin deserves a roadmap that balances the needs of everybody who has worked hard over the last six years to grow the entire ecosystem.\n\n\u2014Jeff Garzik and Gavin Andresen\n", "year": 2015, "month": 12, "day": 28}
{"title": "Segregated Witness: The Right Answer to the Wrong Question", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/segregated-witness-the-right-answer-to-the-wrong-question-1451312467/", "birthday": "Dec 28, 2015  9:21 AM EST", "date": "2015-12-28 14:21:00", "content": " CryptoBrief.com\n\nSegregated Witness, the proposal put forth by Blockstream developer Dr. Pieter Wuille, has been trumpeted as a block size scaling solution that gets around the difficult scenarios associated with increasing the block size utilizing a hard fork.\n\u00a0\n\nBut the problem is that, while Segregated Witness does provide benefit to the code, it misses one of the fundamental problems bitcoin has been experiencing: there are no true, long-term solutions on how to scale Bitcoin for mass-adoption. Instead, the focus has been on developing solutions on top of bitcoin. Further, the stigma associated with a hard fork acts as a hindrance to further development.\n\u00a0\n\nSegregated Witness 101\n\nWhen looking at the block size problem, it helps to think of it as a bucket of marbles. The 1MB block size can carry a certain number of transactions the same as a bucket can only carry so many marbles. As more transactions try to fit in the block, naturally some are unable; they fall out.\u00a0\nWhat Segregated Witness does is remove the signature from the transaction and stores it in a separate data structure. By removing the signature from the transaction, the size of the that transaction decreases.\u00a0\nIn his blog post about Segreated Witness, Gavin Andresen said:\n\n\nfor example, the simplest possible one-input, one-output segregated witness transaction would be about 90 bytes of transaction data plus 80 or so bytes of signature\u2014only those 90 bytes need to squeeze into the one megabyte block, instead of 170 bytes. More complicated multi-signature transactions save even more.\u201d\nUsing our marble analogy, in this most basic of examples, each marble is shrunk down by approximately 47%. In essence, we find that we can have 47% more one-to-one transactions in the block size.\u00a0\nBut at its core, Segregated Witness is compression and optimization of the code; it\u2019s not a true scaling feature. There remains only 1MB of block space and when that fills, the problems that the network are currently experiencing come back again.\u00a0\nThe Hard Fork Stigma\n\nBitcoin is at a crossroads right now. On one hand, there is a significant push to keep the blocksize at the arbitrary 1MB size\u2014there has been no data presented suggesting this is the optimal size. And on the other hand, there is the need to prove that bitcoin can be scaled to a point where it can handle transactions from a growing user base.\u00a0\nThe problem has to do with a stigma associated with implementing a change via a hard fork.\nThe concern with a hard fork is that it results in two parallel chains where the winner takes all and the losers are harmed. It can result in double spends and uncertainty as to which chain is going to win. When dealing with a market cap of over $6 billion, concern about that is certainly warranted.\u00a0\nBut the problem is that inaction\u2014or a decision not to act\u2014results in the same outcome. The inability for the community to get behind a hard fork to scale bitcoin even to 2MB, as proposed by Jeff Garzik in BIP 102, can create an event as chaotic as a hard fork.\u00a0\nIn an email to the Bitcoin Core Dev team, Garzik postulated that by not scaling bitcoin and instead pushing for higher transaction fees, it would create an economic change event, which \u201cis a period of market chaos, where large changes to prices and sets of economic actors occurs over a short time period.\u201d\nBoth are problematic and can cause significant damage to the community. However, what a proposal like BIP 102 does is get past the stigma of a hard fork and allow the developers to do what they\u2019re good at: analyze data and make decisions based on it.\u00a0\nThere is no doubt that there is a need to scale bitcoin. While Segregated Witness is, fundamentally, a great move, it doesn\u2019t solve the problem that there is a stigma associated with hard forking the code, which will be an inevitable necessity to further scale the protocol.\nSegregated Witness Should Hard Fork\n\nIn a series of Tweets, BitGo Engineer Jameson Lopp argued that node operators have a responsibility to keep current with software that is responsible for securing people\u2019s money. In essence, if you\u2019re going to run a node that is securing the Bitcoin network, which inherently is securing people\u2019s money, the tech needs to be upgraded.\u00a0\n1) If you administer a computer that is used to secure people's money, you have responsibility to keep it running like a well-oiled machine.\u2014 Jameson Lopp (@lopp) December 23, 2015\n\nTo offer the necessary data that developers need, Segregated Witness should be pushed through as a hard fork, where those that do not upgrade are left behind. Segregated Witness is not controversial; it\u2019s exactly what Bitcoin needs. Therefore, it would show what a hard fork is like and shake out some of the nodes that are not going to update their software.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s no doubt that scaling Bitcoin is a difficult conversation; however, it is going to continue coming up. Even with Segregated Witness, the network will reach a point where it needs to scale again. Compressing data can only work so much. At some point, you can\u2019t make the marbles any smaller and you have to go find a bigger bucket.\u00a0", "year": 2015, "month": 12, "day": 28}

While only Starbucks and Target are currently supported, Fold is looking to integrate Whole Foods, CVS, and Home Depot, according to a recent interview with Fold Founder Matt Luongo.\u00a0\n\n\"We\u2019ve also been looking at Walmart, CVS, and Home Depot,\" Luongo said. \"The top 30 retailers in the U.S. are all in our sights.\u201d\n\nWhile the addition of Fold into the Airbitz ecosystem could be seen as a simple way to streamline the gift card exchange process, Airbitz CEO Paul Puey has a larger vision.\u00a0\n\n\"Airbitz aims to secure digital assets across multiple applications, starting with our own,\" Puey said. \"\nWhile we started with digital currencies, we're already securing login credentials with BitID. With the launch of the Fold integration, we're now securing gift cards, just a new type of digital asset.\u201d\u00a0\n\nBitID, a decentralized authentication protocol developed by Eric Larchev\u00eaque, allows users to replace passwords with bitcoin private keys and avoid the account creation process entirely.\u00a0\n\nFold is not the first company to resell unused gift cards \u2013 Raise, Cardpool and ABC Gift Cards all purchase and sell discounted gift cards online. Gyft, one of Fold's main competitors, accepts bitcoin as well. Samsung even released an update for its Samsung Pay app last week that allows users to purchase \"50 popular merchant gift cards\" directly in the app for face value.\u00a0\n\nHowever, by integrating Fold's service directly into the Airbitz mobile wallet, both companies are hoping to reduce friction and streamline the process for their users.\n\nBut as these services become more popular, some websites are beginning to crack down on the sale of gift cards as they can serve as a way to launder money from stolen credit cards.\u00a0\n\nBitify, an Australian bitcoin and litecoin marketplace, recently banned the sale of all digital gift cards as some buyers \"claimed that [the gift cards were] purchased with stolen credit cards.\"\n\nFold says it has put in place preventive measures to deter the resale of illegally obtained gift cards.\u00a0\n\n\"We've built a best-in-class fraud prevention system to protect ourselves and our customers,\" said Luongo.\n\nThis partnership has been in the works since the beginning of 2015 when both Airbitz and Fold were participating in accelerators in Silicon Valley (Plug and Play and Boost VC, respectively).\u00a0\n\n\u201c\nI\u2019ve been promoting Fold since 2014 when almost no one had heard of the service,\u201d \nsaid Puey.\u00a0\n\n\nAirbitz is available for free on both iOS and Android. To take advantage of this new partnership, create an Airbitz wallet and navigate to the 'More' tab bar on the bottom of the screen. From there, choose the \"Buy/Sell Bitcoin\" option and select which retailer's gift card you'd like to purchase. Load up your bitcoin, swipe to send, and a preloaded barcode will appear, which you can scan at checkout.\u00a0\n\nFold works at any location that accepts U.S. gift cards. This includes Canada, Mexico, Australia, Ireland, Hong Kong, Great Britain, Macau and Spain, according to their website.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 12, "day": 14}

Byrne, the Chairman and CEO of Overstock.com (NASDAQ: OSTK), confirmed in a phone interview with \nBitcoin Magazine \nthat the SEC had declared the company\u2019s Form S-3 statement effective, bypassing a large hurdle for the crypto-friendly firm.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cEffective means approved in this sense,\u201d Byrne said. \u201cYou file it [Form S-3] with the SEC, you go back and forth until it is approved, and then it sits on the shelf. It can sit on the shelf for 3-4 years before you have to do the process again.\u201d\n\nForm S-3 is a registration form mandated by the SEC that gives established companies an easier path to issue publicly traded securities. If a company has at least 12 months of properly filed reports with the SEC and is compliant with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, it is eligible to file a Form S-3.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOnce it has been approved, it [an actual offering of securities] doesn\u2019t require any further approval,\u201d he said.\n\u00a0\n\n\nBut while the company has approval to issue securities, it has made no determination yet on if it will.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t confirm that there will be an offer. I can\u2019t comment on if there will be an offer\u201d Byrne said. \u201cI am studying that now, trying to decide if there should be one, but I can\u2019t even comment if there is one on the horizon.\u201d\n\n\nIn its Form S-3, Overstock.com sought approval to issue up to $500 million in new securities in the form of either common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, debt securities, or units. In its Form S-3, the company said:\n\n\n\u201cThis prospectus provides you with a general description of the security we may offer. Each time we sell securities, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of that offering.\u201d\n\n\nThe SEC approval is a boon to Overstock, but also to the bitcoin ecosystem as issuing shares on the blockchain has been a use case discussed for some time.\n\u00a0 \n\u201cThe great innovation in bitcoin is the underlying technology,\u201d he said, referring to the blockchain.\n\u00a0\n\n\nt0.com has built its own proprietary blockchain, which will then be publicly distributed. While Byrne was unable to go into detail about the specifics of the technology, he did say that trades would be hashed onto the Bitcoin blockchain at some point in the process.\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Future of t0\n\nWhile getting approval to issue up to $500 million in Overstock.com securities on its blockchain is momentous, t0 has already been working for some time now. In July, Overstock sold the first cryptobond on the blockchain. FNY Managed Accounts agreed to buy the entire $5 million bond as a proof of concept, though there were assurances in place in case it failed.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already built the technology to do stock loans, which is important for Wall Street\u2026 to bring efficient pricing to stock loans,\u201d Byrne said.\u00a0\n\n\n\nA stock loan is where one party agrees to lend its securities\u2014shares of a company, for example\u2014to another firm in exchange for a negotiated fee. At any one time, there is $1.7 trillion out on loan from an overall $101 trillion in financial securities on the global stock market. The arbiters in the middle, orchestrating these deals, generate all the revenue. By putting it onto a public ledger, the stock holders can increase the amount they generate via the negotiated fee.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cThis [Form S-3] could generate new things for us to investigate with crypto. We\u2019ve got a really good crypto team now, which is the hurdle other companies are finding difficult,\u201d Byrne explained. Finding quality talent is always a problem for technology firms, but especially for those in the still very young bitcoin space. \u201cA lot of people applied to us starting about a year ago. We had the pick of the talent around the country and we got a number of people and then started adding to that group.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut fundamentally, what is a firm like t0.com doing under the control of an eCommerce site like Overstock.com?\n\n\n\n\u201cI think that, in the long term, these two business don\u2019t belong together. You might see it split off, you might see us take outside investment, there\u2019s lot of options. I almost want to turn it over into the hands of another company with which it would be more aligned,\u201d he explained.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhile Byrne didn\u2019t have a specific example of what could happen, he did say that he had been fielding many calls. \u201cI\u2019ve been holding them off until now. You could well see a venture capital or private equity fund invest in this and then we move it outside of the Overstock group,\u201d Byrne said.\u00a0\n\n\nWhile Overstock investigates whether it wants to issue securities, one thing is clear: the sector has gotten a little closer to abolishing T+3\u2014the current time from which a trade takes place and when it has to be settled three days later\u2014and moving to a true T0 environment.\u00a0\n\n\nJacob Cohen Donnelly is a consultant and journalist in the bitcoin space.

For the first time, customers of Genesis Mining will be able to mine for Ether, the fuel that powers the Ethereum network.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOur customers asked and we listened. Due to our large-scale GPU mining activities we are glad to offer significant parts of our farms for Ether mining in the cloud. Users can therefore benefit from our economy of scale and our geothermal-powered and optimized GPU mining rigs in Iceland. We are bullish on Ethereum and look forward to giving our customers the chance to profit from this exciting innovation and also support the network,\u201d Marco Streng, CEO of Genesis Mining, said in a statement.\u00a0\n\nTo some, Ethereum is considered Bitcoin v2.0. It was developed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and has since gone on to raise more than $15 million to allow participants to create and execute smart contracts. A smart contract is a protocol that can execute the rules found in a contract without the need for human intervention.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOur GPU mining farms are mining X11 and Ethereum. We are expanding them continuously, and since we are selling Ethereum in the cloud now, we are ramping up more Ethereum mining capacity,\u201d Streng said in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0\n\nGenesis Mining already had a farm of GPU miners \u2014 which are inefficient at mining bitcoin \u2014 because it offers X11 mining. Since so many users were interested in Ethereum, the company chose to divert resources to the task of mining Ether. This move has no impact on its bitcoin mining farm.\u00a0\n\n\"More miners on the network definitely helps increase the network security. It\u2019s great to see operations organizations such as Genesis take an interest in supporting Ethereum,\u201d said Vitalik Burterin in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0\n\nContracts are for One Year\n\nThere is currently an effort underway at Ethereum to transition from proof of work to proof of stake, which grants power to those who hold coins. The more of a coin that someone holds, the more they are able to mine. Because of this, Genesis Mining will be offering only short-term contracts.\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt is a one-year mining plan which focuses on Ethereum and switches to X11 after Ethereum switches from PoW to PoS until the year [2016] is over,\u201d Streng said. \u201cIt is an accelerated ROI [return on investment] compared to our lifetime contracts because of the low prices, zero fees (all contained upfront) and shorter timeframe.\u201d\n\nGenesis Mining will be offering three plans. Small-scale mining is 3MHs for $53.97, medium-scale mining is 50MHs for $899.50 and large-scale mining is 100MHs for $1,799.\n\u00a0\n\nJacob Cohen Donnelly is a consultant and journalist in the bitcoin space.

The e-Residency\nprogram launched by the government of Estonia is another such initiative.\u00a0\n\nThe program offers anyone, anywhere, a digital identity issued by the Estonian government and the possibility to start and operate a business online under Estonian regulations. The foreigners who become e-residents of Estonia are not automatically entitled to physical residency in the small Baltic state, but they can base their online financial life there.\n\nEstonia, a country at the forefront of modern e-government, has been offering efficient online services to its citizens for more than a decade.\u00a0\n\n\u201cBy offering e-residents the same services, Estonia is proudly pioneering the idea of a country without borders,\u201d proudly states the e-residency website. In particular, e-residents can digitally sign, verify and encrypt documents and contracts, establish an Estonian company online in 24 hours with a physical address in Estonia provided by an external service, and administer the company from anywhere in the world.\n\nCurrently, establishing an Estonian bank account for the company requires one in-person meeting at one of the banks that recognize e-resident smart ID cards \u2013 currently LHV, Swedbank and SEB \u2013 but once the account is established e-residents can manage e-banking and remote money transfers from anywhere in the world.\u00a0\n\nAn appealing feature of e-residency for entrepreneurs is that, in Estonia, company income is not taxed. Therefore, compliance is simplified and all income is available for re-investment. However, since e-residency doesn\u2019t imply tax residency, e-residents are supposed to pay taxes at home for the money that they take out of the company.\n\nNow, the Estonian government is partnering with Bitnation to offer a public notary service to Estonian e-residents based on blockchain technology.\u00a0\n\n\u201cVia the international Bitnation Public Notary, e-residents, regardless of where they live or do business, will be able to notarize their marriages, birth certificates, business contracts, and much more on the blockchain,\u201d states a joint press release.\n\n\"I'm delighted to work with Estonia's e-residency program to set a standard practice of competition of governance services on a global market, and to enable others to exercise self-determination and follow Bitnation's path to sovereignty,\u201d said Tarkowski Tempelhof in the press release.\n\n\u201cThe Republic of Estonia is on the forefront of innovation when it comes to e-governance,\u201d Tarkowski Tempelhof told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThey\u2019re mostly young and open-minded, eager to test new technologies to improve their services. Additionally, their processes are quite streamlined, which is original for being a government, and needless to say, very refreshing.\u201d\n\nIf a couple gets married on the public notary, it doesn\u2019t mean they get married in the jurisdiction of Estonia, or in any other nation state jurisdiction, notes the press release. Instead, they get married in the \u201cblockchain jurisdiction.\u201d\u00a0\n\nInternational Business Times\nnotes\nthat, besides marriages, blockchain technology can provides a worldwide legally binding proof of existence and integrity of contractual agreements for things such as banking, incorporating companies quickly and cheaply and generally empowering entrepreneurs and citizens around the world.\u00a0\n\n\"In Estonia we believe that people should be able to freely choose their digital/public services best fit to them, regardless of the geographical area where they were arbitrarily born,\u201d said e-Residency Program Director Kaspar Korjus. \u201cWe're truly living in exciting times when nation states and virtual nations compete and collaborate with each other on an international market, to provide better governance services.\"\n\nIn fact, the importance and potential impact of the Estonian government\u2019s move shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. Here we have the government of a nation state, a full member of the European Union, acknowledging a virtual nation as a legitimate partner for the development and gradual implementation of next-generation governance services.\u00a0\n\n\u201cMy aim is to see a world where hundreds of thousands or millions of governance service providers in a free global market competing through offering better services at a better value, rather than through the use of force within arbitrary lines in the sand,\u201d Tarkowski Tempelhof told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cTo that end, seeing nation state governments starting to provide governance services on a free global market as well, like The Republic of Estonia, is encouraging, and a step in the right direction.\u00a0 Now we need more nation state governments, as well as open source protocols joining the global market.\u201d\n\nTarkowski Tempelhof added that, realistically, it\u2019s more likely that small nations will adopt the technology in the short term.\u00a0\n\n\u201cCountries and city states that come to mind are Singapore, Lichtenstein, Andorra, etc.,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re also likely to see nations in the developing world leapfrogging in terms of governance technologies.\u201d\n\nPhoto Steve Jurvetson\n/ Flickr(CC)\n\n\n", "year": 2015, "month": 11, "day": 30}

After the initial conference in Montreal in September, Bitcoin's engineering and academic community will gather in Hong Kong later this week to discuss how best to scale up the network to allow for more than a handful of transactions per second.\n\nTo get a feel for what to expect from the workshop, Bitcoin Magazine\nspoke with Pindar Wong, co-founder of Hong Kong's first licensed ISP and the Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong planning committee chair, and MIT Digital Currency Initiative's Neha Narula, Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong program chair\n.\n\n\nWhat will result from the upcoming @ScalingBitcoin workshop? https://t.co/DQxvHXuc7v\u2014 Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) December 1, 2015\n\nBM: What do you hope to accomplish in Hong Kong?\n\n\nWong\n: \u201cWith these conferences, we're trying to foster the educational and technical understanding that the scaling Bitcoin discussion is both broad and nuanced. In doing so, we hope to help build community, not by controlling the dialogue, but by synchronizing it by focusing on facts, not opinion. By using the scientific and academic approach we're trying to foster collaboration.\u201d\n\nNarula\n: \u201cOne of the amazing things about this workshop is that we're actually going to get specific plans. We're going to have presenters talk about the BIPs [Bitcoin Improvement Proposals] that they have created, their designs, their ideas and their implementations. And we're even going to get some test data and experimental results.\u201d\n\nBM: Is this more specific approach the biggest difference as compared to the first edition in Montreal?\n\n\nNarula\n: \u201cI think so. One major goal of phase one was community building, and really getting people together in one place who haven't had a lot of opportunity to talk to each other face-to-face. This time we're really trying to focus on the question of scaling Bitcoin; what are the strategies and techniques we can use to do that? The presentations are all directly related to the question of how to realize more transactions per second on Bitcoin's blockchain, including solutions like layering protocols.\n\nWong\n: \u201cAnother concrete difference, the main reasons we began this process, is that we recognized that it would be much easier for the Chinese Bitcoin community to participate in Hong Kong. So we'll have Chinese miners, pool operators, ASIC providers, and also those who host facilities. So all the diverse voices, that we don't normally have, that we normally don't see on the development mailing list, will be there. That's the thing that I am most excited about.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nBM: Are you expecting a concrete scaling solution to come out of this conference?\n\n\nNarula\n: \u201cI think it's important to note that this conference is not about forcing anyone to do anything. It's about providing the atmosphere and the space for this kind of discussion to happen. Instead of this discussion happening through the media, or through IRC, or on forums, it can actually happen in part face-to-face.\u201d\n\nWong\n: \u201cWe're basically a platform. We've been very clear at the beginning that we're not about making decisions, because it's not up to us. That said, it would be great if the workshops could help to achieve this notion of consensus. Obviously, given that Bitcoin is essentially a bottom-up structure, where everyone has their own points of view, consensus is not something that you can impose. It has to emerge, so we hope that having the dialogue, the communication, and this idea of collaboration might help.\u201d\n\n\n\nBM: But not everyone will make it to Hong Kong, of course. The most notable example being Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Core developer Gavin Andresen.\n\n\nNarula: \n\u201cBefore phase one there was a lot of outreach activity ... it was the first time we've had all the five Core developers come to an event. It was a very precious opportunity for everyone to come together and have an understanding for where everyone's coming from. Similarly, for phase two, we've done outreach to all the key players, to make sure that they feel welcome, including Gavin. But I think that the distance is a bit much for him at this point. And we do recognize that it's a long way to come.\u00a0\n\nAnd it is up to anyone to decide to come \u2013 or not. That's why we've also made sure there are good online mechanisms. Most of the heavy talks are early in the morning to make sure that those on the American east coast can tune in to the live-stream and contribute through IRC.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nBM: How big a part will the block-size dispute play?\n\n\nWong\n: \u201cThe block size is just one dimension. There are many different approaches to scale Bitcoin, such as layer two mechanisms that were touched on in phase one in Montreal. Even the issue of 'What does it mean to scale Bitcoin?' is not really settled; different people have different views.\n\nBut yes, as opposed to phase one, we will look specifically at the block-size parameter in Hong Kong. We're also looking at the testing that has been done in between phase one and phase two, and we've set up a cloud infrastructure at the conference hall, so people who have developed code and want to test it can do so.\u201d\n\n\n\nBM: One common criticism against the first workshop in Montreal was that there wasn't really any result to show for. Some even allege that the conferences are a stalling mission, in order to prevent the block-size limit from being increased and win time for alternative scaling solutions to be developed.\n\n\nWong\n: \u201cWhether we're stalling or not is in the eye of the beholder. I do know that the volunteers who have come forward to organize these conferences, like myself, are all working as fast as we can.\n\nThe more substantive point is: Did phase one achieve what we said phase one would achieve? And did the period in between phase one and phase two achieve what we originally intended it to achieve? I would say that we've had mixed success.\n\nFrom a community-building perspective and from an educational perspective, phase one was phenomenally successful. However, I do recognize that in terms of the technical consensus, we're still in relatively early days. There is a lot of testing to be done. In some sense, therefore, phase two is really phase 1.5; we are half a phase behind. I take a lot of responsibility for that. I thought this would be the right amount of time and the right amount of space that people would need, but that might have been a bit optimistic. It would have been better to have more time between phases.\u201d\n\nNarula\n: \u201cI think it's important to note that this is an ongoing process. I only got involved after phase one myself, but everyone I spoke to about that conference said it was one of the best Bitcoin conferences they've been to. That was in part because it was really about the technical discussions, not just a sales pitch from various companies, and VCs [venture capitalists], and things like that.\n\nWe intend the second phase to be really about the community and the piece of software that they're building, too. Because Bitcoin really is an amazing system. But, unfortunately, it's also extraordinarily complicated, and there are a lot of moving pieces. That's why we need things like this conference. Let\u2019s work on it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nScaling Bitcoin Hong Kong will take place on the 6th and 7th of December.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nF2Pool, the world's largest Bitcoin mining pool, maintains that changing its code to allow bigger blocks through BIP 101\n\nor Bitcoin XT is not an option.\u00a0\n\n\nWang Chun, the operator of the China-based pool controlling some\n 20 percent of hashing power, dismissed the idea of an exponential growth rate of the maximum block size for 20 years leading to 8-gigabyte blocks.\n\n\n\nAsked by Bitcoin Magazine, Chun said: \u201cWe cannot predict what will happen years into the future, and we think a first step to 2 megabytes should be enough for now.\u201d\n\nThe block-size dispute \u2013 which represents a tradeoff between the number of transactions\n\nthe Bitcoin network can handle and its\n decentralization\n\n\u2013 might reach a critical juncture over the next weeks. A large segment of Bitcoin's development community will discuss the issue at the upcoming\n Scaling Bitcoin\n\nworkshop in Hong Kong in the first week of December, while\n several\n\n prominent\n\nBitcoin companies have stated they intend to change their code to allow for bigger blocks that same month.\n\nChun, too, believes that raising the block-size limit is an urgent matter, explaining:\n\n\u201cI think it is urgent, because the transaction volume is increasing on the blockchain, and if the price rises in near future, it will push the transaction volume to be even higher. I think the max block size should be raised as soon as possible, but it should not be raised too much. Two megabytes is preferred as the first step.\u201d\n\nOne possible solution,  BIP 101, is programmed to increase the maximum block size to 8 megabytes if a threshold of 75 percent of mining power accepts the change. Once activated, this limit is set to double every two years for 20 years, ultimately leading to an 8-gigabyte block-size limit.\u00a0\n\nThis patch, which is designed by former Bitcoin Core lead developer Gavin Andresen, was implemented in Bitcoin XT, the alternative Bitcoin implementation run by Google veteran Mike Hearn. BIP 101 is also favored by several\n\n prominent\n\nBitcoin companies, as well as Slush Pool.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSwitching to BIP 101 or Bitcoin XT is a bad idea; we will never do that,\u201d Chun reiterated his  earlier position. \u201cAfter a meeting with some other Chinese pools earlier this year, we proposed an 8-megabyte limit, because we thought Gavin's initial 20 megabyte proposal was too big for us. I always thought 2 megabytes would be better as a first step, but I did not want to offend Gavin with a 10 times smaller proposal. Gavin then answered us with BIP 101, which due to its steep growth curve is essentially 8 gigabytes, so it\u2019s done. I don\u2019t trust Gavin anymore \u2013 nor Hearn for that matter.\u201d\n\n\nOn the  Bitcoin development mailing list, Chun recently suggested raising the maximum block size in accordance with the block halving. As such, the block-size limit would be raised to 2 megabytes as soon as possible, followed by an increase to 4 megabytes halfway through 2016, up to 32 megabytes by 2028.\n\nAlternatively, Chun said he would be willing to implement an incremental increase to 8 megabytes over four years, as proposed by  Blockstream\n\nCEO and hashcash inventor Dr. Adam Back. This \u201c2-4-8\u201d option seems \nacceptable\n to a significant segment of the Bitcoin Core development team, as well as some prominent \nindustry\n\n members.\n\nAnd even though Back proposed 2-4-8 as a temporary solution, Chun suggested that it could even be more than that.\n\n\nWe do not necessarily consider an 8 megabyte block-size limit a temporary solution. We don\u2019t know what will happen moving forward. But we definitely think 8 megabytes is enough for the foreseeable future. Presumably, at least for the next three to four years.\u201d\n\n\n", "year": 2015, "month": 12, "day": 1}

(His departure was rather too sudden to suit the sensibilities of his \u201cHP Way\u201d bosses, but that\u2019s another story.)\n\n\nCommencing to work almost non-stop through long days and nights \u201cnot because of deadlines, but because I loved it so much,\u201d Belshe was driving across town with fellow computer geek and visionary Rob McCool one day when they were simultaneously awe-struck by the same sight: a large billboard with \u201chttp:\u201d sprawled across its face, followed by a web address.\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d McCool exclaimed. \u201cI never thought I would see that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe billboard spoke to him,\u201d Belshe remembers. \u201cThat\u2019s when I realized that what we were doing really matters.\u201d\n\nThis theme of engagement with things of import is a recurrent theme in Belshe\u2019s life. It partly explains the intriguing mix of five-star companies and start-ups dotting his resume. After HP and Netscape, Microsoft was another major stop; from there he migrated to Google just in time to help lead the development of Chrome. He stayed there for a half-decade.\n\nStart-ups included Good Technology, Remarq and his own Lookout Software with partner Eric Hahn. All of them were successes in their own right, though it was neither money nor conventional pride that drove Belshe\u2019s journeys along the tech frontiers of his day. It has always been more about using his supple intelligence and imagination to help bring something interesting and important into the world, most always with highly technical solutions that ultimately filter down into the usefulness and parlance of everyday users who have no particular technical skill.\n\nAnd now there is Bitcoin security company BitGo, steadily picking up market share as the first \u201cmulti-signature\u201d wallet in the Bitcoin world. The platform makes use of Belshe\u2019s problem-solving and programming ingenuity to bring greater ease and utility to the thorny problem of securing bitcoins.\n\nIt is a kind of gift, this ability to bridge the worlds of software engineering via complex, exacting code and an end product that the proverbial Iowa Grandma can manage with ease from the comfort of her kitchen table.\n\nAs Belshe himself freely admitted in a recent plain-spoken blog post at belshe.com, Bitcoin isn\u2019t anywhere near reaching Grandma yet.\n\n\u201cBitcoin in Denial\u201d ran the headline on his post, which conveyed a \u201cSlow down, this is gonna take a while\u201d message to those who envision Bitcoin triumphing over fiat currencies and the credit card industry and reaching Grandma by next week or next year. But if anyone will eventually be able to carve the road to her, it will be Belshe.\n\nTwo decades into a tech career that he remembers being ignited by a computer magazine that his electrical engineer father brought home, he now finds himself at a mid-career sweet spot. With deep experience behind him, industry contacts and resources galore, and still copious energy, he is committed to making Bitcoin the most secure digital asset tool ever devised without its users, in his words, \u201chaving to learn how to operate a digital asset vault.\u201d\n\nBelshe co-founded BitGo in 2013, just a year after discovering Bitcoin and loading up on a bunch of coins for himself and various friends on a dedicated offline laptop he kept under his couch. \u201cWith Bitcoin\u2019s price going up, I realized I had a staggering amount of money just sitting there on a laptop. I was following best practices, but I felt scared enough to look for a better way to store all these coins.\u201d\n\nA quick survey found him surprised that there really weren\u2019t any better security mousetraps at the time, so he set about to invent one. Anyone who knows Belshe could have predicted it wouldn\u2019t take him long.\n\nBitGo launched the world\u2019s first multi-signature wallet last August, created by Belshe himself using a \u201cP2SH\u201d protocol that was developed by Gavin Andresen, chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation and Bitcoin\u2019s lead core developer at the time.\n\nWhile his service won\u2019t quite reach Grandma yet, it has given Bitcoin holders an unparalleled means of securely holding their funds without fear of either being hacked or suffering some human error of forgetfulness or misplacement. It turns out, by the way, that error is a far more common cause of lost bitcoins than is the more feared specter of malevolent hackers.\n\n\nWe wanted a system that doesn\u2019t depend on anyone else and wasn\u2019t vulnerable to theft, a lost hard disk or paper wallet, or a forgotten-and- now-gone password,\u201d Belshe says. \u201cThe challenge is always this: How do you improve security in a way users understand?\u201d\n\n\nBelshe & Co. appear to be meeting that challenge with growth figures ($1 billion transacted in the third quarter) and a corporate profile for which less substantive startups would no doubt hand over a good portion of their Bitcoin vaults. P2SH or pay to script hash addresses have grown more than 84 percent over the past 90 days, and BitGo controls the majority share of market for P2SH Bitcoin addresses.\n\nIt\u2019s all big-time fun, which is one crucial metric Belshe applies to virtually all his professional endeavors. But even more important, if he were advising young people just launching their careers, is this: \u201cDo something that matters.\u201d\n\nOne gets the sense that having fun and doing things that matter have become almost one and the same thing for Belshe. That\u2019s just one more sweet spot in a career from which the Bitcoin world is now benefiting in ways that matter greatly to it.\n\n\n\n\nThis post originally appeared in yBitcoin.", "year": 2015, "month": 12, "day": 1}

Venables as the inventors of the technology.\n\n\nPaul Walker\n\n is the co-head of technology at Goldman and a member of the Board of Directors of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC). According to Nathaniel Popper\u2019s book \u201cDigital Gold\u201d and his adaptation for American Banker, \u201cWhen Goldman Sachs Began Flirting with Bitcoin,\u201d Walker led a panel to educate the banks clients about virtual currencies. Popper writes\n that Walker, \n \u201cindicated that the bank was taking a hard look at how the blockchain might be used to change basic things about how banks do business.\u201d\n\n\nPhil Venables, managing director and chief information security officer at Goldman Sachs has been described by American Banker\n\nas an \u201coutspoken industry leader.\u201d\n\nThe patent application addresses chain of custody of an asset, counterparty risk and settlement through a cryptocurrency called SETLcoin. \u00a0The patent describes a colored coin scheme referred to as a PIC or \u201cPositional Item inside Cryptographic currency\u201d:\n\n\n[...] \nFor example, dollars available on the SETLcoin network represented by, e.g., PIC \u2018USD\u2019 may be authoritatively issued by, for example, the U.S. Treasury.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\nSETLcoin, an amalgamation of \u201csettlement\u201d and \u201ccoin,\u201d boasts near instantaneous execution and settlement:\n\n\n [...] \ncryptographic currency transactions are independently and extemporaneously generated, verified, and executed within the network, without the risks associated with traditional clearing houses that can delay settlements for several days\n.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nFurther, the application defines a cryptocurrency or \u201ccryptographic currency\u201d as a\n\n\n [...] digital medium of exchange that enables distributed, rapid, cryptographically secure, confirmed transactions for goods and/or services.\u201d\n\nThe patent goes on to describe an \u201catomic commitment protocol\u201d and \u201cfungibility engine.\u201d \u00a0The patent also explains how a settlement cryptocurrency would also make credit checks obsolete.\n\nThe Complexity of Asset Ownership\n\n\nAccording to the patent application, SETLcoin ownership can be used to prevent fraud, including float fraud such as kiting. One of the earliest cases (if not the earliest) of ownership fraud at Goldman Sachs dates back to 1884 as detailed in an article for the New York Times, \u00a0\u201cNote Brokers \u2019 Responsibility\n \u201d from March 19, 1886 and further highlighted in the book \u201cMoney and Power: How Goldman Sachs Came to Rule the World\n.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nA forged note for $1,100 endorsed by a Carl Wolf was sold by Goldman to a Frederick E. Douglas. Wolf then \"ran away.\" Douglas was unsuccessful in suing Goldman to recover his losses. \u201cMoney and Power\u201d notes that this was one of the first legal examinations of the role and responsibilities of a financial intermediary.\n\nA more recent examination of the complexities of asset ownership (and unwinding of shares) was detailed this summer by Bloomberg in \u201dBanks Forgot Who Was Supposed to Own Dell Shares.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe Depository Trust Company\n\n(DTC), the central securities depository subsidiary of DTCC, according to their website:\n\n\nprovides settlement services for virtually all broker-to-broker equity and listed corporate and municipal debt securities transactions in the U.S.\u201d\n\nPatrick Byrne, the CEO of e-commerce firm Overstock, has written about DTCC in \u201cThe DTCC\u2019s CNS naked short selling residue\n\u201d and most recently the clearing debacle in \u201cGoldman Sachs Internal Memo (Yesterday): \u2018Easy to Borrow List to be Discontinued.\u2019\n \u00a0\n\n\nByrne sued Goldman Sachs and others\n\nfor allegedly naked short selling his company\u2019s shares. That is \u201cclearing operations at the banks intentionally failed to locate and deliver borrowed shares for clients shorting stocks.\u201d It is somewhat ironic here because it appears that Goldman\u2019s cryptocurrency application could prevent the very same behavior it allegedly participated in according to the lawsuit.\u00a0\n\nByrne embraced cryptocurrency as a result and started the Overstock subsidiary t\u00d8\n\nwhich is also using digital currencies and blockchain to settle trades and asset ownership.\n\n\nAccording to t\u00d8\u2019s website they provide: \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nradical transparency and true settlement (which) combine to grant real, unambiguous ownership -- nearly instantly. If you buy it, you own it. It's that simple .\u201d\n\nTrustless\n\n\nCryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are lauded for their trustless nature -- that is to say, there is no reliance on a trusted third party. \u00a0Goldman\u2019s patent filing however allows for the possible introduction of an \u201cauthoritative source\u201d such as the Securities and Exchange Commission:\n\n\n...there are no prior ownership rights when an SETLcoin is first issued; therefore, [...] {In addition to} [...] one or more trusted nodes [...] a government entity, {such as} the Security Exchange Commission, or other entity {can} [...] verify and authentic the issuer's transaction.\u201d\n\nBlockchain Cometh\n\n\nGoldman Sachs and IDG Capital Partners co-led a $50 million strategic investment round\n\nin Bitcoin company Circle in late April of this year. This was the first publicly announced cryptocurrency investment by Goldman. \u00a0However, as reported by CB Insights, Goldman\u2019s investment activity into fintech startups has been intensifying.\n\nAccording to the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), Goldman is the fifth largest bank holding company\n\nwith $859.93 billion in assets as of June 2015. The cryptocurrency technology patent was filed prior to Goldman\u2019s membership in R3 CEV. R3 is working on a common blockchain standard for its members (which includes many of the banks listed in FFIEC).\u00a0\n\nGoldman\u2019s thoughts on Bitcoin were broadcasted at it Talks@GS in \u201cThe Evolution of Bitcoin\u201d and podcast \u201cExchanges at Goldman Sachs\u201d in Episode 16, The Future of Finance.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto \nBjoertvedt\n\n\n / \nCreative Commons\n\n\n\n", "year": 2015, "month": 12, "day": 1}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nThe \nLightning Network\n\n is a design improvement for Bitcoin that could allow users to make \nmicropayments\n\n in a decentralized manner and help the entire network scale more efficiently over time. While this proposal has received a large amount of attention in the Bitcoin community, there is another, similar option currently in development by \nC.J. Plooy.\n\n\nPlooy recently gave a presentation on his alternative implementation, \nAmiko Pay,\n at \nScaling Bitcoin\n\n Montreal. During his talk, Plooy noted:\n\n\n\u201cIf you look at the basic design of the Lightning Network -- a network of \npayment channels\n\n.\n This is actually quite an old idea. There have been several variations of this, and the Lightning Network just happens to be the best so far.\u201d\n\n\n\nDifferent Types of Payment Channels Within the Same Network\nAlthough there are strong similarities between Amiko Pay and the Lightning Network, Plooy was quick to point out some key differences between the two payment channel networks during his Scaling Bitcoin Montreal presentation. One of Plooy\u2019s first points had to do with Amiko Pay\u2019s ability to offer more flexibility when it comes to the types of payment channels that can be found on the network:\n\n\nThis kind of design makes it possible to have different kinds of channels within the same network, and that opens up a couple of possibilities. One thing is these channels can be different in technology, so they can offer different tradeoffs in terms of security versus convenience.\u201d\nPlooy went on to add:\n\n\nAnother difference is they could actually be running on different blockchains.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe ability to construct a blockchain-agnostic network of payment channels is noteworthy when applied to sidechains. That sort of setup would allow transfers between sidechains to take place instantaneously. Plooy also added that nodes on Amiko Pay could essentially act as a decentralized exchange as different assets could be found on the same network.\n\n\nRipple-Style IOU Channel Already Implemented\nAlthough Amiko Pay is still very much a work-in-progress, a channel prototype already is available. Plooy described this channel during his presentation:\n\n\nWhat has been implemented right now is a \nRipple-style IOU channel that is not a real microtransaction channel. It is just an object that fills in the place of a microtransaction channel and only does some bookkeeping of who owes what. Of course, this gives no protection or security whatsoever, but for software testing it is really useful because it is trivial to implement.\u201d\n\n\nAlthough the currently available channel is essentially used only for software testing right now, Plooy added that it could also be useful for connections between trusted parties in the future.\n\n\nWhat About a True Lightning Channel?\nThe developers behind the Lightning Network currently are working on a sidechain implementation of the concept because the network requires some changes to Bitcoin Core. Plooy decided to take a different approach with his system. He noted, \u201cI don\u2019t want to depend on the Bitcoin developers to give me those new features.\u201d\n\nPlooy described his alternative approach to implementing a lightning channel in Amiko Pay:\n\n\nI designed a different channel type that emulates these missing features with an escrow service, so now you sort of have to depend on the escrow service to correctly evaluate all of the things that are not evaluated by a Bitcoin script.\u201d\n\n\nPlooy has written a white paper, which explains his escrow-based approach in greater detail.\u00a0\n\n\nI think it is actually good enough for real-world usage,\u201d he said.\n\nPlooy closed his talk by discussing a few of the remaining issues with payment channel networks, such as unresolved security holes and economic modeling that could hinder development over the near term. For now, it does not appear that these problems will prevent Amiko Pay or the Lightning Network from existing in the real world.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 12, "day": 2}

Files are protected through a multiple-stage process and encrypted with an algorithm called Twofish.\n\nThe strength of the platform relies on its Reed-Solomon-based file distribution system. All user data is split into several pieces as it enters the Sia client, leaving very few fractures necessary to recover the original data. These pieces of sensitive user information are padded to 4 megabytes, to protect user privacy. Finally, each padded piece is encrypted using unique encryption keys in the client side.\n\nThese security protocols are designed to prevent hackers from seizing user data of the Sia platform in an event of a data breach.\n\n\u201cHosts receive an encrypted blob and are not given any information about where the other pieces of the file are. Even if they found out, they would still have to crack multiple encryption keys to recover the file. Cryptographic checksums are maintained by the client that alert the user to any tampering that the hosts may have attempted,\u201d the Sia team told Bitcoin Magazine \nin an interview.\n\nAccording to the team, the sophisticated encryption and decentralized file distribution system of the Sia platform could be used for decentralized application development. Its API enables developers to store files of the application directly into the Sia client, allowing third-party app users to directly access their customized data storage systems without revisiting the original client.\n\nThe company also announced a partnership with flexible back-end application development platform Crypti to allow its engineers to integrate the Sia API to grant access to its data storage client.\n\n\u201cCrypti has integrated with Sia as a storage layer for their decentralized application development. Sia provides an API that can be used to upload files to the storage network. Crypti is a flexible platform that can integrate with multiple backends, but Sia is the first decentralized offering, allowing developers to build truly trustless Crypti apps,\u201d the Sia team told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nBoth third-party application and the Sia platform users are given the permission to issue smart contracts for file storage. The feature allows an uploader and a host to agree on storage terms including duration of storage, payment scheduling and amount and embed the information onto the blockchain, creating an unalterable contract automatically.\n\n\u201cWhen the contract ends, the host must submit a storage proof to the blockchain, demonstrating that it still has the file specified by the contract. If the proof is valid, the uploader\u2019s money is transferred to the host, and the host\u2019s collateral is returned. But if the host submits an invalid proof, or no proof at all, then all of the money is given to the uploader,\u201d explained the Sia team.\n\n\u201cThe extraordinary parallelism of the Sia network means that upload and download speeds can saturate most connections. The vast array of distributed nodes means that Sia would make an excellent CDN. The erasure coding algorithms over the global network make Sia much more resistant to block swan outages such as power failures and natural disasters. The specifications of the Sia network are superior across the board,\u201d claimed the team.\n\nCurrently, Sia\u2019s cloud storage network is being sold at at $3 per terabyte per month. According to its website, the network is hosting over 1 terabyte at time of publication.\n\nNow that the project has officially launched, the Sia team aims to onboard developers and enterprise customers. As the platform gains traction, the team plans to continue to improve the core Sia protocol and hire talented engineers to improve the platform\u2019s security protocols and user experience.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 12, "day": 2}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin wallet provider GreenAddress was always critical of raising Bitcoin's block-size limit. As one of the first in the space in May of this year, the European multisig-wallet and software company\n publicly\n\n opposed\n\n Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Core developer Gavin Andresen's initial plans to increase the maximum block size.\n\nNow, more than six months later, GreenAddress CEO Lawrence Nahum still holds firm, telling Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cWe are approaching this issue with an open yet conservative mind, and with the idea that first and foremost Bitcoin should be censorship resistant, and thus decentralized to achieve that. In the future it may be possible and healthy to increase the block size without compromising Bitcoin\u2019s decentralization, but we're not convinced solutions such as BIP [Bitcoin Improvement Proposal] 101\n\nfit the bill.\u201d\n\nThe long-lasting block-size dispute, representing a trade-off between the number of transactions\n\nthe Bitcoin network can handle and its\n decentralization, might be entering a decive month. A large segment of Bitcoin's academic and engineering community will discuss this and other issues at the upcoming\n Scaling Bitcoin\n\nworkshop in Hong Kong on the 6th and 7th of December,\n while\n\n several\n\n prominent\n\nBitcoin companies have stated they intend to change their code to allow for bigger blocks this month.\n\nNahum strongly maintains that scaling Bitcoin shouldn't happen at the cost of further centralization.\n\n\nAs the size of the blocks increase so does mining and node centralization,\u201d Nahum argued. \u201cIt is already quite evident in the industry that even Bitcoin companies have been reluctant in running Bitcoin nodes, and as the resource requirements are ever increasing less and less people run nodes. If we were to further accelerate the rate of resource requirements we would soon end up in a situation where people can\u2019t validate transactions and have to rely on a few big companies providing sync services over big data centers \u2013 that\u2019s not very censorship resistant.\u201d\n\nNahum did, however, acknowledge that Bitcoin should scale to allow for more than a handful of transactions per second on Bitcoin's blockchain \u2013 as long as it doesn't hurt Bitcoin's current properties.\n\n\u201cScaling Bitcoin is important, and it is urgent in the sense that the earlier Bitcoin can scale the better it is, and the sooner new use cases can be adopted, such as micro-payments, instant transactions, better privacy, and more,\u201d Nahum explained, emphasizing, \u201c'Scale' being the keyword here.\n\n\nIncreasing the block size is not scaling; it's pivoting Bitcoin from a decentralized currency into a centralized one that can handle more transactions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know how that looks \u2013 see PayPal, Visa, etc. \u2013 and we wouldn\u2019t have adopted Bitcoin if it\u2019s primary function wasn\u2019t censorship resistance.\u201d\n\n\n\nAndresen's latest proposed solution,\n BIP 101,\n was implemented into Bitcoin XT last summer, and is programmed to increase the maximum block size to 8 megabytes if a threshold of 75 percent of mining power accepts the change. Once activated, this limit is set to double every two years for 20 years, ultimately leading to an 8-gigabyte block-size limit. This solution was since endorsed by major industry players, such as\n Coinbase\n,\n Bitstamp,\n Slush Pool\n\n and\n others\n.\n\nNahum, however, maintains that BIP 101 is a bad idea, and disregarded the idea of GreenAddress willfully adopting the proposal.\n\n\nWe think BIP 101 is ill-advised, because it tries to predict the future on wishful thinking in terms of resources, while the simulations provided were insufficient. And perhaps even more important: It doesn\u2019t use consensus to activate, but a mere 75 percent majority. This means it can be activated out of sheer luck, and cause problems with hard fork and consecutive blockchain reorganizations,\u201d Nahum said.\n\nNahum further explained that GreenAddress might support block increase solutions that are more conservative than BIP 101 \u2013 as long as they're not rushed through under pressure just to get things done. The CEO does not think haste is needed, as he believes full blocks are inevitable, and even needed for a healthy fee market to establish on the Bitcoin network.\u00a0\n\nAnd, importantly, Nahum believes that Bitcoin's real scaling solutions should ultimately be built on top of the protocol, as additional layers.\n\n\nWe think Lightning is very promising,\u201d Nahum said. \u201cAt a high level it allows to transfer bitcoin using Bitcoin transactions, but skipping the blockchain until it is actually necessary, effectively compressing or netting the transactions. This provides instant transactions, micro-payments, and scale! We could do thousands of transactions per second without requiring every Bitcoin node to validate and store all these transactions \u2013 which may even improve privacy, too.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto sacks08\n/ Flickr(CC)\n\n\n", "year": 2015, "month": 12, "day": 2}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\n\nBlockchains are set to go mainstream. As opposed to bitcoin \u2013 the currency \u2013 the underlying blockchain technology is embraced by prominent companies, banks, and even governments. A brand new industry is emerging based on this technological advancement that allows multiple entities to agree on a single version of a database with no need for a trusted third party.\n\nHowever, much of this blockchain industry does not actually use Bitcoin's blockchain. Rather, several startups are building various types of blockchains, or shared-ledger technology that uses some of Blockchain's efficiencies. There is a simple reason for this strategy: Bitcoin's architecture is limiting in scope.\n\nHowever, some properties of Bitcoin's blockchain are unmatched; it is, by far, the most secure open and decentralized ledger out there. That's why a new wave of blockchain-startups, including companies such as  Factom,\n Tierion\n\nand\n DocuSign, is now seeking to marry the best of both worlds.\u00a0\n\nThey use Bitcoin as an anchoring technology, used to secure alternative chains and data layers.\n\n\n\nLimitations & Security\n\n\nPeter Kirby is the CEO of Factom, a well-known blockchain startup which is building a data layer on top of Bitcoin, and \nworking on\n\n a land registry program with the Honduran government. Speaking to \nBitcoin Magazine, Kirby explained why it makes sense for companies to avoid using Bitcoin in some cases.\n\n\nYou don't see a lot of really, really advanced stuff being built on Bitcoin, because Bitcoin has some major limitation,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cObviously there's a speed limitation; you need to wait 10 minutes for transactions to confirm, and sometimes you want three, maybe six confirmations. But you don't always have an hour to wait on an application. Additionally, there's a cost issue. If bitcoin's value goes way, way up, it means all your costs change. And finally, the most important one, there is a capacity issue. Bitcoin can't handle more than, like, seven transactions per second.\u201d\n\n\nBut that does not mean Bitcoin's blockchain is useless, Kirby emphasized. One property of Bitcoin's blockchain has been impossible to copy so far: its unique security proposition. Bitcoin's immutability relies on mining power to secure the network against 51 percent attacks. In other words, it uses computing power to stop anyone from \u201cchanging the past.\u201d\n\nAnd, over the last six years, Bitcoin has garnered a record amount of hashing power.\n\n\nBitcoin is an amazing network, and it's got a lot of horsepower; some 500 petahash worth,\u201d Kirby continued. \u201cIf you think of blockchains as a brick-stacking machine, where every time you write something you stack bricks on top of that, Bitcoin stacks the most bricks by 100,000 times. For every brick that another system stacks, Bitcoin stacks a ton.\u201d\n\n\nAnchoring\n\n\nThis unique security proposition has opened the door to a new application of the original Bitcoin blockchain: anchoring. Rather than transmitting and processing all information, some of the newer blockchains and alternative data-layers do most of the work on their own chain or ledger, and simply tap into Bitcoin's security without putting a big footprint into the system.\n\nThis is done using cryptographic tools called Merkle trees. Data \u2013 any type of data \u2013 can be scrambled and compressed into a hash: a seemingly random string of numbers. This hash can be much shorter than the original data, but is also impossible to unscramble, deeming it useless to anyone who doesn't have the original data. But anyone who does\nhave the original data can scramble that data in the exact same manner. If the hash turns out the same, it essentially verifies that the original hash was made using the same data.\u00a0\n\nA Merkle tree, then, consists of multiple hashes hashed together into a new hash, called a Merkle root. As such, hundreds of pieces of data can all be compressed into a Merkle root. And using the magic of cryptography, anyone who has any of the original data can use the Merkle root to check whether that original data is part of the Merkle tree.\n\nMajor companies such as Philips are experimenting\n\nwith Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain using Merkle trees. The electronics and health care giant recently established a partnership with Tierion, a blockchain startup that lets users create a verifiable record of any data, file, or business process on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nElaborating on the specifics of this approach, Tierion CEO Wayne Vaughan told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n\nTierion can anchor millions of records in the blockchain, even though Bitcoin can only handle seven transactions per second. Every 10 minutes we construct a Merkle tree of the recently received records and publish the Merkle root in a Bitcoin transaction. Tierion uses information from this process to create a blockchain receipt for each individual record. Anyone with a blockchain reciept can verify the contents and timestamp of a record, without even needing to know about Tierion. They can just check the Bitcoin blockchain.\u201d\n\n\nExplaining why this might be useful, Vaughan said:\u00a0\n\n\nImagine you're a manufacturer with a complex purchasing process. You can connect your existing procurement systems to Tierion, or one of the other tools that anchors data in the Bitcoin blockchain, to timestamp and verify the contents of each purchase order and approval. This lets you create a verifiable audit trail of a purchasing process that spans multiple partners.\u201d\n\n\nThis strategy is even being adopted by legacy payment systems. Visa recently announced\n\na partnership with DocuSign to publish contracts on Bitcoin's blockchain while using the existing payments rails as provides by Visa itself.\n\n\nIn our DocuSign/Visa connected car example, we\u2019re generating transaction information and posting it to an open system which provides a secure, tamper-proof container which is also time-stamped,\u201d DocuSign founder and Chief Strategy Officer\n \nTom Gonser said. \u201cThis container can then be accessed by any application to pick up our transaction and process it, knowing that it is authentic.\u201d\n\n\nThe future of Bitcoin 2.0\n\n\nThese companies, therefore, believe anchoring could very well be the future of Bitcoin as a 2.0 technology. Bitcoin itself might never be the platform that's used to record every single stock trade, or all the world's data. But it could evolve to be a fundamental and secure base layer, on which more advanced solutions are constructed. Bitcoin is being rediscovered as a building block, much like the IP layer of the internet itself.\n\n\nTCP/IP moves the data packets, HTTP manages images and visualization, and then fancy stuff like Flash and HTML5 get built on top of that,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cWe think that blockchain technology will be built the same way. Bitcoin at the core, and a data layer on top on which you write stuff... fancy applications like Storj and distributed computing like Ethereum on top of that...\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThe world of banking and finance is kind of apprehensive about Bitcoin in general; they're always coming up with reasons why Bitcoin is not perfect. But it doesn't need to be perfect, it just needs to be there.\u201d\n\nVaughan agreed.\n\n\nThe world has never really had something like this before,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Bitcoin blockchain provides a global consensus engine that databases can use to verify information. I think people are just starting to recognize its potential.\n\n", "year": 2015, "month": 12, "day": 2}

Therefore, we think that the Bitcoin protocol should be developed like other Internet protocols \u2013 by a consensus process involving all parties. This process may be lengthy, but it is better than making decisions that don\u2019t consider all points of view.\u201d\n\n\nDecember might be a crucial month for Bitcoin's future, as the block-size dispute \u2013 representing a trade-off between the number of transactions\n\nthe Bitcoin network can handle and its decentralization\n \u2013 might reach a critical juncture. A large segment of Bitcoin's engineering and academic community will discuss the issue of how best to scale Bitcoin at the upcoming workshop in Hong Kong starting this Sunday, while several\n\nprominent\n\nBitcoin\n\ncompanies\n have stated they intend to change their code to allow for bigger blocks shortly afterward.\n\nVavilov agrees that Bitcoin's block-size limit needs to be increased eventually, though he does not consider the situation as urgent as most proponents of a rapid increase do. Moreover, the BitFury CEO does not believe Bitcoin necessarily needs to scale 'on-chain,' as additional layers built on top of Bitcoin's blockchain should eventually be able to take on most of the workload.\n\n\u201cBitcoin's block-size limit needs to be increased in order to achieve wide Bitcoin adoption, but we don't consider this an urgent issue,\u201d Vavilov said. \u201cAs  statistics suggest, the current average block size is a little over 0.5 megabyte \u2013 well below the 1 megabyte block-size limit. We believe that most of transaction throughput would be performed off-chain in the long term using Lightning, sidechains and other scaling technologies. However, even in this case, the blocks sizes need to be increased eventually; the authors of the Lightning white paper estimate the necessary block size for global Bitcoin plus Lightning adoption at more than 100 megabytes per block.\u201d\n\nOne proposed block-size solution designed by former Bitcoin Core lead developer Gavin Andresen, BIP 101, was implemented in Bitcoin XT, the alternative Bitcoin implementation run by Google veteran Mike Hearn. This patch is programmed to increase the maximum block size to 8 megabytes if a threshold of 75 percent of mining power accepts the change. Once activated, this limit is set to double every two years for 20 years, ultimately leading to an 8-gigabyte block-size limit. BIP 101 is favored by several leading Bitcoin companies as well as \nSlush Pool.\n\n\n\nVavilov has no plans to change BitFury's code to allow for bigger blocks through BIP 101, however.\n\n\u201cAs detailed in our white paper\non the subject, we do not support an upgrade to BIP 101,\u201d Vavilov said. \u201cIn our opinion, BIP 101 is not sufficiently tested nor theoretically substantiated. Its introduction could bring radical changes to the topology of the Bitcoin network. Additionally, we think that a more gradual increase of the block-size limit will help develop a transaction fee market. This would be great for the Bitcoin ecosystem from the security point of view.\u201d\n\nOne alternative block-size proposal that has been gathering support is an incremental increase to 8 megabytes in three steps over four years time. Proposed as a temporary solution by Blockstream CEO and hashcash inventor Dr. Adam Back, this \u201c2-4-8\u201d option seems acceptable to a significant segment of the Bitcoin Core development team, as well as prominent industry members.\n\nVavilov indicated this solution could be acceptable, too.\n\n\u201cWe would rather prefer to see a long-term solution,\u201d the BitFury CEO said when asked by Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cIf increasing the block-size limit quickly is really necessary, a temporary solution would do fine, too, provided it would buy enough time to develop a long-term strategy.\u201d\n", "year": 2015, "month": 12, "day": 4}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nThere have been a few proposals to increase the maximum \nblocksize\n in Bitcoin over the past year, but the two plans that are garnering the most attention right now are \nJeff Garzik\u2019s\nBIP 100\n and \nGavin Andresen\u2019s\nBIP 101. While Andresen has already implemented his plan in \nBitcoinXT, Garzik is still working on a formal write-up and the code for BIP 100.\n\n\nAndresen shared his thoughts on BIP 100 via an interview on Epicenter Bitcoin. Although he did not seem completely dismissive of the proposal, it\u2019s clear that he would prefer to go with his own idea for increasing the blocksize, which would offer more predictability in regard to where the blocksize limit will be in the future.\n\nHow BIP 100 Works\n\nWhen asked directly about BIP 100 by Epicenter Bitcoin\nco-host S\u00e9bastien Couture, Andresen was quick to describe the basic way in which the concept is intended to work:\n\n\u201cJeff [Garzik]\u2019s proposal is that basically the miners get to decide what the next maximum blocksize should be. There\u2019s kind of a regular vote every -- on the order of months.\u201d\n\nAndresen then discussed both BIP 100 and BIP 101 in terms of which proposal would lead to a larger increase in the blocksize limit. The Bitcoin Foundation\nchief scientist noted that Garzik\u2019s proposal does not come with an immediate increase after it has been implemented, but this does not necessarily mean that it would limit the size of blocks over the short term:\n\n\n[Garzik] starts with the status quo, so he has no jump-up until the first miner vote. It\u2019s more cautious there. I mean, theoretically, miners could double-up -- he has a maximum of 32 megabyte blocks -- more quickly. So, if miners wanted to and they all voted for the maximum increase every time, we could be at 32 megabytes more quickly than BIP 101, which would probably be OK if the miners are comfortable with that and they think the network can support it, then OK, so be it.\u201d\n\nIs BIP 100 More Conservative?\n\nDue to the unpredictable nature of Garzik\u2019s BIP 100 proposal, it is difficult to tell if the plan would be more or less conservative than Andresen\u2019s BIP 101. Andresen stated:\n\n\nDepending on how you look at it, it\u2019s either less conservative or more conservative. It\u2019s probably more conservative.\u201d\n\nIf BIP 100 were implemented, it would take a vote from the miners to increase the blocksize limit. In other words, BIP 100 does not increase the blocksize limit by default. It\u2019s also possible that miners could limit the blocksize to a size much smaller than Andresen\u2019s proposed immediate increase to 8 megabytes, which is why some individuals see this proposal as a more conservative approach. On the other hand, miners could vote to increase the maximum blocksize to 32MB in a relatively short period. It is difficult to know which approach would be more conservative without seeing how miners would react to a real-world BIP 100 implementation.\n\nBIP 101 is More Predictable\n\nThe key attribute that Andresen likes about his own plan when compared to BIP 100 is that his comes with a predictable increase in the blocksize limit. He explained the importance of this predictability during his Epicenter Bitcoin\ninterview:\n\n\nI don\u2019t like it as much as BIP 101. I don\u2019t really care what the rule is, but I really like predictable rules. I really like rules that are -- I know exactly what the maximum blocksize is going to be on, you know, February 15th, 2022. With BIP 101, we know that. It\u2019s set down there in the spec. We know exactly what it\u2019s going to be, in much the same way that we know what the supply of bitcoin is going to be on that date too -- pretty much. [Bitcoin founder] Satoshi [Nakamoto]\u2019s very predictable \nmoney supply algorithm\n\n for introducing new bitcoins is kind of what inspires me to propose that we just have this limit be very predictable so people can plan... You can do some modeling of what I think the demand for transactions is going to be. You might be able to figure out what the fees are likely to be. All those kinds of things are easier to do if you, kind of, fix this rule as opposed to letting it be miner consensus over time.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe majority of the network hashrate is currently supporting\nGarzik\u2019s BIP 100 solution via a Coinbase\nblocksize vote on the network. Having said that, miners are not the only Bitcoin users with a say in the matter. Many bitcoin exchanges, wallet providers, and payment processors, such as Circle\nand Blockchain.info, see value\nin Andresen\u2019s BIP 101 -- but not necessarily the BitcoinXT fork. Coming to consensus on this matter has proven to be next to impossible up to this point, but it\u2019s possible that we could be approaching a breaking point with all of the recent activity in the debate.\n\nPhoto \nWeb Summit\n\n\n / \nFlickr(CC)\n\n\n\n", "year": 2015, "month": 12, "day": 7}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nJim Burton, the British lead developer of \u201clightweight\u201d Bitcoin client\n MultiBit, favors a rapid block-size increase in order to allow for more transactions on the network, rather than focusing on layers built on top of Bitcoin.\n\n\n\u201cPhilosophically, we think that Satoshi's vision of a peer-to-peer currency needs bigger blocks,\u201d Burton told Bitcoin Magazine. We want people to be able to transact person-to-person 'on-chain'. We are starting to see large transaction backlogs, for instance recently on Black Friday, so the need for bigger blocks is clear.\u201d\n\nThe block-size dispute \u2013 which represents a trade-off between the   number of transactions\n\nthe Bitcoin network can handle and its\n decentralization\n\n\u2013 seems to be reaching decisive weeks. A large segment of Bitcoin's academic and engineering community will discuss the question of how best to scale Bitcoin at the upcoming\n Scaling Bitcoin\n\nworkshop in Hong Kong on the 6th and 7th of this month,\n while\n\n several\n\n prominent\n\nBitcoin companies have stated they intend to change their code to allow for bigger blocks within the next weeks.\n\nBurton acknowledged that bigger blocks might add centralization risk to Bitcoin\u2019s network, but he said he believes these are manageable. Additionally, the MultiBit developer hopes that the Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Hong Kong might help establish solutions for moving forward.\n\n\u201cAs for the cost of running a full node, any company running a Bitcoin-based service will probably want to run at least one Bitcoin Core or XT node to ensure the data they are using is accurate,\u201d Burton said. \u201cAnd while bigger blocks need software engineering to improve propagation, this is the focus of the two 'Scaling Bitcoin' conferences.\n\n\u201cWe will not be attending the conference in Hong Kong ourselves, but will be following the event closely,\u2019 he added. \u201cMost people I have spoken to about the block-size limit want to see action rather than a prolonged debate, so I am hoping we will see a clear path forward in the next couple of months.\u201d\n\nCurrently, there are several proposals and ideas to increase Bitcoin's block-size limit. The solution to increase the block size designed by Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Core developer Gavin Andresen,  BIP 101, was implemented into alternative Bitcoin implementation Bitcoin XT last summer, and is programmed to increase the maximum block size to 8 megabytes if a threshold of 75 percent of mining power accepts the change. Once activated, this limit is set to double every two years for 20 years, ultimately leading to an 8-gigabyte block-size limit.\n\nAnother idea that has been gathering support is  Blockstream\n\nCEO and Hashcash inventor Dr. Adam Back's \u201c2-4-8\u201d quick fix, which would incrementally increase to the limit to 8 megabytes in three steps over four years time.\n\nOther proposals \u2013 both regarding the block-size limit and concerning alternative scaling solutions \u2013 will be discussed in Hong Kong this week as well.\n\nWhile Burton, whose MultiBit was launched more than four years ago, believes the block-size should limit should be increased soon, he did not give a clear preference for the type of solution.\n\n\u201cWe are fortunate that the architecture of both MultiBit Classic and MultiBit HD is agnostic to the block size. Both versions will happily connect to either Bitcoin Core or XT, and should work without change for any of the proposed block sizes,\u201d Burton said. \u201cWe would be very pleased to see BIP 101 implemented, but if the consensus is that increasing it '2-4-8' is a safer procedure we would be happy to see that, too.\u201d\n\nLastly, Burton indicated he is in favor of additional scaling solutions, such as layers built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, as long as the scalability doesn\u2019t solely rely on it.\n\n\u201cAdditional layers on top of Bitcoin such as the  Lightning Network\n\nwill also be needed to scale Bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is not an 'either/or' situation. We can do both.\u201d\n", "year": 2015, "month": 12, "day": 3}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe long-lasting block-size dispute seems to be inching toward a climax.\n\nA large segment of Bitcoin's academic and engineering community has been discussing the possibilities and tradeoffs of scaling Bitcoin at the Scaling Bitcoin\n\nworkshop in Hong Kong this past weekend, while prominent Bitcoin companies such as\n Coinbase,\n BitPay,\n Bitstamp\n\nand\n others\n\nhave posed a \u201cDecember deadline\u201d afterward, at which point they will change their code to allow for bigger blocks.\n\nBut not according to  Ciphrex\n\nCEO and Bitcoin Core developer Eric Lombrozo: \u201cTalk of 'deadlines' is just that: talk. In the end it is not really up to these companies to impose any such deadline.\u201d\n\nAccording Lombrozo, whose Ciphrex is the company behind the Bitcoin wallet \u00a0mSIGNA\n, the block-size dispute represents a clash of visions. And the only way to reconcile these visions to some degree, he thinks, is through added layers on top of the Bitcoin protocol, such as payment channels\n and the Lightning Network.\n\n\n\u201cAt one extreme \u2013 the \u2018big block\u2019 side \u2013 we have a system where anyone can transact but few can verify, and at the other we have a system where anyone can verify but few can transact,\u201d Lombrozo explained. \u201cThe first is not really much different from exisisting centralized payment systems, and the latter is only well-suited for high-value settlement. Neither extreme is desirable. Bitcoin, in its current form, presents us with this fundamental tradeoff. To get the best of both worlds, or something close to it, will require additional technology layers.\u201d\n\n\nThis assesment is not shared by Google veteran Mike Hearn and former Bitcoin Core developer Gavin Andresen. While not opposing additional layers, Hearn and Andresen maintain that Bitcoin should be allowed to scale \u201con-chain,\u201d which is why they implemented \nBIP 101\n\n in Bitcoin XT. BIP 101 is programmed to increase the maximum block size to 8 megabytes if a threshold of 75 percent of mining power accepts the change. Once activated, this limit is set to double every two years for 20 years, ultimately leading to an 8-gigabyte block-size limit.\n\n\n\nLombrozo said he could see himself supporting a block-size limit increase, but only after critical issues with the protocol are fixed to ensure bigger blocks can be rolled out safely. Some of the ideas to do this \u2013 such as the \u201csegregated witness\u201d proposal \u2013 will be presented in Hong Kong over the next couple of days.\n\nThe Ciphrex CEO pointed out that Bitcoin\u2019s base layer technology and basic research and development are underfunded compared to funding on the application level, meaning that improvent has not come as fast as it could have otherwise. But rolling out bigger blocks before proper solutions are implemented is a bad idea, Lombrozo argued.\n\n\u201cContinuing to subsidize transactions while externalizing the costs to the validator nodes that keep Bitcoin secure will not drive greater adoption. What made Bitcoin successful to begin with were the incentives for people to run nodes \u2013 to contribute resources to the network ... not getting a bunch of retailers to 'accept bitcoin.' Externalizing the costs to these nodes is not unlike other industry polluters trying to profit while shirking on the cost of cleanup. And \u2013 importantly \u2013 it actually works against the dynamic that made Bitcoin successful.\n\n\u201cA block-size increase based on political compromise that disregards serious technical concerns sets a terrible precedent. Appeasing certain interests in this manner may encourage others in the future to try the same tactics. That's actually one of my biggest concerns regarding any controversial hard fork proposal: Even if the network survives without losing some of its important characteristics, it could provide an opening for future saboteurs.\u201c\n\nApart from Andresen and Hearn, BIP 101 is supported by several prominent Bitcoin companies, including some that stated they intend to change their code by December, and Bitcoin mining pool Slush Pool. Hearn, moreover, recently\n alleged\n\nthat miners will change their code to allow for bigger blocks as well \u2013 if no solution is agreed upon after Hong Kong.\n\nLombrozo, however, squarely dismissed this notion.\n\n\u201cHearn is known for big talk and bluffs... and misrepresentations,\u201d Lombrozo said. \u201cIf you look at the raw statistics, by any metric, Bitcoin XT deployment has been a dismal failure. \"Barely anyone is mining in favor of Bitcoin XT; far less than one percent of hashing power. Only an estimated 8 percent of all Bitcoin nodes currently run XT, and this figure has been dropping since its peak around August. The sober view is that most miners and companies are not quite ready to risk it all on a fork of Bitcoin that most of the top contributors believe is a bad idea and that has not been extensively reviewed and tested.\u201c\n\nLombrozo, instead, believes that the Bitcoin industry will follow the development community, as he believes that would be the only sensible thing to to.\n\n\u201cWho is going to support a BIP 101 Bitcoin?\u201d Lombrozo asked rhetorically. \u201cWhere is Hearn going to get all the skilled people to contribute? To whom will these miners and companies turn if anything breaks? The overwhelming majority of the top contributors, even in the Bitcoin XT repository, have made it clear they support neither the repository itself nor Hearn's tactics.\u201d\n", "year": 2015, "month": 12, "day": 7}

Unlike Form S-1, which is the comprehensive filing required for companies which plan to hold an initial public offering (IPO) of their stock, the S-3 is for companies that already have achieved a certain level of compliance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Specifically, a company must have at least 12 months of properly filed reports with the SEC to be eligible to file an S-3.\n\nOverstock\u2019s t0 (tee-zero) platform has been working on bringing equity trades and settlement to the blockchain since it was first announced in April 2015. In July, Overstock sold the first cryptobond on the blockchain. As a proof of concept, FNY Managed Accounts agreed to buy the $5 million bond, with assurances in place in case the technology failed.\n\nIn an effort to enter the financial industry, t0 acquired Wall Street brokerage firm SpeedRoute for $30.3 million in August 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s a routing service that is connected to all 11 exchanges and 25 dark pools in the United States, it\u2019s a very significant node within the national market already \u2026 We knew that we wanted to bring the blockchain to Wall Street and rather than build it in isolation and try to get people to adopt it, if we bought a node within the national market system and then built the crypto on top of it so it was all regulatory compliant and speaks the technology of FinTech \u2026 We didn\u2019t want to be a Mt.Gox trying to build something and sneak it past the regulators,\u201d said CEO Patrick Byrne in an interview with the Tabb Forum\n.\n\n\nFor Overstock, though, issuing shares of the company on its platform is a viable proof of concept. Fundamentally, t0 operates with the mentality that \u201cthe trade is\nthe settlement.\u201d In traditional equity trades today, the markets operate on a trade date plus three days (T+3) settlement mechanism in which the exchange of payment and securities can take up to three days to settle. With the blockchain, it can be instantaneous and occur at the same time as the trade.\n\nThe t0 platform is built utilizing colored coin technology, which allows for fractions of bitcoin to be used to track ownership of many assets besides bitcoin. For example, a colored coin could be used as a token to prove that an individual owns shares of Overstock. This technology is built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain and is secured by the distributed public ledger.\n\nJacob Cohen Donnelly is a consultant and journalist in the bitcoin space.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBTCC\n\n Chief Operating Officer Samson Mow indicated that the leading Chinese mining pool and exchange supports an incremental increase of Bitcoin's block-size limit to 8 megabytes in order to buy time for alternative solutions to be developed.\u00a0\n\n\nMoreover, Mow believes the Bitcoin industry might opt to raise Bitcoin's block-size limit even if no consensus is found among the Bitcoin Core development community.\n\n\u201cIf there is no consensus soon, I could see a situation where stakeholders make a decision to implement a small increase,\u201d Mow said. \u201cWithout bigger blocks, a fee market will develop, increasing the cost of transactions, and we believe it\u2019s too soon for that to happen.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, the COO of the prominent Chinese Bitcoin company formerly known as BTCChina, explained that he believes the long-lasting block-size limit debate is more than a debate regarding the specific block-size parameter. Rather, Mow says, there is a deeper issue at play.\n\n\u201cThe core of the issue is actually about what Bitcoin will be,\u201d Mow said. \u201cIf we can answer the question of what we all want Bitcoin to be, then the answer to the question of whether the block size needs to be increased will come naturally. Bitcoin can\u2019t be free (as in zero cost), secure, and decentralized all at once and in perpetuity. An extreme view would be: free, secure, decentralized; pick two.\u201d\n\nGiven this trade-off, and much like Bitcoin's \u201cdecentralists,\u201d Mow considers \u201csecure and decentralized\u201d the most sensible choice in the long term. However, and more closely aligned with proponents of a block-size limit increase, Mow believes that Bitcoin transactions should remain cheap and accessible for now, in order to attract new users. Meanwhile, developers can improve Bitcoin's fee market mechanisms and alternative scalability solutions, such as the\n Lightning Network.\n\n\u201cBeing free and secure is great for getting more people to use Bitcoin and growing the market cap,\u201d Mow said. \u201cAs we don\u2019t have a production-ready solution to scale Bitcoin, we should consider increasing the block size so we can drive adoption in the near term.\u201d\n\nAn incremental increase to 8 megabytes over four years, as proposed by Blockstream\n\nCEO and hashcash inventor Dr. Adam Back, therefore, makes a lot of sense for BTCC. Another favored solution is Bitcoin Core developer Jeff Garzik's\n BIP 100, which allows miners to vote on the block-size limit up until a hard cap of 32 megabytes.\n\n\u201cThe '2-4-8' proposal is a good solution for the short term until we can figure out how to really scale Bitcoin,\u201d Mow explained. \u201cIt will let us move incrementally and measure the results carefully. We will only be able to fully understand the impact on the network by scaling block size incrementally. Alternatively, we think BIP 100 is a good option, too, because it is flexible and allows for increases and decreases of the block size as needed. BIP 100 also makes Bitcoin more decentralized in that it reduces reliance on core developers to make adjustments in accordance with market conditions.\u201d\n\nLastly, BIP 101\n\nis still off the table for BTCC. This proposal, which was implemented in alternative Bitcoin implementation Bitcoin XT last summer, is programmed to increase the maximum block size to 8 megabytes if a threshold of 75 percent of mining power accepts the change. Once activated, this limit is set to double every two years for 20 years, ultimately leading to an 8 gigabyte block-size limit.\n\nWhile prominent industry members such as\n Coinbase,\n Bitstamp\n\n and\n others\n\n have publicly backed BIP 101, BTCC believes it will increase the block-size limit too fast and too uncontrollably.\n\n\n\u201cBTCC will not support BIP 101. It\u2019s simply far too risky to have automatic scaling in the manner proposed,\u201d Mow said. \u201cBIP 101 presumes that its formula for increasing block size is the right one for the next 20 years, which is either incredibly arrogant or incredibly reckless. For me, the key take-away from the talks at Scaling Bitcoin in Montreal is that we really don\u2019t know how the network will perform with larger blocks.\u201d\n\nBTCC was one of the first and is one of the biggest bitcoin exchanges in China, and is available in an increasing number of countries outside of China as well. Additionally, BTCC's mining pool controls some  13 percent\n\nof hashing power on the Bitcoin network, while the company also provides a wallet service.\u00a0\n\nRecently, BTCC launched a new BlockPriority service, which guarantees its customers that their transactions will be included in the first block that the BTCC pool mines.\n\n\u201cBlockPriority was developed to protect our customers from attacks on the network or confirmation delays because blocks are full,\u201d Mow explained. \u201cBut the other reason was to emphasize the block-size issue. Although BlockPriority reduces the impact of the block-size debate on BTCC and our users, we still prefer a block-size increase. Ideally, there would be no need for BlockPriority.\u201d\n", "year": 2015, "month": 12, "day": 10}

The judges are Simon Dixon, Andrew \u201cFlip\u201d Filipowski, Hans Lombardo and Roger Ver.\u00a0\nAs a whole, the South Korean bitcoin ecosystem is relatively small when compared to nearby countries such as China and Hong Kong.\u00a0\n\u201cBitcoin exchange in South Korea is present but is insufficient, bid/ask is very small in quantity yet to deal with large volumes,\u201d said Mike Hwang, CMO of Coin Trade, one of the presenting companies, in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cCoin Trade has [a] plan to launch the global Bitcoin exchange platform service from this January 2016,\u201d Hwang explained.\u00a0\nLike many other wallet/exchange providers, Coin Trade is attempting to create an onramp for those who have yet to own bitcoin, plus provide them with the ability to store their bitcoin in a secure wallet and trade it as they desire.\u00a0\n\u201cIn South Korea, there are two early movers that dominate the ecosystem, and they are Korbit and Coinplug,\u201d Paul Bugge, co-founder of Bitholla, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cKorbit is the most-used exchange, while Coinplug is providing multiple services such as Bitcoin ATMs and selling bitcoin through retail convenience stores. Aside from these two tech companies, the new batch of companies are small pre-seed startups like ourselves.\u201d\nBugge explained that Bitholla is a social networking platform that first launched back in July 2015. \u201cSince that time we have focused more on continued development of the product than pushing for traction,\u201d he explained. \u201cUsing Bitholla you can set your own wallet, receiving payment address, make payment requests and send messages. Bitholla is a proximity service so it shows users nearest to you for convenience of paying people around you.\u201d\nAll bitcoin may need for Korea to adopt it is for it to reach critical mass in other parts of the world.\u00a0\n\u201cKorea is a follower country,\u201d Chris Williams, co-founder of Korean Buddy, told Bitcoin Magazine . \u201cKoreans need to see other countries using bitcoin, or a major company domestically adopt bitcoin or a couple of big celebrity endorsements for the normal person to start using bitcoin.\u201d\u00a0\nHe also explained that the ambiguity of regulation in South Korea could be interfering in adoption.\u00a0\n\u201cIs it legal? How is it going to be taxed? Do businesses need a license to accept it?\u201d Williams said, suggesting this uncertainty could be impeding others from trying the technology.\n\u00a0\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t stopped him from creating a product he believes will help adoption. KoreanBuddy \u201cis a virtual Korean shopping agent service. With this service people will be able to buy anything in Korea with bitcoin. We are a commission-based shopping agent. The shoppers tell us what they want \u2026 and we order and ship the items to them.\u201d\nHe compared his service, which he expects to launch on January 4, to tourist info centers where people go in foreign cities. \u201cWe want to be the [tourist info centers] to all foreigners who want to shop online here in Korea. The Korean online shopping info center.\u201d\nThe market may be small in Korea, but the excitement is intense. Day 1 of Inside Bitcoins had topics that covered bitcoin as an investment, blockchain technology for nontechnical people, and bitcoin trading and analysis.

Several other top banks joined R3 soon thereafter, and five more banks \u2013 ING, BNP Paribas, Wells Fargo, MacQuarie and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce \u2013 joined in November.\n\nR3 is a next-generation global financial services company focused on applications of cryptographic technology and distributed ledger-based protocols within global financial markets. Supported by most of the world\u2019s major banks (with notable exceptions in China) and powered by a team of high-profile experts, R3 is well-positioned to find and deploy ways for blockchain technology to be used in the mainstream banking and financial world.\n\nNow, R3 Head of Research Tim Swanson says that the company\u2019s software team in London is developing an open-sourced, generic blockchain for banks, The Sidney Morning Herald\nreports.\u00a0 \"Many banks feel they can reduce, or eliminate altogether, various\u00a0costs,\u00a0by adopting some sort of common shared ledger and let that proliferate through the industry,\" said Swanson, who is in Sydney this week to address\u00a0the Sydney Blockchain Workshops supported by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.\n\nAt the same time, Swanson is persuaded that banks and financial operators need to see solid results before committing to a relatively new and unproven technology.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt is important not to overhype things, although it is too late on that,\u201d Swanson told The Herald. \u201cAt Sibos [the global payments conference held in Singapore last month], everyone was talking about blockchain. Now, deliveries have to be shown to the world in the next 12 months, or people will walk away thinking this is a load of bumf.\"\u00a0\n\nDesigning the R3 blockchain as open source is a firm decision, but the way in which the new blockchain will operate has not been decided, said Swanson. In particular, it isn\u2019t clear whether the R3 blockchain will be open like the Bitcoin blockchain or a \u201cpermissioned\u201d blockchain where only member banks can verify transactions.\n\nPermissioned blockchains would offer the advantages of digital currencies powered by public blockchains \u2013 fast and cheap transactions permanently recorded in a shared ledger \u2013 without the troublesome openness of the Bitcoin network where anyone can be a node on the network anonymously. Permissioned blockchains for banks and financial operators, supported by Accenture and Digital Asset Holdings CEO Blythe Masters , among others, are being developed by giant Swiss bank UBS , Bitcoin exchange itBit and more.\n\nSwanson said member banks are\u00a0interested in testing the R3 blockchain for a range of applications, including trade financing, processing\u00a0syndicated loans, the settlement and clearing of\u00a0OTC derivatives, and\u00a0marketplace\u00a0lending.\u00a0\n\n\"It's a\u00a0big umbrella,\" he said.\u00a0But, even if the banks want to use the R3 blockchain, it will have to get approved by the regulators first.\n\n\u00a0\"Just because\u00a0you build some tech, it does not\u00a0mean it will be used by financial institutions or will pass\u00a0the smell test of regulators,\" Swanson said. \"If neither of those bodies are\u00a0OK with it,\u00a0it won't be used. The\u00a0best way is to start from scratch,\u00a0and build in\u00a0[regulators']\u00a0specific needs.\n\n\"The regulators I have interacted with in multiple countries have been very open-minded in thinking about how some of this tech might be used,\" Swanson said. \"Most regulators I have spoken to are 'cautiously optimistic'; they want to take a rightfully conservative approach to make sure things are delivered. If we do our job right, what this tech can do is allow regulators to have a window into real-time data, which\u00a0they can read and react to and create policy towards.\u00a0If regulators have a window into what is going on,\u00a0they can get a better idea of preventing systemic risks.\"\u00a0\n\nPhoto Andrew Hart\n/ Flickr (CC)\n\n", "year": 2015, "month": 12, "day": 10}

But approval of this S-3 is in not an immediate sign that Overstock is issuing any securities.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis prospectus provides you with a general description of the security we may offer,\u201d Overstock wrote in its S-3. \u201cEach time we sell securities, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of that offering.\u201d\n\nFurther, while Overstock looked to gain approval to issue up to $500 million in new securities, it cannot be assumed that this is a one-to-one relationship to what the company might look to offer through its t0 platform.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe may decide to offer securities as digital securities, which may pose unique risks to investors in such securities,\u201d Overstock wrote.\n\nAccording to the SEC form, \u201cour digital securities will be issued, available for purchase and traded exclusively on a specific trading system that is registered with the SEC as an alternative trading system, or ATS \u2014 namely, the Pro Securities ATS. Moreover, only customers of the sole broker-dealer that will be licensed to provide access to the Pro Securities ATS digital securities trading platform with respect to Overstock digital securities, which will initially be DriveWealth, will be able to buy and sell our digital securities on the Pro Securities ATS.\u201d\n\nDriveWealth, a broker-dealer based in New Jersey, is a privately held firm founded in 2012. It is an investment platform targeting retail investors around the world.\u00a0\n\nIn its filing, Overstock admitted that by using only the Pro Securities ATS, there would be significant risk for investors. In particular, \u201cit is likely that there will be a limited number of holders of digital securities.\u201d\u00a0\n\nOverstock goes on to say that, \u201cbecause each series of securities offered as digital securities will be their own separate class of securities, distinct from any other securities trading on the NMS [National Market Systems], the Pro Securities ATS is likely to experience limited trading volume...\u201d\n\nOn a national exchange, there are many broker-dealers attached, allowing for the potential for significant liquidity. By operating through the Pro Securities ATS and through only one broker-dealer, there won\u2019t be nearly as many investors trading the offered securities.\n\nOverstock admits that, due to this decrease in volume, that there could be \u201climited liquidity, resulting in a lower or higher price or greater volatility than would be the case with greater liquidity.\u201d The ability to sell an asset in a timely fashion is not guaranteed.\u00a0\n\nTechnology Remains Untested\n\nWhile there are certainly risks with investing in the securities due to volatility and low liquidity, there remain considerable risks due to the technology.\u00a0\n\nThe first has to do with its t0 technology.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOur digital securities will be traded on a novel, untested system developed by the Pro Securities ATS specifically for trading digital securities,\u201d the filing said. Some of the untested risks included regulatory uncertainty, technical flaws with the t0 technology, security breaches of the blockchain and the need for the Pro Securities ATS to halt trades for a period of time necessary to fix flaws.\u00a0\n\nOverstock also revealed the balance between incredible security and creating a system that is usable by the average person. \u201cThe general public, however, is not yet accustomed to using secure cryptographic methods and managing private keys.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAs the saying goes, how can this system be made friendly for Grandma?\n\n\u201cTo make the system more user-friendly, the Pro Securities ATS and DriveWealth are each expected to hold the private keys of digital securities holders. Among other things, this will enable digital securities holders to manage their digital securities account with a simple login and password. If the repository is hacked and private keys are stolen, the thief could transfer affected digital securities to itself and sell the digital securities.\u201d\n\nFundamentally, Overstock reveals one of the pain points many in the Bitcoin space have found. \u201cThe risk of theft of private keys is heightened so long as the centralized repository holds the private keys on behalf of digital security holders, as the thief is able to target a single security system for breach of multiple accounts.\u201d\n\nFundamentally, the primary risks for investors are that this is a new initiative that Overstock is undertaking and is not an equivalent to common stock. Specifically, these shares won\u2019t trade on a \u201cstock exchange\u201d and it is not pegged to any common stock. A share of Overstock on Nasdaq could be valued very differently than a digital security on the Pro Securities ATS.\u00a0\n\nBitcoin Magazine\nwill continue investigating the Overstock Form S-3 filing.\u00a0\n\nJacob Cohen Donnelly is a consultant and journalist in the bitcoin space.

The initiative, designed in collaboration with the payments industry, will enable businesses to receive an enhanced payments service directly from their banks.\n\nScheduled for launch in early 2016, SWIFT\u2019s global payments innovation initiative will initially focus on a business-to-business payments service supported by participating banks, able to support desired features such as same-day use of funds, transparency and predictability of fees, end-to-end payments tracking, and transfer of rich payment information.\n\n\"This global payments innovation initiative is a reflection of the strength of the SWIFT community and its ability to collaborate and innovate, and deliver a new benchmark in cross-border payments,\" said SWIFT Chairman Yawar Shah.\n\nThe global payments innovation initiative will involve the financial technology development community through Innotribe, the innovation arm of Swift. Launched in 2009, Innotribe was created to identify emerging trends in financial services innovation and generate discussions about how these trends could impact the industry going forward. Bringing together innovators, bank representatives, and investors from leading financial institutions, Innotribe has adopted a proactive approach to innovation and fintech.\n\nEarlier this week SWIFT announced\nthat Innotribe will expand its program to support innovation in emerging fintech ecosystems, and expand its Startup Challenge with a new Industry Challenge initiative. In collaboration with SWIFT member institutions and internal teams, participating fintech solution providers will explore potential opportunities for select business areas and work on proofs of concept that might turn into tangible solutions for the industry.\n\n\"Correspondent banking serves the industry with millions of secure cross-border payments day in, day out; with this initiative we are building on those strengths, enabling banks to provide distinctive cross-border payments services and providing real benefits to end customers,\u201d said SWIFT CEO Gottfried Leibbrandt. \u201cThis is a critical step in cross-border payments innovation.\"\u00a0\n\n\"This initiative is an important first step in driving cross-border payments innovation,\u201d said SWIFT Head of Banking Markets Wim Raymaekers. \u201cAs part of the initiative we will continue to develop new and enhanced services, utilizing SWIFT's Innotribe initiative to further engage the FinTech community and explore the application of innovations such as real-time payment status tracking, the use of peer-to-peer messaging and blockchain technology.\"\u00a0\n\nRaymaekers said that the new global payments initiative was phase one of a process, which could eventually \"look at changing correspondent banking settlements and maybe having blockchain technology rather than bilateral correspondent accounts,\" International Business Times\nreports.\u00a0\n\nRaymaekers outlined especially promising applications, for example to cross-border payments, securities, and settlements, as well as SWIFT\u2019s work to develop a strategic blockchain roadmap.\n\nHowever, Raymaekers added that regulatory compliance, identity management and verification are important issues for distributed blockchain systems, which should have built-in business controls and engagement rules. In fact, banks will not adopt a new open technology framework if those control mechanisms are not there.\u00a0\n\n\"It's a great technology, but you still must know who you are transacting with. So there must be identity, there must be some kind of organization around this,\" he said. \u201cTechnology doesn't necessarily change business behavior. Technical measures alone are not enough. We need those business rules.\"\n\nSWIFT, which has been exploring blockchain technology for some time, joins other top financial institutions in realizing that the potential benefits of blockchain technology in the financial industry \u2013 faster and cheaper transactions, permanently recorded in tamper-proof shared ledgers \u2013 are too big to ignore.\u00a0 At the same time, the concerns expressed by Raymaekers indicate that SWIFT could opt for a private, \u201cpermissioned\u201d blockchain.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 12, "day": 11}

Or, in the case of New York, BitLicense has addressed some cryptocurrency regulatory issues, though some claim the New York regulations make sweeping generalities on other virtual currency regulatory issues, leaving them wide open to arbitrary interpretation\n\nby government officials.\n\nHowever, the North Carolina move toward being more explicit in virtual currency regulation is in part thanks to the efforts of the Chamber of Digital Commerce.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolina has taken a leadership role in state-level virtual currency debates and is setting an example to other states to take a more thoughtful and deliberate approach to regulating this nascent industry,\u201d said Perianne Boring, president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce (CDC), in a statement.\n\nThe CDC sought to improve understanding on the emerging digital currency technologies and does not want overregulation to drive out innovation by the grass-roots innovators that often bootstrap their technology on modest budgets.\n\nIn a prepared statement, the CDC offered its opinion on the proposed regulations:\n\nThe North Carolina legislature is considering a bill, at the request of the Commissioner of Banks, that would update the state\u2019s existing Money Transmitter Act to expressly include virtual currency businesses. The Chamber has been actively involved in this process, expressing concern over the proposed legislation\u2019s broad language that could potentially be interpreted to capture certain virtual currency business models that are clearly not engaged in money transmission and should not be regulated as such. The Chamber believes that taking a broad interpretation of money transmission would subject small businesses, start-ups, and technology companies to onerous reporting requirements and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees and bonding requirements.\n\nThe exemptions expressed in the NC MTA offer some of the most unequivocal regulation on how miners, Blockchain 2.0 technology and how other cryptocurrency technology will be regulated in North Carolina. Under the NC MTA, North Carolina miners are not regulated as per the NC MTA FAQ section:\n\n. . . the NC MTA regulates the transmission of virtual currency. It does not regulate the use of virtual currency. A \u201cuser\u201d is someone who uses virtual currency to buy or sell goods and services. A merchant who accepts virtual currency as payment for goods or services is a user and does not require a license. A \u201cminer\u201d is someone who receives virtual currency as payment for verifying transactions, typically by providing computer resources to process data. Once the miner has completed its work, the miner generally becomes a \u201cuser\u201d of virtual currency.\n\nIn contrast, the \nNew York BitLicense\n\ndoes not expressly exempt New York miners from regulation, with one particularly broad statement citing any one of the following activities of \u201ccontrolling, administering, or issuing a Virtual Currency\u201d as falling under New York regulation.\u00a0\n\nUnder this reading, it not only potentially leaves New York miners in limbo, but also Bitcoin 2.0 technologies wishing to be implemented in New York that involve asset or currency issuing technology, such as colored coins and multi-signature technology that involves partial control over virtual currency.\n\nThe NC MTA offers a more direct approach to these issues by expressly generally exempting Bitcoin 2.0 technology and exempting multi-signature software. The NC MTA FAQ section states:\n\n... Blockchain 2.0 technologies refer to the use of the blockchain (or other similar virtual distributed ledger system) to verify ownership or authenticity in a digital capacity. This technology includes such software innovations as colored coins (i.e. coins that are marked specifically to represent a non-fiat-money asset), smart contracts (i.e. agreements implemented on a virtual distributed ledger), and smart property (i.e. property that is titled using a virtual distributed ledger). These uses of the blockchain generally do not involve the use of virtual currency as a medium of exchange. As a result, these software innovations are not regulated by the NC MTA.\n\n... Multi-signature software allows a virtual currency user to distribute authority over his or her virtual currency among multiple different actors. This software requires multiple actors to authorize a virtual currency transaction before the transaction can be consummated. Specifically, a multi-signature provider holds one of two or more private keys needed to authorize transactions. Because the multi-signature provider cannot authorize a transaction alone, this provider is not holding virtual currency on behalf of another, and does not engage in virtual currency transmission by signing transactions on behalf of the user.\n\nAlso, the NC MTA explicitly states that it will generally regulate wallet providers:\n\n... A hosted, custodial wallet provider is in the business of storing a user\u2019s virtual currency on a remote computer until such time as the user desires to spend or exchange the user\u2019s virtual currency. The hosted wallet provider typically agrees to safeguard the user\u2019s private keys and make them available at some later date. This custodial function is regulated under the NC MTA.\u00a0\n\nIn contrast, a non-hosted, non-custodial wallet is typically outside the scope of the NC MTA. A non-hosted wallet is a piece of software deployed on the user\u2019s own computer or device that makes the user\u2019s private keys easier to use by the user. In a non-hosted, non-custodial model, the software provider never gains access to the user\u2019s private keys and does not agree to transmit the user\u2019s virtual currency at a later time. \u00a0\n\nFor many, the NC MTA serves not only to provide guidance to the virtual currency industry in North Carolina, but also to the greater virtual currency ecosystem in the United States.\n\nPhoto\u00a0Jayron32\n/ Creative Commons\n", "year": 2015, "month": 12, "day": 10}

Newhart then used the same bitcoin address and QR code to see if anyone would try to steal the money generated from the Bitcoin research campaign in the streets of Chicago.\n\nDuring the second phase of the experiment, Newhart\u2019s team printed a QR code of the private key corresponding to the bitcoin address and included the word \u201cSHA-256\u201d on the bottom of the shirt, as a reference to the hashing algorithm used for bitcoin.\u00a0\n\nIn less than five minutes of wearing the shirt in the suburbs of Chicago, Newhart received an automated text notification that the bitcoin address used for Bitcoin research campaign was emptied. Some individual used a mobile phone to import the private key printed on Newhart\u2019s shirt and used it to transfer the funds to a personal account.\n\n\"While the first part of our experiment showed that people can be generous, phase two proved that Bitcoin thieves can be lurking anywhere,\" said Newhart.\u00a0\n\nNewhart and his team then devised this experiment to explore the vulnerability of bitcoin wallets and the awareness of the digital currency.\n\n\"A recruiting client, the CEO of a financial services company, had previously had some personal bitcoins stolen when he left his private key in plain view in the back seat of his Mercedes when he had it valet parked.

Microsoft said four large global financial institutions had already signed up to the service.\u00a0\n\"Working with our customers that wanted to start playing around with blockchain technology, the major pain point that we kept hearing from them was that it was just too hard to get started, and too expensive,\" said Microsoft\u2019s Marley Gray, director of tech strategy for financial services.\nGray added that the technology would allow companies to create their own private blockchains, or so-called \"smart contracts\" that automatically execute the terms of an agreement, in 20 minutes, even with no prior experience. Gray also confirmed the ongoing shift of Microsoft\u2019s strategy to the cloud.\u00a0\n\"We bet the entire farm on the cloud, pretty much,\" he said.

Avalon has announced a new A3218 mining chip that will be released in the Avalon6 miner.\n\nAccording to Avalon, each server can process 3.65 TH/s at a power efficiency of 0.29 W/GH. Each server is composed of 80 of the Avalon A3218 chips. The system requires, at minimum, a 12VC DC, 1,100 watts PSU output. Unlike the other companies that have been developing 14nm chips, Avalon decided to stick with its 28nm ASIC chip.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat I can tell you is that Avalon was offered the 14nm Samsung chip many months ago, and they declined,\u201d explained Sean Walsh, Founder of BlockC, in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine . \u201cThe 14nm process node is very new, very slow to design/produce, very difficult, very expensive and doesn't currently yield efficiency gains that even come close to compensating for all this. Avalon will produce at smaller process nodes, but only once it actually makes financial sense to do so.\u201d\n\nCanaan-Creative, the parent company of Avalon, and BlockC have recently announced a partnership that results in BlockC becoming the global distributor (except in China) of all Avalon products and services in the bitcoin space.\u00a0\nAccording to Walsh, 1 petahash of processing power would cost approximately $350,000 to $360,000.\nThis is quite a bit cheaper than the only other seller on the market, Bitmain, for two reasons,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cFirst, Bitmain is currently advertising prices of about $380,000 per petahash. Second, Bitmain is not shipping any miners until mid-December, which is a full month later than BlockC.co ship dates. One Petahash currently earns about $90,000 per month in gross profit (after paying electric bills). Running the numbers, BlockC/Avalon is about 7 percent lower on sales price, plus the 25 percent you gain by emerging your PH a month sooner. That\u2019s an effective savings of over 30 percent.\u201d\nBlockC expects the first batch of Avalon6 miners to arrive in their California datacenters by November 12, 2015. It is currently selling the servers in batches of 10, providing 36.5 TH/s for $14,950.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWho is Avalon?\n\nAvalon is one of the oldest bitcoin mining hardware companies in the ecosystem. Canaan Creative, the parent company of Avalon, was founded in 2012 by NG Zhang, Jiaxuan Li, who goes by the name Lee, and Xiangfu Liu. The first miner they released was the Icarus, which was a programmable Xylinx FPGA chip released in the beginning of 2012. Soon after, they released the Lancelot, which was also based on the Xylinx FPGA.\u00a0\nHowever, Avalon is best know for releasing the first Bitcoin ASIC miner. In October 2012, NG and Lee began working on Avalon 1, which was a 110nm ASIC chip. Less than a year later, the miner was released, ushering in an era of high-powered, specialty bitcoin miners.\u00a0\nThey faced some backlash during 2013 due to some production delays, coupled with some probably overly optimistic claims that Yifu [Guo] had made to the public,\u201d Walsh explained. Yifu Guo agreed to do sales and marketing for NG and left in 2013. \u201cHowever, they resolved the issues, and refunded many tens of thousands of bitcoins to customers. I believe all customers were compensated generously.\u201d\nThroughout its history, Avalon has released five generations of Bitcoin ASIC chips: 110nm, 55nm, 40nm, and now two 28nm designs. The A3218 is its latest generation.\u00a0\nWhile Avalon has kept a low profile for the past few years, Walsh explained that the company is planning to expand beyond just mining. They recently closed a large series A of venture capital financing, which the company will use for acquisitions and organic growth initiatives.\u00a0\nAvalon was (and still is to a large extent) 100 percent devoted to open source software and hardware, as well as the global mainstream adoption of Bitcoin,\u201d Walsh said.\nWith so many other firms taking their bitcoin miners in-house and not selling to the general public, an additional competitor in the public-mining space could bring about continuous development in new, more advanced chips.\u00a0\nJacob Donnelly is a full-time product manager and freelance journalist covering stocks, business and bitcoin.

Before the days of MP3 and P2P file sharing, you didn\u2019t have the ability to hear songs whenever you wished unless you bought them.\nToday one does not even need to download songs, as platforms such as VEVO and YouTube host many of the most popular songs of yesterday and today.\u00a0\nThe industry was faced with a definitive problem in an age of liberal copy and distribution technology: finding new ways to monetize digital music files that lacked scarcity.\u00a0\nA gang of computer programmers \u2013 united by the Bitcoin technology \u2013 are trying to revolutionize an industry after 15 years of disruption which began with Napster and was cemented by BitTorrent.\u00a0\nBitcoin\u2019s blockchain \u2013 a decentralized system powered by a network of computers \u2013 serves as the transparent backbone of the Bitcoin network. The blockchain, which functions as a public ledger, maintains the accounting of the Bitcoin network, timestamping each transaction and assigning a unique ID.\u00a0\nNumerous individuals and companies are excited about the future of the blockchain and the music industry. Three companies, PeerTracks, Bittunes and Ujo Music, each claim their business model will liberate musicians from being under the thumbs of overbearing music labels and streaming services.\u00a0\nPeertracks, strives to use the blockchain technology to develop an artist equity trading system. Bittunes, strives to create an independent music market. Ujo Music, seeks to design a system to fix global royalty distribution and licensing problems faced by the industry.\u00a0\nThese entrepreneurs believe that in the future when an artist creates a song it will be stored on the blockchain with its own unique ID, just like bitcoin is today.\nThe music industry has attempted to solve some of these problems before. But projects such as the Global Repertoire Database (GRD) never came to be. Still, the music industry has needed a new revenue and business model in the wake of Napster and peer-to-peer file sharing.\u00a0\nPeertracks strives to become the perfect music streaming and retail platform that propels peer-to-peer discovery. Peertracks depends on the creation of \u201cartist tokens,\u201d a sort of Bitcoin alternative, the value of which depends on the popularity of the artist who created the coin. As in basic economics, the higher the demand, the higher the worth of the artist token. The less demand, the lower the worth.\u00a0\n\u201cOur goal is to enable new ways of monetizing music and not be forced to rely so much on royalties coming from the sales of nonscarce digital files,\u201d Peertracks CEO, Cedric \nCobban, tells Bitcoin Magazine\n.\u00a0\nPeertracks introduced MUSE at the Fair Music Public Forum,\nheld by Berklee\u2019s Rethink Music on October 2 in Boston. The MUSE blockchain purports to be an open, global ledger, specifically engineered and tailored for the music industry. MUSE seeks to not only manage copyrights but also the payment mechanism itself.\u00a0\n\u201cNo need for legacy banking to pay out royalties earned from music streams/sales,\u201d\u00a0 \nCobban \nsays. The system revolves around Muse_USD, \u201ca cryptocurrency that tracks the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar.\u201d\nMUSE will also allow artists to create their own \u201cNotes\u201d \u2013 a limited edition, cryptographic token that acts like a VIP pass into the artist\u2019s career. Notes initially allow artists to crowdfund and know who their most engaged fans are.\u00a0\n\u201cFor the artist, there is great value in knowing who exactly is supporting him financially and enabling him to continue making a living from music,\u201d Cobban \nsaid.\u00a0\nMUSE isn\u2019t the only such project. Bittunes seeks to use peer-to-peer file-sharing technology with the latest technology in digital payment systems \u201cto radically change the way the technology has been applied so that ordinary people actually earn money by becoming the new distribution channel for digital music,\u201d Bittunes managing director Simon Edhouse told Bitcoin Magazine\n.\n\n\u201cIn this way, Bittunes deals directly with the music piracy problem, with a carrot not a stick, rewarding artists fairly, and allowing users to potentially earn 5-to-10-times profits on song purchases,\u201d Edhouse said. \u201cTo achieve this will not be easy, but the end result could be nothing short of revolutionary.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nThen there is Ujo, a proposed new shared infrastructure for the creative industries that aims to return more value to content creators and their customers. Built in collaboration with the Grammy-winning artist Imogen Heap, Ujo was released last month, and is headed by Phil Barry, who led a team advising Thom Yorke on his BitTorrent strategy for his solo album, Tomorrow\u2019s Modern Boxes. \nBarry also advised Radiohead on its digital strategy for the band\u2019s ninth studio album. \u00a0\nUjo\u2019s model is different, focusing on creating an open-source rights database and payment infrastructure. Ujo, like Peertracks, wants to revolutionize how money is distributed to artists and rights holders.\u00a0\n\u201cOur open platform uses blockchain technology to create a transparent and decentralised database of rights and rights owners, and automates royalty payments using smart contracts and cryptocurrency,\u201d said Phil Barry, founding partner at Edmund Hart, which oversees Ujo. \u201cWe hope that it will be the foundation upon which a new more transparent, more efficient and more profitable music ecosystem can be built.\u201d\u00a0\nFor Barry, the heart of the music industry is the content creators.\u00a0\n\u201cThe most important participants in the music industry are artists and writers,\u201d Barry says. \u201cThey create the raw material upon which everybody else is dependent.\u201d He acknowledges the music industry is 15 years into a major transformation and disruption.\u00a0\n\u201cThe pattern that I see emerging is that the purpose of a record company is becoming increasingly focused,\u201d Barry said. \u201cMajor music companies no longer add value through ownership of chains of record stores or manufacturing plants, but they still finance and market the majority of hit records.\u201d\u00a0\nBarry believes this will change over time.\u00a0\n\u201cI think we will see a big reduction in the share of revenue record labels command as compared with artists and writers,\u201d Barry said. \u201cHanding over copyrights will become increasingly rare.\u201d\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s more, he believes the industry is watching the changes.\u00a0\n\u201cMany companies and performing rights organizations share a really quite bold vision of what the future might look like if blockchain is widely adopted,\u201d he said. \u201cI think everybody can see that sooner or later blockchain is going to bring about change in not just music but all creative industries.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nTherefore, players in the creative industries have a duty to understand the technology.\u00a0\n\u201cNobody wants to repeat the mistakes of the Napster era,\u201d he said.\u00a0\n", "year": 2015, "month": 11, "day": 13}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nWhile opinions on Bitcoin's future differ, most agree that the current scalability debate has become a mess. Trolling, misinformation, populism, vote manipulation, vocal minorities, censorship and other distractions have made it \nhard to find a signal above the noise.\n\nAnd importantly, if protocol development is going to be driven by what seems like \u00a0popular opinion on message boards, this could potentially ruin the whole Bitcoin project.\n\nThe essence of this problem, Yale researcher and\n \nTruthcoin\n\n Chief Scientist Paul Sztorc argues, is that \u201ctalk\u201d does not scale.\n\n\u201cThe real function of a debate is for people to examine each others' reasoning, and find some area of agreement, or maybe highlight areas where they don't agree,\u201d Sztorc told \nBitcoin Magazine.\n\n\u201cBut debates do not scale,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's literally O(n^2) scaling: With five people, you need at least 10 conversations in order to know that everyone is on the same page \u2026 with 50 people, you need at least 1,225 connections. If someone changes their mind or learns something new, that\u2019s all reset. So it\u2019s no surprise \u2013 to me \u2013 that the conversation is becoming socially dysfunctional at around this time.\u201d\n\nLuckily, Sztorc believes there is a solution for this problem: prediction markets.\n\nPrediction Markets\n\nThe concept of prediction markets is not new, Bitcoin legend \nHal Finney\n\n advocated them\n \nyears ago.\n\nBasically, prediction markets are markets for so-called \u201cevent derivatives,\u201d which represent a possible future event. \u201cHillary Clinton will be elected president of the United States in 2016\u201d could be such an event, for example. The relevant derivative might then be redeemable for one dollar if Hillary Clinton is indeed elected, but will be worthless if she is not elected. Up until the election, this derivative will be tradeable on the prediction market. As such, it will command a market price.\n\nIt then holds that this price would reflect the likelihood of Clinton becoming the next president, according to the market. If the Clinton token is worth 40 cents, the market gives her a 40 percent chance of winning the election. After all, if market participants expected a higher chance of her winning, they would buy these derivatives \u201cat a bargain,\u201d and the exchange rate would go up. And if market participants would expect a lower chance of her winning, they would sell (or short) these \u201cexpensive\u201d derivatives, and the price would go down.\n\n\u201cThe great thing about markets,\u201d Sztorc explained, \u201cis that they are incredibly decentralized \u2013 anyone can partake. This is good because, by definition, you don\u2019t know who has what information, and people won\u2019t want to give valuable info away for free. At the same time, markets present information that is unanimously and constantly acceptable. If you have a room full of 5,000 people, those who agree with the current rate would just do nothing. The price is \u2018good enough,\u2019 as far as they are concerned. Yet \nany \nperson with a strong enough conviction can edit the price by buying or selling the event derivative, and update the exchange rate. They can improve the forecast and make money at the same time.\u201d\n\nThe Great Noise Filter\n\nFurthermore, prediction markets could be a great filter for uninformed opinion, or \u201cnoise.\u201d Unlike message boards, chat rooms and mailing lists, partaking in a prediction market would come at a cost. Sztorc, therefore, expects that people who didn't invest the time and effort to really, deeply understand an issue won't get involved at all, as they would be unwilling to invest money, too.\n\n\nTalk is cheap,\u201d Sztorc argued. \u201cBut people who really don't know anything, or know how complicated a situation is, will probably not want to put their money down. And even if they do, even if a fool pushes the price around, there is now money to be made by well-informed people who can pull the market back toward realistic expectations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe same is true for manipulation,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone wants more money, while only a few people will want to knock a market in a certain direction. As such, markets inherently resist dishonesty. Unlike anything else, there is a force pulling the market rate towards reality. They just plain do a good job of getting the right answer, over time.\u201d\n\nJoint probability\n\nPrediction markets can show us the expected future. But, much better, they can also be used to compare multiple expected futures.\n\nThrough\n \nfunky constructions,\n it's possible to make predictions about specific scenarios. For instance: \u201cIf Hillary Clinton is the next president of the United States, then the stock market will rise.\u201d Now, if\n Clinton is \nnot\n elected president, anyone who bet on that scenario will get their money back, regardless of what the stock market does. It's only \nif\n she is elected, that the stock market comes into play. If Clinton is elected and the stock market then indeed rises, whomever predicted that correctly wins money. But if Clinton is elected and the stock market drops, they will lose money.\n\nThis also means that market participants can insure themselves against future events. Someone who holds stocks can insure himself against \u2013 say \u2013 a Donald Trump presidency, by betting that the stock market will drop if Trump wins. The bettor might still lose money on the stock market, but win money on the prediction market at the same time, canceling out his losses.\n\nAnd, of course, these market rates will also be public for anyone to see. So now, prediction markets are not just predicting possible events, but consequences of possible events. While\n \na\nll\n presidential candidates will probably claim that the stock market will rise if they are elected, prediction markets reveal who the market believes is right. Rather than empty promises, voters can base their vote on market information.\n\nBitcoin Governance\n\nSo how is any of this relevant for Bitcoin's governance process?\n\nLet\u2019s take the block-size dispute as an example, and assume that everyone wants the exchange rate to go up. (Note that this is not necessarily true; some people value Bitcoin for other properties than its price. However, even then, the expected price could inform specific aspects of the debate, such as\n \nthe security offered by the value of the mining reward.)\u200b\n\nFirst, a prediction market regarding bitcoin's price as resulting from the block-size limit could be utilized as a \n\u201chard fork insurance.\u201d\n Lets say, for instance, that someone named Greg believes that bitcoin's exchange rate will drop if the block-size limit is increased. Greg doesn't want the bitcoin exchange rate to drop, because he holds a bunch of bitcoin. Therefore, Greg bets that \nif \nthe block size is increased, the exchange rate will drop. If the block-size limit is then indeed increased, and the exchange rate indeed drops, Greg will win money. He would have effectively insured himself against that scenario.\n\nThat would be an advantage for Greg personally, as he wouldn't risk losing money. But it would also help the rest of us. After all, by making the trade, Greg has effectively stated his opinion, which is reflected in the exchange rate. Moreover, Greg could tell other people to insure themselves, or simply make his own insurance public. If people trust Greg's expertise enough, they will follow his lead, which adjusts the exchange rate even further.\n\nBut Greg is not the only one betting. Someone named Mike, who believes the exchange rate will rise if the block-size limit is increased, might be betting as well. And people who trust Mike's expertise might follow his lead instead. Now the prediction market reflects a potentially terrific aggregate of expertise, and their expectations of what's best for Bitcoin, offering a great guide for Bitcoin's development.\n\nAnd there's an additional bonus. Lets imagine that Greg and Mike are talented programmers, working to improve Bitcoin or the ecosystem. Thanks to the prediction market, neither Greg nor Mike need to repeatedly enter into debates on message boards convincing everyone and their grandmother that increasing the block-size limit is either bad or good. After all, they have already insured themselves, and stated their opinion through their trade. Instead of wasting their time on Reddit, they can both get back to work.\n\nNo silver bullet\n\nOf course, a prediction market won't solve Bitcoin's governance problem in and of itself. First, since Sztorc's Truthcoin is designed as a Bitcoin sidechain, there is one prediction that it can\u2019t support. If Bitcoin breaks completely, or its exchange rate goes to zero, no payout will be possible, even if predicted correctly. Additionally, Sztorc's proposal relies on \u201c\noracles\u201d\n to insert the truth after an event has happened, which required a bit of trust in these oracles. (Sztorc believes we should be able to find enough reliable people to do this task, to tide us over until his larger \u201ctrustless orcale\u201d project is completed.)\n\nBut, most importantly, prediction markets cannot govern Bitcoin in and of themselves. They can only advise \u2013 and maybe that\u2019s for the best.\n\n\n\nPrediction markets don't need to replace anything. You can still have your mailing list, you can still have your forum discussions, and prediction markets won't automatically change Bitcoin's code,\u201d Sztorc emphasized. \u201cBut prediction markets do offer something called common knowledge. Everyone will know what the market expects to happen \n\u2013\n and everyone will know that everyone knows. And how weird would it be if the prediction market says we'll see a huge exchange rate collapse if we either do or don\u2019t fork to Bitcoin XT, and yet some developers still keep fighting or pushing it?\u201d\n\n\nFor more information on Truthcoin, visit\n truthcoin.info\n", "year": 2015, "month": 11, "day": 12}

Rather, the company said that it would leverage the colored coin protocol Open Assets, which works on the original Bitcoin blockchain. In June, Nasdaq partnered with San Francisco-based bitcoin API startup Chain to implement the Bitcoin blockchain technology.\u00a0\nNasdaq is scheduled to launch the pilot project operationally later this year, helping companies keep track of the shares they issue and enabling them to almost instantaneously settle transactions, Nasdaq Co-President Hans-Ole Jochumsen, said in an interview reported by Reuters.\n\nJochumsen added that Nasdaq is planning to develop several blockchain applications through its operations in Estonia. Nasdaq owns the Tallinn Stock Exchange, Estonia's only regulated secondary securities market, as well as the Estonian Central Securities Depository (ECSD).\n\nThe ECSD administers share registers for all joint stock companies operating in Estonia, as well as all securities and pension accounts opened in the country and other electronic securities, such as private company shares, bonds and securities transactions histories. The ECSD also provides clearing and settlement services for securities trading, payments of corporate dividends and interest, and other securities-related services.\n\"[Estonia is] a smaller country, so it's not very complex in size, and there is a government that is very keen to use technology,\u201d said Jochumsen. \u201cThey claim that they are in the forefront of using technology in the public center worldwide.\"\nEstonia is, indeed, a leader in deploying advanced communication technologies in the administration and public services sectors.\u00a0 In 2014, Estonia invited anyone, anywhere, to become an e-citizen of the Estonian digital society, open a bank account in Estonia, or start a business. The Estonian e-Residency program, launched on December 1, 2014, is an innovative and potentially disruptive initiative that enables anyone with an Internet connection to establish a financial base in Estonia, with no need of being physically present.\nBanks and startups in Estonia are developing financial service applications based on the blockchain, which use the same technology \u2013 colored coins on the Bitcoin blockchain \u2013 selected by Nasdaq, and could be related to Nasdaq\u2019s initiatives in Estonia.\nIn particular, LHV Bank is developing CUBER (Cryptographic Universal Blockchain Entered Receivables), a new kind of certificate of deposit designed to be used to store or generate value, transfer value, manage liquidity and automate transactions between machines, which can be used as a building block for innovative financial products, Finextra\nreported in June. LHV claims it is the first bank in the world to experiment with real programmable money, issuing receivables in the form of colored coins.\nIn parallel, LHV Bank set up fintech technology startup Cuber Technology, which together with Swedish \u201cblockchain 2.0\u201d company ChromaWay is developing the IOS and Android app Cuber Wallet for fast, free, peer-to-peer (P2P) mobile fiat currency payment.\nBoth CUBER and Cuber Wallet are built on top of open colored coins technological standard and at the moment use the bitcoin blockchain as a database.\n\u201cThe potential of CUBER is huge \u2013 think telecommunication industry developments last 20 years,\u201d said Rain L\u00f5hmus, CEO of Cuber Technology. \u201cHow many new cool applications we are daily using have come out from Development Departments of telecom companies.

In the coinbase parameter, there was a simple message: \u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\u201d From that one block, Bitcoin was born.\u00a0\nBitcoin has come a long way from that initial statement by Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. The technology is growing up and changing from its early days as a project adopted by impassioned technologists and libertarians to a technology widely researched and used by financial institutions worldwide.\u00a0\nBitcoin had a rough road ahead of it, as did many early technologies including the Internet. It dealt with newspaper headlines lambasting Bitcoin because of its connection to Silk Road and drugs. Early adopters suffered millions of dollars in losses when early exchange Mt.Gox imploded. \u201cBitcoin is Dead,\u201d many prophesied.\u00a0\nAnd yet, as Bitcoin approaches its seventh birthday, we see things changing. It is turning into that curious, wide-eyed technology with ideas as widespread as any normal 7-year-old. Cross-border payments, machine-to-machine transactions, smart contracts, microtransactions, and stock settlements all have been discussed and developed. Nothing is off limits; no question goes unasked.\u00a0\nFrom the early days of mining using a laptop computer, now bitcoin miners are setting up industrial-sized data centers with hundreds of thousands of high-powered, specialized machines. In January 2014, the Bitcoin network hashrate was only 10 million GH/s. Now it is 504 million GH/s. And as new mining machines are built and sold, the hashrate has continued to increase. During same time frame, there were around 50,000 bitcoin transactions daily. That measure of network utility has increased to about 170,000 bitcoin transactions daily.\nA big part of this growth in transactions is linked to the growth in bitcoin-accepting merchants. In mid-2014, there were approximately 65,000 merchants who accepted bitcoin. By mid-year 2015, there were 100,000, which is a 50 percent increase. TigerDirect, a publicly-traded online electronics retailer, has seen incredible results. Of all the buyers that used bitcoin, 46 percent of them were brand new to TigerDirect. Further, orders placed with bitcoin were 30 percent bigger. In August 2015, BitPay, a bitcoin payment processor, recorded an all-time high of 70,000 bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin as a tool of transaction is growing.\u00a0\nBitcoin as an asset class is also maturing. For the majority of 2015, the price has stayed relatively nonvolatile and constant, with the price fluctuating from $200 to $300. It\u2019s only the past few weeks where the price has experienced such a significant increase, reminiscent of the early years. From January 1, 2013 to January 1, 2014, the price went from $13.41 to $808.05, going as high as $1,147.25 on December 4. Just one month earlier, on November 4, 2013, the price was $225.20. Even the \u201cbubbles\u201d in bitcoin are maturing. On the other hand, the market cap of bitcoin is down from an all-time high of nearly $14 billion to around $5 billion at time of writing.\u00a0\nVenture capital funding, however, continues to pour into the space. In 2013, bitcoin companies raised only $93.8 million. In 2014, firms raised $314.7 million. With another two months remaining in the current year, bitcoin and blockchain companies have raised more than $1 billion.\n\u00a0\n\nRegulations are also changing. Before, there were politicians decrying bitcoin because of its use on the underground marketplace Silk Road. Now, organizations such as Coin Center and the Chamber of Digital Commerce work to help these politicians and regulators draft rules that will ensure Bitcoin can continue to grow worldwide. New York has led the regulatory charge with its recent BitLicense. The European Union also recently ruled that Bitcoin was not subject to VAT, giving significant clarity for those participating in the ecosystem.\u00a0\nFinally, the next stage of blockchain companies continues to grow. Augur, a decentralized prediction market, announced that it had raised $5.1 million in a crowdsale. Ethereum, the smart contract and publishing platform, raised $18.4 million in its own crowdsale. It is expected that OpenBazaar, the completely decentralized peer-to-peer ecommerce site will launch in the coming months.\u00a0\nIn the graphic below, many of the top Bitcoin leaders talk about the growth of bitcoin and where it is going. Bitcoin is not just in the fringes anymore; it is everywhere. Whether it's miners or payment processors, wallets or developer tools, the reality is simple: Bitcoin is growing up. And its ambitions are as vast as the many great technologies that came before it.\u00a0\n\n\n\nJacob Donnelly is a full-time product manager and freelance journalist covering stocks, business and bitcoin.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\n\nBitcoin is designed as a peer-to-peer network, where nodes randomly connect to other nodes. Transactions and blocks are transmitted over this network by these nodes, until each node receives all the latest transactions and blocks. This works quite well, as the distributed model makes Bitcoin relatively censorship-resistant; there is no central point of control to shut down or pressure into compliance.\nBut there are other, more centralized alternatives for transmitting transaction data, too. The best known of these is \u201cthe\u201d  relay network, introduced in\n 2014\n\nand\n maintained\n\nby Bitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo: \u201cIt's centralizing, but, hopefully, democratizing.\u201d\n\nOn propagation\n\nCorallo's relay network serves two distinct purposes. First, it adds diversity to Bitcoin. Rather than just needing to rely on the peer-to-peer network, Bitcoin users can opt to receive transaction data and blocks through an alternative channel. This makes it harder to successfully attack the Bitcoin network; the relay network functions as a fallback. But the second, and more important reason, is a potential decrease of network latency.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Corallo explained:\n\n\nThe peer-to-peer code in Bitcoin Core is pretty gnarly. It's stable and it works, but it's not very efficient, and it's not very fast. The resulting network latency is a problem, especially for miners. It can sometimes take 10, 15 seconds before they receive newly mined blocks. If you're a miner, 10 seconds is like 1.5 percent loss in revenue. That is potentially a big deal. You don't want that.\u201d\n\nSome of the bigger miners (typically mining pools) have therefore come up with an alternative solution. Rather than using the peer-to-peer network to transmit new blocks, they have created an alternative \u2013 private \u2013 network. If one of these miners finds a new block, that miner immediately sends it over to the other miners on their private network, meaning all these miners can start mining on the new block immediately.\n\nThe problem, of course, is that this disadvantages all miners not\nusing this private network. When a select group of miners starts mining on a new block faster than other miners this select group gets a head start every time one of them finds a block. This is especially worrisome because it is typically the bigger miners who have the time and resources to set up private networks. Smaller miners might, therefore, become less profitable and eventually drop off the network entirely, which centralizes mining even further.\n\n\n\nA Leg Up\n\nCorallo's relay network is essentially a hub-and-spoke network, which consists of servers set up in eight well-connected Internet traffic hubs: New York, Seattle, Amsterdam, Beijing, Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong and Novosibirsk (located in central Russia). Additionally, the relay network uses a fairly basic compression algorithm. Any Bitcoin node can connect to the nearest hub on Corallo's relay network, and send and receive transactions and blocks to and from other connected nodes.\n\nBut unlike Bitcoin's original peer-to-peer network, Corallo's relay network is centrally controlled: by Corallo. This means that users of the network need to rely on Corallo, most importantly for maintenance. (Though this doesn't stop the peer-to-peer network from propagating transactions and blocks in the mean time, of course.)\n\n\nThe relay network is not the most reliable thing,\u201d Corallo acknowledged. \u201cThere is no service-level agreement ... once in a while servers go down and I don't fix it right away... sometimes I'm sleeping, or drunk.\u201d\n\nBut absent better alternatives, the relay network can still save small miners on cost, meaning they can increase their profit, and remain competitive, Corallo hopes.\n\n\nIt's democratizing in the sense that larger miners do something like this already,\u201d he said. \u201cThe relay network gives smaller miners a leg up, since they don't need to spend a proportionally large portion of their resources to establish these types of relay networks themselves. So it's centralizing in some ways, but, hopefully decentralizing, in others.\u201d\n\n", "year": 2015, "month": 11, "day": 19}

This is the first investment of the renowned venture capital firm in a blockchain-based fintech company.\nAlign estimates that small businesses currently pay $50 billion in wire and exchange fees. Forbes\nnotes\nthat, while wire transfers typically incur fees from the initiating bank, intermediaries and the recipient\u2019s bank, plus the foreign exchange fee, Align charges only a low 1.9 percent foreign-exchange rate.\u00a0\n\u201cWe were looking for applications of the blockchain for the last couple of years in ways that could build real businesses and add real value that weren\u2019t at the mercy of the currency valuation which will move up and down and all over the place,\u201d said KPCB general partner Randy Komisar, who will join Align\u2019s board, in a statement reported by Forbes\n. \u201cAnd of those blockchain companies, we invested in Align, because we believe it\u2019s a market that\u2019s underserved, with a CEO who understood it well and early traction from customers who reinforced that value.\u201d\nThe Align Commerce platform is targeted at mainstream business-to-business (B2B) payments. The\u00a0 users on both ends don\u2019t have to know that such things as Bitcoin or the blockchain exist; the only thing they have to know is that the platform processes payments faster and cheaper, with a single 1.9 percent fee paid by the party converting the currency.\n\u201cThe Align Commerce platform is not only a creative and transformative use of the blockchain technology, but a fundamental reimagining of how global payments can and should be done,\u201d said Komisar in an interview quoted\nby PYMNTS\n. \u201cWe see incredible potential in Align Commerce as a superior digital path to convenient, transparent cross-border transactions.\u201d\nIf a company located in the United States buys from a seller located in the Eurozone, the seller invoices in Euros, and the buyer pays in U.S. dollars plus the currency conversion fee. The fact that Align Commerce can reduce transaction fees by as much as 50 percent while still making a profit is an indication of the radical change that the blockchain can bring to the financial industry.\u00a0\nTransparency is another important benefit of the Align Commerce platform, which permits real-time tracking of all operations.\n\u201cThe $24 trillion cross-border payments market is growing at a breakneck pace, expected to eclipse $54 trillion by 2022, despite a highly inefficient and expensive system in which businesses spend over $50 billion on wire and foreign exchange fees, wait up to seven days for transactions to complete, and have no visibility into the process,\u201d said\nformer Western Union executive Marwan Forzley, now founder and CEO of Align Commerce, in April.\u00a0\n\u201cThe blockchain offers a ready alternative,\" Forzley said. \"The Align Commerce Payments Platform is the first in the industry to use this global rail to help small and medium-sized businesses quickly collect and receive payments in their local currency while avoiding high wire fees and various hidden fees.\u201d\nTechCrunch\nnotes\nthat Align isn\u2019t the only company looking to get into cross-border payments based on blockchain technology and Bitcoin.

Regulators and advocacy groups agree, though, that kneejerk regulation is not what is needed; rather, the need is thoughtful regulation and an increase in education.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with Bitcoin, it just means it\u2019s another part of our financial system,\u201d said Dana Syracuse, managing director and a member in the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Regulatory Compliance Practice at K2 Intelligence, in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0\n\nK2 Intelligence is an investigative, compliance, and cyber defense services firm. Prior to joining K2 Intelligence, he worked in the New York State Department of Financial Services and was the author of BitLicense.\n\n\u201cAs time goes on, Bitcoin\u2019s place is going to grow,\" Syracuse said. \"One of the things that I talk about is, if you look at the story of bitcoin and the kind of enforcement and prosecutorial action, it shows the evolution and growth of the space.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin is not the problem, and further restrictions on it are not the solution. Criminals and terrorists are using all sorts of technology to try to hide their activities over the Internet, but those who turn to bitcoin as part of that effort are making a big mistake,\u201d said Jason Weinstein, director of the Blockchain Alliance, in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine.\n\n\nJennifer Shasky Calvery, the director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) explained at a Digital Currency Summit held by the Department of Justice that $4 million worth of bitcoin is circulated through regulated entities. Outside the regulated entities, $10 million worth of bitcoin is circulated. At the event, Calvery made clear that her agency didn\u2019t regulate bitcoin; instead, it regulated the financial institutions.\u00a0\n\nPerianne Boring, the founder and president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, echoed those thoughts. In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine\n, she said, \u201cVirtual currency is already highly regulated, especially within the G7 nations. Despite the high degree of regulation, the majority of bitcoin transactions are taking place outside regulated entities, which are mostly outside the G7 nations.\u201d\n\n\u201cIncreasing regulation within the G7 would only increase burdens on the companies that are working hard to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and related regulations and could potentially push more bitcoin into the unregulated entities,\u201d Boring said.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat is needed is rolling out regulations in a rational, thoughtful, and constructive way,\u201d said Syracuse. \u201cWhen you regulate in the face of a crisis, there is often a temptation to overcorrect, which you want to guard against. We have to be careful on the back end of a travesty like this not to overregulate.\u201d\n\nRegulation is not the problem; it is education\n\nFundamentally, it is education that is problem, not regulation. Once regulators have sufficient education, they tend to come to the same conclusion that many others do: Bitcoin is not the problem.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little skeptical of what new regulation would exist that would help,\u201d said Vincent D\u2019Agostino, associate managing director in the U.S. Cyber Investigations and Incident Response practice at K2 Intelligence, in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0\n\nBefore joining K2 Intelligence, he was the FBI\u2019s trial agent for Silk Road 1 and the case agent for Silk Road 2.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIf more people on the counter-terrorism side took the time to educate themselves on blockchain technology, so when they did a raid and the first thing they did was take that seized data and identify the public keys so they could start to make links,\" he said. \"They could go, we didn\u2019t know who this linked to, but now we know everything they\u2019ve done. It attaches that person to those wallet files.\"\n\n\u201cEvery financial innovation, every new form of value transfer brings with it its own unique challenges,\" Syracuse explained. \"Bitcoin is not unique in that. Terrorism is a major concern of major financial systems. The use of bitcoin in those kinds of activities is no different than what goes on in the traditional banking system. Education in this space is key, and that is what will lead to rational and productive regulation and communication between the regulators.\u201d\n\nAccording to a report by the U.K. Treasury, \u201cthere is little evidence to indicate that the use of digital currencies has been adopted by criminals involved in terrorist financing, whether as a means by which to raise funds (crowd funding etc.), to pay for infrastructure (e.g. server rental), or to transfer funds.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe report also explains, \u201cThe money laundering risk associated with digital currencies is low, though if the use of digital currencies was to become more prevalent in the U.K. this risk could rise.\u201d\n\nThat is because bitcoin is actually an inefficient method for transferring value for illicit purposes since it is a completely public ledger.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt would be far easier to launder euros or dollars than it would be to launder a decentralized, blockchain-based currency like bitcoin,\u201d said David Long, the principal and senior consultant at the Northern California Fraud Prevention Solutions, in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine\n. \u201cThough from an initial investigative standpoint, bitcoin might present more of a challenge due to the necessity of uncovering who is actually responsible for a given transaction or transactions. However, once the actor's identity is uncovered, the blockchain makes it possible to uncover most, if not all, of a person's transactions.\u00a0 This capability is without parallel when the subject is dealing in euros or dollars.\u201d\n\nWeinstein further confirmed that point, saying, \u201cReports of bitcoin\u2019s anonymity are greatly exaggerated.\u00a0 Criminals or terrorists who use bitcoin to facilitate their activities are foolish, because bitcoin is traceable in a way that other payment methods, including cash, are not.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is pseudonymous in that all that is shown is on the public ledger is a public address. However, once a law enforcement officer is able to identify who owns that public address, he would then be able to track every transaction that went to and from that address. If the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) were to transfer bitcoin, and a law enforcement officer knew that it was their address, he could track each transaction and start building a case accordingly.\u00a0\n\nCash, on the other hand, is completely anonymous. An individual in ISIL could take envelopes of cash across state borders and easily pay for the necessary assets for committing an act of terror. A law enforcement official would have no way of verifying how the funds were used. Long gave an example where a trade-based money-laundering scheme using dollars or euros conducted by professionals could be virtually undetectable.\u00a0\n\nThe problem with this is that more people don\u2019t realize it.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThey [law enforcement] are not using existing bitcoin investigative techniques as much as they should,\u201d D\u2019Agostino said. \u201cThere is no doubt that when done correctly, using bitcoin can be extremely anonymous but as long as there are human beings involved in the transfer of bitcoin, the creation and maintenance of those wallets, and the movement of that digital currency, they are going to make a mistake at some point. Those mistakes are typically catastrophic from an anonymity perspective. If it\u2019s a group of people within a terror network moving a high volume of bitcoin both directions, they\u2019re going to make a mistake eventually. They\u2019ll forget to encrypt their wallets or leave their abandoned keys on a piece of discarded or seized digital device. That\u2019ll give you an opening, a crack in the door, to give law enforcement you a chance to exploit that information and connect the subject with a set of address and transactions. So what may have started as completely anonymous set of transactions now has ends up having the opposite desired affect\u201d\n\nThe key is educating law enforcement and national security authorities about how the technology works, so they can enhance their ability to use it to follow the money and protect public safety, Weinstein said. \"We need more education, not more regulation.\u201d\u00a0\n\nJerry Brito, the executive director of Coin Center, explained in a recent blog post\nwhy more education is needed: \u201cOverreaction by jittery policymakers in the wake of a crisis is always a concern, which is why education before such crises is so important. We\u2019ve been engaged in just such education for over a year, and we\u2019re hopeful policymakers understand that an overreaction would be counterproductive, whatever the headlines may say.\"\n\nBrito echoed the point made clear by Boring and Weinstein: \"The fact is that regulators understand that digital currencies do not pose the greatest risk for terrorist financing, and to the extent digital currencies pose some risk, a 'crack down' on their use would likely only serve to drive out legitimate players, which in turn would only serve to limit governments\u2019 visibility into illicit uses.\u201d\n\nBitcoin financial institutions already follow many of the same money transmitter laws that traditional institutions have to follow. Creating further regulation over them will not help prevent further acts of terrorism. Instead, educating law enforcement on the ways in which it can use the blockchain to seek and capture terrorists is one way to prevent future catastrophes.\u00a0\n\nPhoto StockMonkeys.com\n\n/ Flickr(CC)\n\n\n\n\nJacob Donnelly is a freelance journalist and a consultant in the bitcoin/blockchain space.

Merchants can request a bitcoin payment by letting their customers scan a QR code and receive the funds in their bank account the next day, free of charge. EPaisa works on any smartphone or tablet in India.\n\nIn 2013, ePaisa was awarded TechCrunch\u2019s \u201cMost Disruptive Company\u201d and made it to the 2014 Global Red Herring Top 100 as well as Asia\u2019s Top 100 awards.\n\nThe app works in 32 languages, it is free and works on all smartphones and tablets running on Android and iOS.

With this new feature, we hope to offer our merchants more ways to accept payments and stand true to our commitment of enabling commerce.\u201d\n\nEPaisa expects that the user experience will be no different for the sellers. It works as follows:\n\nAt the point of sale, when the customer wants to pay for a product with bitcoin, the ePaisa merchant taps the bitcoin icon in the ePaisa POS application. As a result, a QR code pops up with the due amount, and the customer will scan that code using his or her bitcoin wallet app.\n\nPrime Minister Modi\u2019s vision for a seamless digital economy is materializing because of companies like ePaisa, which continues driving bitcoin adoption in the East.\n\n\u201cIndia has had huge success with prepaid wallets for online transactions,\u201d Arora said. \u201cWe are enabling businesses to accept these wallets even for offline in store sales.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\n\nBitcoin is not anonymous, but, rather, pseudo-anonymous. By now, most Bitcoin veterans know this. It\u2019s less obvious to many, however, why Bitcoin is not really anonymous by default, and what can be done to de-anonymize Bitcoin users \u2013 and what Bitcoin users can do to reclaim their privacy.\n\nBelow is an advanced beginners guide to get a better understanding of the nuances of Bitcoin and anonymity.\n\n\n\nHow do Bitcoin transactions work?\n\nTo better understand Bitcoin\u2019s anonymity, it's necessary to first understand how Bitcoin works on a basic level.\n\nMost importantly, the Bitcoin protocol effectively consist of a series of transactions. These transactions are basically a package of different kinds of data, among which are transaction inputs and transaction outputs. Inputs\nrefer to Bitcoin addresses used to send bitcoin from, and can only be spent using the private key associated to that address. Outputs\neffectively refer to addresses used to send bitcoin to. Each Bitcoin transaction transfers bitcoin from one or several inputs to one or several outputs (therefore, transferring bitcoin from one or several addresses to one or several addresses).\n\nIt's possible for a transaction to simply have one input and one output. But that is rare, as it would require that the amount of bitcoin to be sent (the output) precisely equal the amount of an earlier amount received (the input).\n\nInstead, it's quite common that a transaction consists of multiple smaller inputs in order to make for one larger transaction. If someone, for instance, controls three different inputs of one bitcoin each, and needs to send 2.5 bitcoin to an online store, the software will merge all three inputs into a single transaction.\n\nAnd it's even more common that a transaction consists of multiple outputs. This is because Bitcoin uses change addresses. Change addresses allow users to create a transaction that returns the excess amount of bitcoin from one or several inputs back to the original sender. So in the example above, the software will typically create two outputs. One output attributes 2.5 bitcoin to the address belonging to the online store, while another output will attribute .5 bitcoin back to the newly generated (change) address controlled by the sender.\n\n\nWhat makes bitcoin 'anonymous'?\n\nThere are generally three reasons why bitcoin is sometimes regarded as anonymous.\n\n\nFirst, unlike bank accounts and most other payment systems, Bitcoin \naddresses are not tied to the identity of users\n on a protocol level. Anyone can create a new and completely random Bitcoin address (and the associated private key) at any time, without the need to submit any personal information to anyone.\n\nSecond, transactions are not tied to the identity of users\neither. As such, (and as long as a miner includes the transaction in a block) anyone can effectively transfer bitcoin from any address to which it controls the (private) keys, to any other address, with no need to reveal any personal information at all. Like physical cash, not even the receiver needs to know the identity of the sender.\n\nAnd third, Bitcoin transaction data is transmitted and forwarded by nodes to a random set of nodes\non the peer-to-peer network. While Bitcoin nodes do connect to each other using IP-addresses, it's not necessarily clear for nodes whether the transaction data they received was created by the node they connect to, or if that node merely forwarded that data.\n\n\n\n\nHow is anonymity defeated?\n\nThere are basically three ways to de-anonymize Bitcoin users.\n\nFirst of all, even though Bitcoin transactions are randomly transmitted over the peer-to-peer network, this system is not airtight. If an attacker, for instance, has the means to connect multiple nodes\nto the Bitcoin network, the combined data collected from these different nodes might be enough to determine where a transaction originated.\n\nSecond, Bitcoin addresses can be linked to real identities if these real identities are used in combination\nwith the Bitcoin addresses in some way. This includes addresses used to deposit or withdraw money to or from a (regulated) exchange or wallet service, publicly exposed donation addresses, or addresses simply used to send bitcoin to someone (including the online store) when using a real identity.\n\nBut perhaps most importantly, all\ntransactions over the Bitcoin network are completely transparent and traceable by anyone. It's typically this complete transparency that allows multiple Bitcoin addresses to be clustered\ntogether, and be tied to the same user. Therefore, if just one of these clustered addresses is linked to a real-world identity through one or several of the other de-anonymizing methods, all clustered addresses can be.\n\n\n\nWhat is clustering?\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at clustering.\n\nA very basic clustering method is the analysis of \ntransactions networks.\n In its most basic form, this refers to the several inputs combined into a single transaction. While these inputs could have originated from different addresses, the fact that they were combined into a single transaction suggests that all these inputs \u2013 and therefore all related addresses \u2013 are controlled by the same user.\n\nSimilarly, there are various methods to identify change addresses\nas being change addresses, which links them to the sender of the transaction. This is fairly straightforward when receiving bitcoin; the output that is not attributed to you is typically (though not always) attributed to the change address controlled by the sender. In addition, some Bitcoin software, reveals the change address to attentive onlookers, too. It does so, for instance, by always creating a change address as the last output\n\nof a transaction. The use of\n multisig-addresses\n\ncan be a giveaway as well.\n\nAnother clustering method is taint analysis. Taint analysis is fairly straightforward, too, and is even offered\nby several freely accessible block explorers. Basically, taint analysis calculates what percentage of bitcoin on a specific address originated from another specific address, whether the addresses are one transaction separated from each other \u2013 or more.\n\nAnd then there's amount analysis \nand timing analysis. Amount analysis, as the name suggests, doesn't track specific transactions, but rather specific amounts. Similarly, timing analysis tracks specific times. If, for example, one input is exactly 2.6539924 bitcoin, and an unrelated output is exactly 2.6539924 (minus fee) one block later, it suggests that the sending and receiving addresses belong to someone using some kind of mixer (see below).\n\n\n\nWhat can be done to reclaim privacy?\n\nBitcoin privacy is still very much an arms race. While progress is being made to improve Bitcoin anonymity on one hand, possible methods to de-anonymize users are often established on the other. And while it is beyond the scope of this article to explore all potential future possibilities to improve anonymity, there are some basic methods to increase privacy on the Bitcoin network available right now.\n\nOne such a straightforward solution is using TOR or other methods to hide IP addresses.\nIf Bitcoin transactions are transmitted over TOR, there is no way to determine where they originated from (granted that TOR itself does as promised, of course).\n\nAnother basic solution to increase privacy is creating a new address for each transaction. Creating a new address for each transaction makes it harder to link addresses to real identities, as it would at the very least require more clustering to do so. An increasing number of Bitcoin wallets do this automatically using  hierarchical deterministic\n\n(HD) wallet software.\n\nA slightly more advanced method to gain privacy is the use of mixers. Mixers exist in multiple shapes and forms, but they basically enable that everyone using the mixer receives each others' bitcoin. If done well, mixing counters the analysis of transaction networks as well as taint analysis. And for improved results, mixing can be repeated.\n\nOne example of such a mixing strategy is  CoinJoin, which merges inputs from and outputs to several users into one transaction \u2013 breaking the assumption that all inputs belong to the same user. CoinJoin does not, however, remove all taint from a Bitcoin address, since the inputs and outputs are still connected to some degree.\n\nAlternatively, some mixers \ncan\n remove all taint, as they return unrelated bitcoin \nfrom completely different addresses\n belonging to the mixer. However, these mixers are typically centralized, and as such \nwill \nknow the sending and receiving Bitcoin addresses belonging to users.\n\nAdditionally, to counter amount analysis, mixers can require all users to submit the same amount \ninto the mix. Alternatively, mixing services can charge a random fee, making it harder for an outsider to link the amount of bitcoin sent to the amount returned. Furthermore, it's possible to break up the amount\nmixed, further obfuscating the coins, while smaller amounts\nare easier lost in \u201cthe crowd\u201d of transactions.\n\nTo counter timing analysis, moreover, mixers can wait some random time\nbefore they send coins back; the longer this range, the harder it becomes to link transactions. Furthermore, extending the mixing time\nincreases the likelihood of transactions to be obfuscated with normal transactions.\n\nBut in the end, Bitcoin privacy is still a sliding scale \u2013 not a binary problem. Rather than being either completely anonymous or not at all, Bitcoin users enjoy a certain level of privacy, depending on how much of their identity they reveal, which of the anonymizing techniques they apply, how many, and how often.\n\nN.b.: For specific examples of mixing techniques, see the research paper cited below.\n\n\n\nThe article is largely based on  'Research on Anonymization and De-anonymization in the Bitcoin System\n',  an ATR Defense Science & Technology Lab. paper by QingChun ShenTu and JianPing Yu from Bitbank Research Labs, published by Shenzhen University.

He further emphasized the significance of financial technologies like the Bitcoin network in building strong regional and international presence for the country\u2019s banks and financial institutions.\n\n\n\n\u201cBlockchain, which is used for bitcoin can also be used for many other applications like real-time gross settlement and trade finance verification,\u201d \nsaid Loong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo our banks and regulators must keep up-to-date with these developments. The banks are in a strong position. We are in the heart of rising Asia. The banks have strong balance sheets, and with a strong regional presence they can take advantage of many opportunities around them.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn April 2015, the Singaporean government announced its ambitious plans to become Asia\u2019s leading blockchain and financial technology hub through the development of friendly regulatory environment for fintech and blockchain-focused startups. \n\n\n\nSince then, various government agencies including national-level coordinating agency Smart Nations Global Initiative have continued to maintain close relationships with startups aiming to develop unique financial applications and platforms which could potentially optimize and enhance existing banking systems.\n\n\n\nUnder the leadership of Singapore\u2019s Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cabinet Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, the Smart Nations Initiative participated in various fintech and blockchain-focused startup conferences, to help startups communicate and work with established financial institutions in the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy interest in bitcoin is the concept of a distributed ledger which does not depend on a central authority,\u201d Balakrishnan \nstated\n\n at a startup conference hosted by Singaporean startup incubator JTC LaunchPad.\n\n\n\n\nBalakrishnan explained that most of Singapore\u2019s current financial problems could be solved through the development and implementation of peer-to-peer (P2P) \u00a0transaction networks and secure transaction verification and facilitation systems.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn this concept where we can have a decentralized ledger where there can be peer-to-peer transactions, which can be facilitated and authorized, I think there is something going on here.

With the Shift Card, you can now spend bitcoin anywhere in the world that Visa is accepted.\u201d\nCoinbase users living in the states where the service is available can order a Shift debit card for $10 and link it to a Coinbase wallet. When the Shift debit card is used to make a purchase, the equivalent value of bitcoin (based on the current spot price of bitcoin on Coinbase) is debited from the user\u2019s Coinbase bitcoin wallet. For certain transactions, such as gas purchases and dinner bills, Shift will debit more than the purchase amount, and refund the remainder to the user when the final payment amount is settled.\nThere are no annual fees, no bitcoin-to-dollar conversion fees, and no domestic transaction fees. Coinbase says there are no domestic transaction fees \u201cfor a limited time,\u201d which seems to indicate that domestic transaction fees could be added in the future. There is a $2.50 ATM fee and a 3 percent international transaction fee. The daily ATM withdrawal limit is $200, and the default daily spending limit is $1,000.\nThe card isn\u2019t available to users in New York, Florida, and many other states. Coinbase and Shift Payments say that they are working through legal and regulatory matters in the states where the Shift Card is not yet available.\nShift Payments wants to integrate all payment options available to a user in one debit card. Users can connect a Shift Card to multiple accounts to seamlessly spend all supported payment means, including digital currencies, with the same card.\u00a0\n\u201cThe Shift Card works like any debit card today,\u201d notes the Shift website. \u201cConnect your existing accounts and spend Coinbase or Dwolla, immediately and directly, everywhere Visa is accepted.\u201d\nThe Shift card isn\u2019t the first bitcoin debit card, but the availability of a Visa-branded bitcoin debit card from a major bitcoin exchange and wallet operator is likely to represent a quantum leap in the space.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, what we\u2019re trying to do is make bitcoin easy to use,\u201d\u00a0 Coinbase vice president of business development and strategy Adam White, told Wired.\n \u201cWe want to make it easy to buy and sell bitcoin, and we want to make it easy to spend. A mainstream debit card based on bitcoin is a key element.\u201d\nOf course all U.S. bitcoin users already can spend their bitcoin by converting them to dollars and sending the dollars to their bank accounts, but the process is lengthy and probably overly complex for some users.\nTherefore, the Shift Card is likely to make Bitcoin much more useful in daily life.\u00a0\nWired notes that existing Coinbase customers are now likely to start spending more of their bitcoin, rather than just speculating, and new customers will be attracted to the digital currency because they can more easily spend it. Then, merchants will be more motivated to start accepting bitcoin, which could start a runaway feedback loop that will boost the Bitcoin ecosystem.\u00a0", "year": 2015, "month": 11, "day": 24}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\n\nWith Mike Hearn taking a step back from Bitcoin development to work for private blockchain startup\n R3, former Bitcoin Core lead developer Gavin Andresen indicated he might take over the lead of Bitcoin XT, the Bitcoin implementation programmed to increase the block-size limit through BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal)\n 101.\n\nAndresen, who shifted his efforts to Bitcoin XT\n earlier this year, told \nBitcoin Magazine, reluctantly: \u201cI might take over lead of XT, but I don't want to.\u201d\n\nIt was   announced \n\nlast week that Hearn recently joined R3 as lead platform engineer, where the Google veteran and Bitcoin XT lead developer will work with some of the world's largest banks on distributed ledger-based protocols for global financial markets. Hearn confirmed to Bitcoin Magazine that he will do the minimum required to keep Bitcoin XT running, but won't actively develop or advocate the implementation any longer.\n\nHearn, a staunch advocate of a block-size increase in order to allow for more transactions on Bitcoin's network,  implemented\n\nBIP 101 into Bitcoin XT this summer. With this patch, designed by Andresen, Bitcoin XT is set to increase the maximum block size to 8 megabytes if a threshold of 75 percent of mining power accepts the change. Once activated, this limit is set to double every two years.\u00a0\n\nOn  Reddit, Hearn detailed:\n\nComment from discussion Mike Hearn now working for R3CV Blockchain Consortium \u2022 /r/Bitcoin.\n\nThe implementation of BIP 101 in Bitcoin XT without industrywide consensus was considered controversial by many, in particular among the Bitcoin development community. Shortly after Hearn implemented the patch, however, several\n\n prominent\n\nBitcoin companies stated their intent to upgrade their code to support BIP 101 by December of this year. As such, the timing of Hearn's departure could have been experienced as unfortunate by supporters of a rapid block-size increase. While the Bitcoin industry could still adopt Bitcoin XT, this seems unlikely with no active lead development.\n\nSuccess of Bitcoin XT might therefore depend on Andresen taking over as lead developer, Hearn acknowledged when asked by Bitcoin Magazine. This idea \u2013 which was previously   advocated \nby Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong \u2013 was not dismissed by Andresen, though he is not keen to take such a step.\nAndresen, who is currently on MIT's payroll, explained:\n\n\nI might take over lead of XT, but I don't want to. I stepped back from lead of Core because I got tired of the constant trivial decision-making needed to lead an active open source software project. I want to spend my time thinking about and working on bigger, longer-term issues; like: 'What are the benefits and risks of increasing the maximum block size?'\u201d\n\nBIP 101 itself currently garners little support among the Bitcoin development community, and seems very unlikely to be implemented in Bitcoin Core. Regardless, Andresen does expect that BIP 101 might be adopted by the industry at large. Either through Bitcoin XT, or by miners, companies and other users implementing the patch in their own software.\n\n\nIt depends on what comes out of the big Hong Kong meeting,\u201d Andresen explained. \u201cIf the other developers can't make up their minds and reach consensus on a solution, then we'll have a messy, chaotic couple of months where companies and big mining pools or miners pick sides until a solution emerges. Though, in that case, I do expect that the most likely solution will be BIP 101, since it is the only solution with well-tested code they can download and run.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nPhoto \nWeb Summit\n\n\n / \nFlickr(CC)\n\n\n\n", "year": 2015, "month": 11, "day": 25}

The first is with the block reward, which is 25BTC approximately every 10 minutes. The other way is with transaction fees. The block reward also acts as the mechanism in which new supply of bitcoin is generated. Because mining tends to reward those that can do the most work, miners deploy increasing amounts of hardware to try to be the first to mine each block. To keep a steady block creation rate, Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto put in place a rule that updates the network difficulty every 2016 blocks, or approximately two weeks.\u00a0\n\nAccording to Bitcoin Wisdom, the difficulty increase that took place today rose by 10.44%. The last time the difficulty increased by more than 10 percent was on November 5, 2014, when the difficulty increased by 10.05 percent. Further, Bitcoin Wisdom is predicting that the next bitcoin difficulty increase in 2 weeks will be 10.25%. The last time there were two double digit percentage increases in difficulty was August 19, 2014 and August 31, 2014.\u00a0\n\nBut the increase in difficulty makes sense.\u00a0\n\nThe next generation of bitcoin miners have been released by three of the top companies in the space. In August, Bitmain announced the launch of the Antminer S7, which contains the BM1385 ASIC. Each S7 can generate upwards of 4,850 GH/s while only using 0.25 J/GH of power.\u00a0\n\nIn October, the Chinese mining firm BW announced\nthat it was releasing its next stage bitcoin miner, which would contain a 14nm chip. Virgilio Lizardo Jr., head of international at Bitbank, told Bitcoin Magazine\nthat the first batch of servers released would be 48 petahash total. For context, the current network has a hash rate of 550.5 PH/s.\u00a0\n\nFinally, the original creator of the ASIC miner, Avalon, announced\nthat it was releasing its latest miner, the Avalon6, which would contain the new A3218 mining chip. Each miner would be able to generate 3.65 TH/s of hashing power.\u00a0 While these new miners have just hit the market, it is additional hardware that should come online over the coming weeks.\u00a0\n\nThe reality is simple: As the price of bitcoin increases, the number of people who can make a profit mining increases. That encourages more participation in securing the network, which results in the need for a difficulty increase. As these next generation of bitcoin miners come online, it is expected that the difficulty will continue to counteract the additional hash rate in the network.\u00a0\n\nJacob Donnelly is a freelance journalist and a consultant in the bitcoin/blockchain space.

Slush Pool was the first mining pool on the Bitcoin network to allow miners to vote for BIP 101, but recently suspended this option due to\nsustained DDoS attacks\non its servers.\n\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Slush Pool operator Marek Palatinus said: \u201cWe're strengthening our infrastructure and we plan to enable BIP 101 mining again.\u201d\n\nThe block-size dispute might reach a critical juncture over the next weeks, with the upcoming Scaling Bitcoin\n\nworkshop in Hong Kong in the first week of December, and the stated intent of\n several\n\n prominent\n\nBitcoin companies to change their code to allow for bigger blocks that same month. As such, Bitcoin miners (and pools) might be faced with an important decision as to which code they will support.\n\nPalatinus said that the effort to re-enable miners to vote for bigger blocks is unrelated to this \u201cDecember deadline,\u201d however.\n\n\u201cWe're not focused on December with our decision, but we still think the block-size limit should be increased,\u201d Palatinus explained. \u201cSometimes there are already blocks full of valid transactions, and there's not any particular reason why user experience with bitcoin transactions should be limited because of an arbitrary limit of 1 megabyte.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe're close friends to Paralelni Polis, the first \u2013 and only? \u2013 bitcoin-only cafe and co-working space, located in Prague near our offices.

We also see issues related with transactions not going through the Bitcoin network and how it affects bitcoin acceptance. For this reason we consider this an urgent issue.\u201d\n\nBIP 101 \u2013 which is implemented in alternative Bitcoin implementation Bitcoin XT \u2013 is programmed to increase the maximum block size to 8 megabytes if a threshold of 75 percent of mining power accepts the change. Once activated, this limit is set to double every two years. Much like before, however, Slush Pool does not intend to force connected miners to vote for a BIP 101 block increase with their hashing power. Instead, individual miners will be given the option to cast such a vote if they want to.\n\n\u201cWe personally hope BIP 101 will be adopted, but we do not want to enforce BIP 101 mining on our pool,\u201d Palatinus said. \u201cWe believe in open discussion and democracy. For this reason we want to tell our miners about all options, explain their pros and cons, and let them individually decide by their mining vote.\u201d\n\nBIP 101 has received criticism within the Bitcoin development community, the main concern being that its exponential growth curve might lead to oversized blocks. While an increased block size would allow for more transactions on the Bitcoin network, \u201cDecentralists\n\n\u201d fear that oversized blocks could further centralize mining and full nodes \u2013 in turn, potentially harming Bitcoin's censorship resistance.\n\nPalatinus, however, believes the risks of BIP 101 are being exaggerated, explaining:\n\n\u201cImproved block compression solutions will be able to vastly decrease the risk of oversized risks in regard of centralization of mining. Additionally, Bitcoin's blockchain file is impractically big for common use already. Normal users don't run Bitcoin Core anymore, because there are many other easier and more user-friendly solutions for managing bitcoin than Core. For those who want to have a full copy for any reason, there won't be a much bigger difference.\u201d\n\nFinally, Palatinus added that Slush Pool is open to alternative block increase proposals, too.\u00a0\n\nOne alternative block-size proposal that has been gathering support is an incremental increase to 8 megabytes over four years time. Proposed as a temporary solution by  Blockstream\n\nCEO and hashcash inventor Dr. Adam Back, this \u201c2-4-8\u201d option seems\n acceptable\n\nto a significant segment of the Bitcoin Core development team, as well as prominent\n industry\n\n members.\n\nWhen asked by Bitcoin Magazine\nabout the 2-4-8 quick fix, Palatinus said: \u201cThis will only move the same discussion to the future, not solving the real issue.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\n\nBitcoin requires\n decentralization\n\n of miners (or mining pools) and full nodes to achieve what some consider its core property: censorship resistance. As such, the block-size dispute represents a trade-off. Bigger blocks allow for more transactions on the Bitcoin network, but take more time to propagate, favoring larger miners and pools, while the increased data transmission disincentivizes users to run full nodes.\n\n\nFortunately, there are proposals to increase Bitcoin's efficiency that reduce the risk of bigger blocks. One of the most promising innovations in this regard, are Invertible Bloom Lookup Table, or IBLTs. First  introduced\n\nby Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Core developer Gavin Andresen, this idea was picked up and is currently worked on as a side-project by Linux veteran and Blockstream's Lightning Network developer Paul \u201cRusty\u201d Russell.\n\n\u201cIf we can make this work, it means less bandwidth requirements and less block data, which should be good for network health all over,\u201d says Russell.\n\n\n\nRedundancy\n\n\nSo what problem do IBLTs solve?\n\nTypically, all Bitcoin transactions are transmitted from node to node over the peer-to-peer network, to be stored by the mempools (the record of unconfirmed transactions) of individual nodes. When a miner finds a block, it includes (some of) these transactions in that block, and subsequently transmits this block over the same peer-to-peer network. Of course, this means that all transactions in the block are effectively sent over the network twice: once as a transaction, and once as part of a block.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Russell explained:\n\n\u201cWe've got redundancy in blocks. Most nodes already know some of the content in that block; they have already seen it. If we can optimize that, we can speed up block transmission. That decreases centralization pressure because miners can get their blocks out faster, while the network works better ... it's all good.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Magic of IBLTs\n\n\nThe main problem \u2013 the reason we need IBLTs to solve this problem (rather than a straightforward compression algorithm) \u2013 is that the set of transactions included in blocks is often not exactly identical as those stored by the mempools of all individual nodes; the biggest difference being the latest transactions transmitted over the network before the block was found. Moreover, the mempools of all individual nodes usually differ from each other a bit, too. This makes it hard to know which transactions a miner included in the new block, without seeing the whole block.\n\nThat\u2019s where IBLTs come in. IBLTs combine several mathematical tricks to enable set reconciliation. As such, they basically allow for two slightly different mempools to be compared and harmonized, without actually needing both mempools in full.\n\nThis works as follows:\n\nAt first, all transactions included in a block are written into a table, where each transaction starts at a different spot in that table. However, there are many more transactions than there is room in the table, so the result is hopelessly overlapping. This makes the IBLT very compact, but also unreadable and undecipherable for anyone who doesn't have access to any transaction data himself.\n\nAnyone who does\nhave transaction data, however, can compare the overlapping transaction data in the IBLT to his own transaction data by filling up an IBLT with his own transactions using similar logic. If both IBLTs end up looking exactly the same, it means all transactions match exactly.\n\nBut even if the IBLTs do not\nend up looking exactly the same, this can still be helpful, as long as the sets of transactions are fairly similar. In that case, the IBLTs can be compared in such a way that all identical transactions cancel each other out. The \u201cleftovers\u201d in the IBLT, then, can often be used to reconstruct the missing transactions.\n\nSo rather than needing to transmit full blocks over the peer-to-peer network, nodes can transmit the much smaller IBLTs instead. This requires less data to be sent around and is much faster.\n\n\n\nEfficiency\n\n\nAnd it gets better. In Russell's design, not even all of the transactions included in new blocks need to fit in the IBLTs. Instead, connected nodes on Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network fine tune which transactions to send to peers. This could increase propagation time and decrease data usage even more.\n\n\u201cGavin's original idea was that the miner would produce the IBLT, and send every node on the network the same one,\u201d Russell said. \u201cBut when we started playing with the concept, it turned out it's very fast to generate IBLTs. So why not have every node do it? Generate IBLTs per peer, because each node has a much better idea of how close its mempool has been to a peer; they're sending this stuff back and forth all the time.\u201d\n\nMoreover, connected nodes can continually learn to understand each other's behavior. So once a node receives an IBLT from the network, and constructs a valid block out of it, it knows how many transactions it was missing. Additionally, it learned over time how many transactions his peer typically differers from him. That difference \u2013 the transactions it had to construct plus the usual difference between the two peers \u2013 is what the node will include in the IBLT and send to its peer.\u00a0\n\nAs such, the IBLT system can improve over time, limiting the amount of data to transmit over the network to the bare minimum.\n\n\u201cThe IBLT must roughly be twice the data size of the transaction difference,\u201d Russell explained. \u201cSo out of all the transactions one node didn't know were in a block, plus the transactions that node thought were in the block but weren't... basically double that, and that's how big the IBLT needs to be. So if the differences are small, it will work really well.\n\n\u201cIdeally, if we can cram this thing into two IP packets,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are lightning fast.\u201d\n\nSpecific details of IBLTs and Bitcoin can be found on\n \nRussell's blog\n\n\n and \nAndresen\u2019s GitHub contribution.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 11, "day": 24}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nA common criticism often thrown at Bitcoin is its heavy use of computing power, which in turn requires a large amount of energy. Some critics of the system believe that power is being wasted on useless computations that don\u2019t contribute much at all to society, but this line of thinking misses the point of why Bitcoin works in the first place. \nMastering Bitcoin\n author\n \nAndreas Antonopoulos\n\n gave a \ntalk\n\n on consensus algorithms and Bitcoin at University College London \n(UCL\n)\n over the summer, where he argued against this common misconception about Bitcoin\u2019s supposed wastefulness.\n\nElectricity Underpins Bitcoin\u2019s Security Model\n\nThe key point that some individuals miss when it comes to the electricity used to mine bitcoin is that the electricity is what provides the security for Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized ledger. Without it, the miners who audit the ledger and create new \nblocks\n\n would be far less trustworthy. The loss of trust would come from the low barrier of entry to bitcoin mining. Antonopoulos was able to explain this point during his talk at UCL:\n\n\u201cYou will hear people say that Bitcoin wastes electricity. Bitcoin does not waste electricity. Bitcoin uses electricity to underpin the security function because it creates an economic system whereby in order to participate you have to incur cost. And by incurring cost -- the only reason you would incur cost is for the possibility of reward, and the possibility of reward is determined by whether your block meets the consensus rules.\u201d\n\nThe cost of electricity essentially acts as a \nCAPTCHA\n\n on steroids for anyone who wishes to create new blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Game-Theoretical Equilibrium\n\nMany people view Bitcoin as a strictly technical innovation based on code, but the reality is the game-theoretical attributes of the system are what hold everything together. Antonopoulos explained how the cost of hashing power on the network is a vital part of Bitcoin\u2019s incentive structure that keeps everything running smoothly:\n\n\u201cYou spend money, and if you play fair by the rules, you get money back. If you spend money and you try to cheat, you don\u2019t get money back, which means you lose money, so therefore, it doesn\u2019t pay to cheat. And that simple, game-theoretical equilibrium is the core of the Bitcoin consensus algorithm.\u201d\n\nLater in the talk, the author of \nMastering Bitcoin\n added a more direct explanation of how the electricity used to mine bitcoin aligns incentives and is not wasteful:\n\n\u201cYou align the interest of the miner, who is \u2018wasting\u2019 electricity or using electricity, with validating the consensus rules.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Hashing Computations are Not Useless\n\nThe key point to take away from this excerpt of Antonopoulos\u2019s presentation is that all of the hashing power pointed at the Bitcoin network is not useless. All of that processing power and electricity is, essentially, being used to create a new public good -- the blockchain. Until there is an alternative to \nproof-of-work\n\n that is \n enough to power a global, decentralized ledger, it would not be correct to call bitcoin mining useless or wasteful -- unless, of course, you don\u2019t think Bitcoin provides any value to the world.", "year": 2015, "month": 11, "day": 2}

It\u2019s not often that a technology paradigm has so many great ideas packaged into a small capsule. There is little wonder why all the top banks and investors are backing it with more than $750 million in funding.\nWhy all the hype around blockchain? Let\u2019s take a look at some of the blockchain\u2019s most extraordinary features. \n\u00a0\n\nSelf-regulating platform\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s not often that one comes across a system that can regulate itself with little or no human intervention. In any industry like finance, the central bank and a regulatory body (such as the SEC) lay down rules and provide governance. The blockchain eliminates the need for a corporation or government entity to regulate the operations of the system.\u00a0\nBlockchain has a provide proof-of-work concept, where peer computer nodes approve every transaction. The system has built-in checks and balances to ensure a set of colluding computers can\u2019t game the system. All these checks and monitoring are done by computers. There are alternatives to proof-of-work, including other consensus models, but the central idea of peer-to-peer clients or nodes managing the system, remains. What\u2019s more, the blockchain brings in an element of transparency, which reduces fraud as it\u2019s visible to a large global community to monitor or govern it \u2013 \u201ccrowd sourced regulation.\u201d Imagine the savings and efficiency this concept could usher in.\nLegally sound and binding\n\nThe actors (users) and their actions (sending money or assets to somebody else) are recorded on the blockchain. Any disagreement between two counterparties can be traced and proved in a court of law. This is possible because all transactions have a public/private key cryptography aspect and the transactions, once added to the blockchain, are immutable. Any record, once added to the blockchain, is tamper-proof. The current holder of the asset or digital currency in the blockchain will have his or her public key in the block. The transaction then needs to be signed by the private key of the previous owner of the asset. The blockchain also allows alternative approval mechanisms, such as requiring two persons to sign-off on a transaction. In a system not backed by a corporate or government, a legally binding mechanism dramatically improves the trust factor.\nBuilt-in business continuity\n\nA global platform on which critical financial transactions take place cannot afford to shut down. The blockchain, being a peer-to-peer network, with many distributed nodes and supporting computer servers, is highly reliable. Every participating node has a copy of the entire blockchain ledger. This makes the whole network fault-tolerant because a couple of nodes failing will not hinder the operation of the rest of the network. This gives it 24/7 availability without using any complex technologies like a disaster recovery center or database redundancy.\nEvolving model with no baggage\n\nThere are rules and criteria that exist to help determine who can approve transactions and what checks need to be made before the transaction is allowed to be added to the blockchain. The blockchain can fork into newer versions based on the changing environment and business demands. In tune with the overall Bitcoin philosophy, such changes will have to be adopted by all the users and would have to be equally beneficial. In addition, these enhancements don\u2019t affect the transactions that already have occurred and been confirmed on the blockchain. This adds the extra element of robustness and flexibility.\nSeveral comparisons have been made between the Internet and the blockchain in areas including potential growth and business prospects.\u00a0\u00a0Both systems have similar traits. The Internet has little or no central governance (except for a few guidelines to determine URL naming conventions and domain registration), it has redundancy and is fault-tolerant.\u00a0The Internet also has evolved over many years, from basic text to rich graphics, videos and animations without affecting existing systems and content.\nThe blockchain has proved its capability and usefulness as demonstrated by the Bitcoin network. Lao Tzu a famous Chinese philosopher once said, \u201cDo the difficult things while they are easy and do the great things while they are small. A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.\u201d This could be the tenet for all the early adopters of the blockchain.", "year": 2015, "month": 11, "day": 3}

The gap between the Chinese and American exchanges widened to $23.\n\u00a0\n\nThe last time the price of bitcoin was above $400 was back in November 2014. \u00a0\nAmidst the conversation about the price rising, eclipsing previous 52-week highs, is a desire to justify the price appreciation. According to Jack Liu of OKCoin, one of the drivers has been a desire for \u201cmainland [China] speculators to move to other assets after the stock market fallout.\u201d\nHowever, another possibility is that some of the Bitcoin demand has been driven by a large MMM Ponzi scheme, according to several Chinese exchanges.\u00a0\nOn October 15th, BTCC tweeted out a warning that there might be certain investments being offered to individuals that were not entirely legitimate. \n1/ We've had reports of dubious \"investments\" involving #bitcoin. These may be ponzi schemes designed to steal your bitcoins.\u2014 BTCC (@YourBTCC) October 14, 2015\n\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to the three primary Chinese exchanges\u2014Huobi, OKCoin, and BTCC\u2014for comment regarding this warning. Huobi provided the following statement:\n\u201cWe believe that most of the investors hold a positive attitude towards the future development of bitcoin industry. However, money is neutral. Capital flow is the reflection of the market movement. We can\u2019t deny that MMM to a certain extent pushed the recent spike of bitcoin price. The new investment model of MMM attracted a lot of investors, however it is unsustainable,\u201d said Astrid Tao, Operation & International Marketing Manager at Huobi.\u00a0\nTao went on to say that, \u201cFrom the viewpoint of an exchange platform, it\u2019s hard to tell the purpose and reason why they invest in bitcoin. But we\u2019ll do our best to lead these new investors to rediscover bitcoin and the industry, and to guide them to participate in trading in a right way.\u201d\nMMM was an organization that ran the world\u2019s largest Ponzi scheme in the 1990s. The founder, Sergei Mavrodi, is believed to have defrauded anywhere from 5 to 40 million people in the amount of $40 billion.\u00a0\nThe Mail & Guardian reported on a MMM scheme taking place in South Africa utilizing bitcoin as the means of transferring value. However, those that have participated don\u2019t view it as an investment, but rather, a donation.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly how it works, but I am not making an investment, \u201c Kgomotso (not his real name) told Mail & Guardian. \u201cI am just donating money to somebody, and then somebody will donate to me. People talk \u2018investment\u2019, but this is us helping each other.\u201d\nIn essence, a user who signed up to the MMM today would purchase bitcoin to give to members who signed up yesterday. All along, the user who signed up today would hope that users would sign up tomorrow to give them bitcoin.\u00a0\nBitcoin Magazine  has reached out to BTCC and OKCoin for comment on the MMM Ponzi scheme and will update this piece as more information is available.\u00a0\nJacob Donnelly is a full-time product manager and freelance journalist covering stocks, business and bitcoin.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nCheckLockTimeVerify  (CLTV) has been merged into Bitcoin Core. This is generally considered great news, because it means that Bitcoin's potential has improved drastically. In particular, the patch that was proposed by Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd allows for the proper establishment of payment channels. This means that Bitcoin users will be able to transact cheaper, faster, and at a higher volume than usual, while maintaining all of the advantages as offered by the blockchain.\nWhat is CheckLockTimeVerify?\nThe CLTV concept is fairly simple. Essentially, it allows users to create a bitcoin transaction of which the transaction outputs are spendable only at some point in the future. As such, the bitcoin sent in that transaction are time-locked until either a specified date, or until a certain number of blocks has been mined.\nThis in itself is a neat addition that can be used for various purposes. It would be easy, for example, for a dad to grant his son bitcoin as a present, but which the son could use only when he turns 18. Or it could perhaps be used to pay rent on a specific date.\nThese sorts of applications are relatively straightforward. But CLTV gets really interesting when combined with additional Bitcoin tricks.\n\u00a0\nWhat are payment channels?\nAs perhaps its most important function, CLTV is necessary for properly functional payment channels. These channels are effectively a series of \u201coff-chain\u201d transactions, that benefit from all the security of typical on-chain transactions, and with some added benefits.\nLets say that Bob streams a video, which costs one satoshi per second to watch, and Alice wants to watch that video. It would not be a great idea to use regular bitcoin transactions worth a satoshi for each individual second streamed, since a typical transaction fee costs more than one satoshi, and transactions confirm only once every 10 minutes on average. On top of that, the Bitcoin network is currently limited to a handful of transactions per second, which means that Alice's transactions would be a huge burden on the system. Moreover, only a handful of people could watch Bob's stream at the same time before the whole Bitcoin network clogged up.\nTherefore, Alice and Bob decide to open a payment channel instead. Before she starts watching the video, Alice sends \u2013 say \u2013 one bitcoin to a multi-signature address. And Alice and Bob each control one of two keys required to send funds from that address.\nNow, Alice wants to start watching the video. She signs a transaction from the multisig address, in which she sends 99,999,999 satoshi's to herself, and one satoshi to Bob. Bob could now sign this transaction at any time, and claim the satoshi attributed to him. Therefore, he allows Alice to watch one second of his stream.\nHowever, and importantly, Bob doesn't actually claim his satoshi right away, because he believes Alice will probably want to watch longer than one second. And here comes the trick: Alice signs a new transaction from the same multisig address, this time sending herself 99,999,998 satoshi's, and sending Bob 2 satoshi's. Once again, Bob could sign this transaction at any time, and claim the two satoshi's attributed to him. But he could not sign and broadcast both transactions, as that would constitute a double spend! Therefore, he would have to choose. And unless Bob is keen on losing money, he would always sign the biggest transaction. If he does, he will effectively receive one satoshi per second \u2013 even though he didn't actually receive a new transaction worth a single satoshi every second.\nThis process can be repeated as long as Bob doesn't sign his part of the transactions. So for every second that Alice watches the video, Bob can claim an additional satoshi, with no need to wait for confirmations on the blockchain. And since only one transaction \u2013 the last one for Bob to claim \u2013 is actually recorded on the blockchain, Alice and Bob do not clog up the Bitcoin network with micro-transactions, and they need to pay only a single mining fee.\nSo why do payment channels require CLTV?\nThere is one problem. What if, for some unforeseeable reason, Bob cannot or will not transmit the transaction at all? Perhaps because he falls of a cliff, or he loses his private key, or maybe he holds Alice's bitcoin ransom and demands a bigger cut, or some other reason. In that case, Alice will have lost her bitcoin, even if she didn't watch Bob's video stream long enough for it to be worth a bitcoin.\nThat's where CLTV comes in.\nAlice can add CLTV to the initial bitcoin transaction, using it to send the whole bitcoin back to her own address. This transaction is validated \u2013 for example \u2013 one day later, but only if Alice and Bob didn't sign the multi-signature transaction before that time. Now, if Bob doesn't sign the transaction at all for whatever reason, Alice can sign it by herself and is guaranteed to get her money back.\nWorst case scenario for Alice is that she would need to wait a day. She might be a bit annoyed, but she will not lose any money. As such, the whole process has been made completely trustless.\nActivation\nOn a final note, it should be mentioned that the CLTV concept is actually not new at all; it has existed in Bitcoin since the early days. With the previous incarnation of the time-locked concept, however, locked transactions were not actually included in the blockchain until a certain point in time. Rather, they were kept by Alice and (more importantly) Bob, to transmit over the Bitcoin network once the time-lock expired.\nBy actually baking it into the protocol as CLTV does, the payment channel process is better streamlined and more robust. Perhaps most importantly, it disables payment channel failures caused by  transaction malleability .\nAlthough CLTV is officially merged into Bitcoin Core now, it's not quite in use yet. First, it will be rolled out with the latest version of Bitcoin Core: 0.12. This is  scheduled  for early 2016. Alternatively, CLTV might be implemented in an update to Bitcoin Core 0.11, in which case CLTV will be available at an earlier (so-far unspecified) date.\nAfter that, a super-majority of Bitcoin miners \u2013 75 percent of hashing power \u2013 will need to signify they are ready and prepared to allow CLTV. This seems unlikely to cause much trouble, as there is no real opposition to the patch.\nThanks to Blocktrail  CTO Ruben de Vries and  Bitonic  CEO Jouke Hofman   for added feedback.", "year": 2015, "month": 11, "day": 4}

Considered one of the Big Four auditory firms along with PwC, Ernst & Young, and KPMG, Deloitte is the second-largest professional services network in the world by revenue and largest by the number of professionals. The company provides audit, tax, consulting, enterprise risk and financial advisory services with more than 200,000 professionals in more than 150 countries.\nWatts\n, based in the New York office, is a core member of Deloitte\u2019s Capital Markets Technology practice and a national leader of the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) service offering. The reputation of Deloitte should ensure that Watts\u2019 advice on Bitcoin regulation is taken into account by regulators and policymakers.\n\u201cThe Bitcoin 'blockchain' is a fundamental breakthrough in computer science that solves what seemed to be an unsolvable problem: how to ensure that a digital transaction happens only once,\u201d notes Watts. \u201cYet there is a critical question that is hanging over Bitcoin, potentially slowing the pace of innovation, and adoption, i.e., how will Bitcoin be regulated\u200b?\u201d\nWatts argues that global policymakers and regulators should consider giving Bitcoin more time to develop before insisting on regulation.\u00a0 Other key technology innovation such as the telephone, airplanes, radio, mobile phones, and the Internet, were given much more time to develop before coming under serious regulatory supervision.\u00a0\n\u201cIn fact, serious efforts to regulate disruptive technologies have traditionally been a function of the technology achieving mass adoption,\u201d says Watts. Overwhelming regulatory supervision of Bitcoin is happening much too soon, only six years into the development of Bitcoin and \u201ca long way away from the time it has typically taken for new technologies to achieve mass adoption in the past.\u201d\nIn fact, Bitcoin is still very far from mass adoption, and represents but a very small fraction of the global economy. Though Bitcoin is all over the press \u2013 albeit often with shallow and sensationalist coverage \u2013 and venture capital investments in the Bitcoin space are taking off, only a tiny minority of people own bitcoin and use it to pay for goods and services.\n\u201cThe highest daily dollar volume for Bitcoin transactions globally in February 2015 was less than $57 million, which is less than 1 percent of the average daily transaction volume for credit card platforms as measured in 2012,\u201d  notes Watts. Therefore, Bitcoin adoption is not yet skyrocketing with such a disruptive speed to warrant panic regulatory interventions.\nAnother important argument is that we could be still very far from real products that can generate true demand for Bitcoin-related services from mainstream consumers.\u200b In fact, Bitcoin's most valuable and important uses may have yet to be invented. Watts notes that Bitcoin is much more than just digital money \u2013 its real value is the ability of blockchain technology to establish trust between parties who don\u2019t know each other.\u00a0\nThat, Watts notes, may very well change how people live and interact. \u201cBitcoin is likely to follow a path where one innovation leads to another and ultimately, the very products, services, and capabilities that were once difficult or impossible to imagine, become necessities in our daily lives,\u201d he said.\nWatts worries that policymakers and regulators, in looking to protect the public from all of the bad outcomes we might anticipate today, could \u201cend up stifling the myriad (as yet) unimaginable capabilities that could potentially change the world for the better.\u201d\u00a0\nHis concluding recommendation is that American industry groups, policymakers and regulators should collaborate and consider whether the United States should be the country that provides the most supportive environment for Bitcoin-related innovation.", "year": 2015, "month": 10, "day": 31}

In 2001, legendary cryptographer Nick Szabo spoke of smart contracts that solved the problem of trust by being self-executing and having property embedded with information about who owns it. For example, the key to a car might operate only if the car has been paid for according to the terms of a contract.\n\u201c[Smart contracts] embed contracts in all sorts of property that is valuable and controlled by digital means,\u201d wrote Szabo in 1997. \u201cSmart contracts reference that property in a dynamic, often proactively enforced form, and provide much better observation and verification where proactive measures must fall short. [These protocols] would give control of the cryptographic keys for operating the property to the person who rightfully owns that property, based on the terms of the contract.\u201d\nNow Slock.it, a German startup specialized in blockchain and IoT applications, is moving to realize Szabo\u2019s vision of smart contracts embedded in IoT-enabled devices. The company will sell smart locks linked to the Ethereum blockchain. \u201cIf you can lock it, we will let you rent, sell or share it,\u201d promises the company\u2019s website.\n\u201cWhen someone purchases a Slock, it will be connected to the Slock smart contract in the Ethereum blockchain and controlled by it,\u201d says Slock.it co-founder Christoph Jentzsch. \u201cThe owner of a Slock can set a deposit amount and a price for renting his property, and the user will pay that deposit through a transaction to the Ethereum blockchain (without us), thereby getting permission to open and close that smart lock through their smart phone.\u201d\n\u201cThe deposit will be locked in the Ethereum blockchain until the user decides to return the virtual key by sending another transaction to the Ethereum blockchain,\u201d continues Jentzsch. \u201cThen the contract will be automatically enforced. The deposit will be sent back to the user minus the price for the rental, which will be automatically sent to the owner of the Slock. All of this happens without any assistance from a third party!\u201d\nInternational Business Times\nnotes that smart-lock technology could decentralize the sharing economy, empowering anyone to easily rent, share or sell anything that can be locked, which means disrupting the disruptors, including companies such as Airbnb and other intermediaries based around some form of physical access.\u00a0\n\u201cI use [Uber and Airbnb] and appreciate the progress they are making in bringing awareness to the sharing economy, but I would prefer a system that would allow me to deal directly with the owner without any third parties skimming off the top,\u201d says Jentzsch.\nSmart locks could also control access to cars, bicycles and storage units. While bicycles and storage units are ideal initial use cases, unlikely to present too many regulatory obstacles, cars with smart locks for access control are a potentially disruptive use case that could threaten the business model of Uber and Zipcar.\u00a0\nCars could be parked in city roads waiting for the next customer, located with a phone app, rented by the hour and unlocked with the app by \u201cpaying the lock\u201d in the Ethereum blockchain, used, and parked again. Around 2020, rental cars with smart locks could be also self-driving and pick up new customers autonomously. It\u2019s evident that these innovations could radically change city life.\nJentzsch is scheduled to unveil more information in a talk at Ethereum\u2019s Developer Conference, DEVCON , in London on Thursday, November 12.\u00a0\n\n\u201cCould the existing \u2018sharing economy\u2019 companies soon become irrelevant?\u201d reads the announcement of the talk . \u201cThat\u2019s what the German startup Slock.it hopes to demonstrate next week when it unveils a technology promising to empower anyone to easily rent, share or sell anything that can be locked.\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 11, "day": 5}

(tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBrian Armstrong, CEO of \nrecord-funded\n\n Bitcoin wallet service and exchange \nCoinbase\n,\n plans a code update to allow for bigger blocks in the second week of December, and has indicated he prefers \nBIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) 101\n.\n This makes Coinbase the latest Bitcoin industry heavyweight to endorse the proposal as adopted by alternative Bitcoin implementation \nBitcoin XT\n,\n although the company is still open to other solutions.\n\nArmstrong recently sent out a \nseries\n\n of\n\n tweets\n\n in support of a block-size increase, in which he stated the intention to upgrade his company's code by December. It was not clear, however, whether these tweets indicated support for BIP 101, the block-increase proposal that is programmed to increase the maximum block size eightfold to 8MB, doubling each other year until it reaches 8GB. While BIP 101 is endorsed by \nseveral\n\n leading companies in the Bitcoin space, other proposals have gathered \nsignificant\n\n support\n,\n too.\n\nSpeaking to \nBitcoin Magazine,\n Armstrong confirmed that Coinbase plans to upgrade its code to allow for bigger blocks in December of this year. And while the preferred solution is not set in stone, Coinbase currently favors BIP 101.\n\n\u201cWe are open to evaluating all proposals which increase the block size. But we do plan to upgrade around the second week of December, so this will require working solutions in code by then. The only one I'm aware of which currently has working code is BIP 101,\u201d Armstrong said.\n\nMoreover, Armstrong indicated that he'd like the Bitcoin industry to switch to Bitcoin XT, the alternative Bitcoin implementation run by Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen that implemented BIP 101 in August of this year.\n\n\u201cIn my view, Bitcoin XT is the best option I've seen so far. Not just because it has working code, but also because it has a simple implementation that is easy to understand, the block-size increases seem about right to me, and I have confidence in the people behind the project. My preference at this point would be to have Gavin step up as the final decision-maker on Bitcoin XT, and have the industry move to that solution with help from Mike Hearn, Jeff Garzik and others that wish to do so.\u201d\n\nThe CEO believes an upgrade is urgently needed in order for the Bitcoin network to handle a sudden increase of Bitcoin usage. As such, Armstrong emphasized that Coinbase will not wait for consensus to form among the Bitcoin development community.\n\n\u201cWe will upgrade regardless of whether Bitcoin Core is updated,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cCapacity planning is something you should try to get ahead of. Growth can be unpredictable, and I want to remove all blockers to Bitcoin's success. I've been disappointed to see how slow Bitcoin Core has moved on this issue, and we're open to switching forks.\u201d\n\nIn an \nopen letter\n\n published in September, a selection of prominent Bitcoin developers urged the Bitcoin community to take the time to evaluate proposals that have been put forward and agree on the best solutions via the consensus-building process. In particular, many of these developers argue that a switch to bigger blocks represents a big, perhaps even existential \nsecurity risk\n.\n\nArmstrong told \nBitcoin Magazine\n that he is aware of the potential risks of increasing the block-size limit, but said he believes these are being overstated.\n\n\u201cWhen people offer opinions on things like this, it's important to consider their qualifications. In my case, I've implemented a Bitcoin node from scratch. I created the first version of the one Coinbase uses in production today, and I've helped us scale this bitcoin node from 0 to 2.7 million customers. So I've learned quite a lot about scaling a Bitcoin node during that time.\u201d Armstrong explained. \u201cIt is a difficult judgment call, but I believe it is low enough risk, and the upside is considerable enough to make it worth it.\u201d\n\nOther leading Bitcoin companies published an \nopen letter\n\n in August in which they vowed to upgrade their code to increase the maximum block size. The letter expressed support for BIP 101, although three \nof\n\n \nits\n\n \nsigners\n\n have since indicated that alternative block increase proposals will be considered as well.\n\nPhoto \nTechCrunch\n\n / \nFlickr (CC)\n\n", "year": 2015, "month": 11, "day": 3}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nWith the recent spike in bitcoin's exchange rate, there has been a surge in transaction volume on the Bitcoin network, too. And while most in the Bitcoin community welcome the significant uptrend, some have also\n \nexpressed\n\n \nconcern\n.\n This might be the first \u201cBitcoin boom\u201d to be influenced by the 1 megabyte maximum block size, which limits the number of possible transactions on the network to about three per second.\n\nBitcoin XT developer Mike Hearn, in particular,\n \npredicted\n\n in May of this year that a new hype-cycle could lead to full blocks, rising fees, increased confirmation times, a bulging memory pool, nodes dropping of the network, more attempted double spends, and ultimately, users leaving Bitcoin for good.\n\nSo how are we doing so far?\n\nAre blocks filling up?\n\nYes.\n\nBlocks are filling up, or at least\n \nsome of them\n\n are. The number of transactions on the Bitcoin network has roughly\n \ndoubled\n\n over the past weeks, which has resulted in an average\n \nblock size\n\n of about 700 kilobytes (0.7 megabyte). That is still below the maximum of 1 megabyte, but that is to be expected; for various reasons some miners produce some of their blocks well below the maximum capacity.\n\nAre fees rising?\n\nYes and no.\n\nThe\n \naverage transaction fee\n\n has been relatively stable over the past weeks. However, this is mostly because users (or their wallets) refrain from paying a higher fee, even though that would shorten the time for their transaction to confirm.\n\nUnfortunately, statistics on the average fee required to have a transaction confirmed in the very next block are currently unavailable. But over the past week the\n \naverage fee required\n\n to have a transaction included in the next \ntwo\n blocks has increased from 140 bits to about 200 bits.\n\nAre confirmation times increasing?\n\nYes.\n\nAverage confirmation times have\n \nincreased\n\n quite a bit. Transactions were previously included in blocks within some 12 minutes on average. At the height of the price spike, transactions took an average of about 30 minutes to confirm.\n\n(Of course, as explained above, users who want to be relatively sure their transaction is included in the next block can opt to pay a higher fee.)\n\nIs the memory pool building up?\n\nNo.\n\nWell, not to problematic levels, that is. Of course, the memory pool \u2013 consisting of\n \nunconfirmed transactions\n\n waiting to be included in a block \u2013 is building up in between blocks. That is how Bitcoin is designed, and happens regardless of how full blocks are.\n\nBut so far, the memory pool has not been building up to unusual levels, and has been much larger in the past.\n\nAre nodes dropping of the network?\n\nNo.\n\nOn average, there are no\n \nnodes\n\n dropping of the network. Over the past week, the number of full nodes has been stable at around 5,500. And this number has even risen a bit over the past couple of days.\n\nAre double spends increasing?\n\nUnknown.\n\nUnfortunately, there are no reliable statistics available concerning the amount of attempted double spends by users who believe their transactions take too long to confirm. The only statistics that come close concern the number of\n \nfailed transactions\n.\n These appear to be very high, but that is mainly because of the ongoing\n \ntransaction malleability attack\n.\n As such, the statistics on actual double spends are skewed, and cannot be trusted.\n\nAre users leaving?\n\nProbably not.\n\nWhile it is practically impossible to know for sure whether some users are disappointed in Bitcoin's performance and leave completely, it seems unlikely for now.\n\nSave for a slight increase of confirmation times (or required fees), Bitcoin is performing quite well. Moreover, \n\nvolume on exchanges\n\n is huge and, based on the increased exchange rate, it seems fair to assume that more new users want to get in rather than out.\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite some alarming forum posts, tweets and other reports, the spike in bitcoin's exchange rate has so far not caused any serious capacity problems for the Bitcoin network.\n\nOf course, this does not disprove Hearn's theory, and does not in itself mean there is no reason for concern. If bitcoin's surge maintains, and if volume on the network continues to grow, this \nmight\n still lead to complications at a later stage.\n\nBut so far, all is well on Bitcoin's blockchain.\n\nThanks to\n \nBlocktrail\n\n \nCTO Ruben de Vries for providing additional statistics.", "year": 2015, "month": 11, "day": 5}

(tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe block size dispute, perhaps the first ever real political controversy within the Bitcoin community, has raged for years, with no clear long-term solution in sight. \n\n\nSeven relevant BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) have been submitted that could increase the maximum block size in order to allow for more transactions on the Bitcoin network, and alternative Bitcoin implementation Bitcoin XT is even attempting a blockchain fork to increase the limit. \n\n\nBut none of the proposed solutions seem to be gathering enough support to establish a new consensus. And even if a consensus is to be found before the end of the year, as\n \ndesired\n\n by prominent industry leaders, it will most likely be a temporary solution designed to win some time.\n\n\n\nHowever, there is some light at the end of the tunnel as far as long-term solutions go. So-called flexcaps, in particular, are favored by a significant segment of the development community. And at least one such a solution is submitted for consideration at the\n \nScaling Bitcoin\n\n workshop in Hong Kong next month.\n\n\n\nWhat are flexcaps and why are they needed?\n\n\nFlexcaps are, as the name suggests, flexible caps on the block size. As opposed to hard limits \u2013 1MB, 8MB, programmed growth, a voted maximum, etc. \u2013 flexcaps allow each block to vary in size, determined by the miner who mines the block.\n\n\nExplaining why this might be a useful, Bitcoin Core developer and one of the flexcap \nauctor intellectualis'\n Gregory Maxwell told \nBitcoin Magazine:\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecific limits are almost always politically unstable. No one loves the particular number, whether it's maximum immigration numbers, or limits on rent, or minimum wages... Even if people agree on the fundamentals of the trade-off, very few agree on the particular number that is set. The number stays where it is only because of constant political battling. In the case of Bitcoin, moreover, strict limits on the maximum block size don't handle boost activity well. Short periods of time where for whatever reason the number of transactions on the Bitcoin network rises significantly, might cause problems at each pre-set limit.\n\n\nIn a post on\n \nBitcointalk\n,\n mathematician and Bitcoin expert Meni Rosenfeld explained that he \u2013 like Bitcoin XT developer\n \nMike Hearn\n\n \u2013 expects the Bitcoin network to crash if transactions systematically fill up blocks. But unlike Hearn, Rosenfeld believes the main problem is not so much the size of blocks themselves. Instead, Rosenfeld sees the fact that the Bitcoin network cannot handle full blocks all too well as the real problem, which is why he suggested a flexcap (\u201celastic cap\u201d), too.\n\n\n\n\u201c[I]f Bitcoin can't gracefully degrade in the face of rising transaction volume, we will have problems no matter what the current block size limit is,\u201d Rosenfeld explained. \u201cWe should instead focus on fixing \nthat \nproblem.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe proposed solution, therefore, is to allow miners to increase the limit on blocks they mine \u2013 but at a cost. By effectively charging miners for the creation of bigger blocks, there is an incentive for these miners to keep blocks smaller. Meanwhile, miners have the option to scrape up additional mining fees by (temporarily) creating bigger blocks. If the additional fees are worth more that the additional cost, it makes sense to increase size of a particular block.\n\n\nThese opposing incentives should result in a balance, a block size that is acceptable to developers, miners, users, and other network participants \u2013 at least in theory.\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n\nFlexcaps can be realized in several ways, with no fundamental difference between the different approaches. Whether to use one or the other is mostly a matter of personal preference, and it seems unlikely to cause great controversy.\n\n\nThe most basic type of flexcap was proposed by Rosenfeld. In Rosenfeld's design, miners will need to pay a \u201cfine\u201d if they increase the size of their block. More specifically, a cut is taken out of their block reward. Instead of 25 freshly minted bitcoin, for example, they would receive only 24, or 20, or whatever the protocol dictates depending on the size of that block. And to prevent that the remaining bitcoin are lost forever, they are paid to the miner who finds the next block; a \u201crollover fee.\u201d\n\n\nMaxwell's flexcap design has a similar goal as Rosenfeld's: increasing the cost of creating bigger blocks \u2013 but achieves it in a different manner. Rather than cutting into the block reward, Maxwell's flexcap design requires miners to mine at a higher difficulty level. If a miner wants to a create block 10 percent bigger than the norm, it needs to \u201cpay\u201d for that by mining the block at an increased difficulty, in effect needing to invest more energy (hence, money) on hashing.\n\n\nIt should be noted that neither solution would really solve the \nproblem\n\n of over-sized blocks. They would, however, counter one possible attack on the Bitcoin network. Since bigger blocks favor bigger miners (presumably pools), any block size policy that allows miners to increase the block size incentivises big miners to do so; in effect centralizing the mining ecosystem. This includes any policy where the block size is adjusted on the basis of previous blocks, since miners can send themselves transactions for free, allowing them to create artifically big blocks and game the system.\n\n\n\nBecause flexcaps include a cost to increase the block size, the system cannot be gamed for free. After all, even if miners send themselves transactions, they still need to pay the flexcap \u201cfine\u201d for increasing the block size.\n\n\n\u201cThe problem [of big blocks] remains, but users would have to pay fees to support it, Maxwell explained. \u201cMiners can't drive other miners off the network without actual activity in it. Miners can pay fees to themselves, but the cost they can't pay to themselves is the higher difficulty of decreased block reward. They have to do more work to produce a block.\u201d\n\n\nIt should be noted, however, that one remaining attack would be an \u201cinvestment attack.\u201d Big miners with deep enough pockets could pay the price for increasing the block size over a long period of time, simply to get rid of smaller competitors in order to gain a larger profit later on. While unlikely, this might still be a profitable strategy.\n\n\nLimits and parameters\n\n\nFlexcaps will not completely remove the need for limits on the block size. Most importantly, they still require a default maximum, above which a miner is \u201cfined\u201d one way or another. So how are these limits set?\n\n\nIn short: Setting default limits is not a problem flexcaps solve in and of themselves. But flexcaps can be combined with all sorts of other block increase proposals. Whether these are hard limits, or growing limits, or voted limits of any sort, a flexcap can typically be added \u201con top.\u201d\n\n\nOne such solution is submitted to be presented at the Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Hong Kong by Bitcoin Core developer Mark Friedenbach. Friedenbach's proposal uses a play on Rosenfeld's rollover fee system, but with an added advantage for miners who prefer to create smaller blocks \u2013 which, among other advantages, could counter an investment attack.\n\n\nSpeaking to \nBitcoin Magazine,\n Friedenbach explained:\n\n\n\nRather than simply gift the foregone subsidy to some future miner, the flexcap proposal I am working on would require the future miner to constrain the block they are working on to a smaller size in order to claim the held funds. If a miner creates a slightly larger block by claiming only 24 bitcoin, the next miner can create a slightly smaller block and claim 26 bitcoin.\n\n\nIn Friedenbach\u2019s proposal, the default block limit is based on the size of previous blocks. While the parameters of this proposal are not set in stone yet, the network might take the median block size of the past two weeks, and set that number as the default limit for the next two weeks.\n\n\n\u201cBy allowing and providing incentive for the block size to adjust both up and down as demand requires, we can ensure that the block size remains tied to the demands of users via the fee market,\u201d Friedenbach explained. \u201cThis is really about making the fee market set the block size. It\n is the users who are voting with their money. Since there is a cost to raising the block size, rational miners will only do so if they are compensated with fees. So users who are willing to pay a sufficient fee, are in effect voting for a higher block size.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe End of Politics?\n\n\nIn an ideal scenario, the limits and \u2013 perhaps more importantly \u2013 parameters used in a flexcap solution follow more or less naturally from experimentation and testing. However, the fact that limits or parameters need to be selected by humans means it still involves some level of politics.\n\n\nRather than removing politics completely, flexcap proponents hope that this solution could allow the Bitcoin network to release some steam when under pressure. This could solve the problem of oversaturation to great extent, which in turn might prevent the debate itself from overheating as much as it did in the past.\n\n\n\u201cThe flexcap should be combined with a hard limit, but we can be much more giving with these hard limits,\u201d Maxwell said. \u201cThey can be bigger, allowed to grow faster, and made easier to change. Flexcaps make the situation more politically stable.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWith [flexcaps] in place, we no longer run the risk of a crash landing, only rising fees \u2013 giving us an indication that something should be changed,\u201d Rosenfeld said. \u201cAnd then, we can go back to arguing what the block size should be, given the trade-off above.\u201d\n\n", "year": 2015, "month": 11, "day": 5}

Because of this, the ETNs offer investors worldwide the opportunity to invest in bitcoin.\u00a0 Every share of the ETN represents 0.05 BTC. Over the past few days, and yesterday in particular, the trading volume and price for Bitcoin Tracker One have increased significantly.\u00a0\nWhile these ETNs have been trading approximately 650-750 bitcoin per day, on November 3rd, the exchanges saw 2,688 bitcoin traded.

Instead, institutional investors can use the tools and markets they are trading on every day and purchase bitcoin just like a stock or commodity. Buying shares of GBTC or what XBT Provider offers is as simple as buying a share of Apple.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe block-size limit dispute, at its heart, represents a trade-off between efficiency and security. Bigger blocks allow for more transactions on the Bitcoin network but could reduce mining power utilization and lead to centralization. Engulfed in sometimes heated debates, several developers have submitted proposals to strike a right balance between the two and reach community consensus \u2013 but so far to no avail.\n\nA group of Cornell University researchers, meanwhile, took an entirely different approach. Instead of attempting to strike the right balance, post-doctoral associate Ittay Eyal, doctoral student Adem Efe Gencer, computer science professor Emin G\u00fcn Sirer and research scientist Robbert Van Renesse, \nproposed\n\n Bitcoin NG, a radical redesign of the Bitcoin architecture meant to solve the block size trade-off entirely.\n\nOn key blocks\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin miners include two main types of data in blocks: a proof of work which allows the network to determine the longest chain, and a number of transactions to be selected by the miner. As its main differentiator, Bitcoin NG splits these two functions by creating two separate types of blocks: key blocks and microblocks, both of which are still part of the same chain.\n\nKey blocks include the proof of work, a reference to the previous block, and the coinbase transaction (mining reward) \u2013 but none of the other transactions. In Bitcoin NG's current design, and much like \u201cnormal\u201d Bitcoin blocks, key blocks are found every 10 minutes on average. And, also like \u201cnormal\u201d Bitcoin blocks, the amount of hashing power used to find the block determines the longest chain. In other words, it determines which blockchain is the real one.\n\nTo explain the benefits of using key blocks, Eyal told \nBitcoin Magazine:\n\n\nSince key blocks don't include any transactions, they require very little data to be transmitted over the network. This results in faster block propagation, and, therefore, in fewer pruned blocks ['orphans']. As such, less mining power is wasted, and the incentive to centralize mining is reduced.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOn microblocks\n\nApart from the proof of work, a reference to the previous block, and the coinbase transaction, a miner includes one more type of data in a key block: his own public key. Subsequently, the corresponding private key is required to sign the other type of blocks: microblocks.\n\nAs opposed to key blocks, microblocks do not include any proof of work, but merely store transactions. These microblocks are created much more often: on average once every 10 seconds in Bitcoin NG's initial design. As such, the miner of a key block is essentially in charge of confirming transactions on the network until a new key block is found.\n\nOn poison transactions\n\nThere is one problem. The fact that microblocks are not secured by proof of work, means a miner (the key block signer) could easily double spend a transaction; he can simply sign multiple microblocks with contradicting transactions to different entities at the same time.\n\nTherefore, Bitcoin NG uses so-called \u201cpoison transactions.\u201d If the network notices a double spend, a poison transaction is created, which destroys the revenue \u2013 the mining reward and fees \u2013 of the double spending miner retroactively. As such, miners are incentivized to remain honest.\n\n\nTransactions included in a microblock on the Bitcoin NG blockchain would be much more reliable than unconfirmed transactions on the current Bitcoin blockchain,\u201d says Eyal. \u201cBut microblocks would not offer the same level of security as key blocks. Only key blocks would offer a similar level of security as blocks on the current blockchain do, meaning it would still be wise to wait for several confirmations when the value of a transaction is significant.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nRadical\n\nCompared to alternative proposals circulating that address the scaling issue. Bitcoin NG is probably the most radical redesign of the Bitcoin protocol as we know it today. By basically flipping the current process of Bitcoin mining on its head, the Cornell research team has proposed an alternative that is completely incompatible with the existing consensus rules. Whether Bitcoin NG actually has any type of future, therefore, remains to be seen.\n\n\nThere are several ways where this could go,\u201d Eyal explained. \u201cWe could reach a consensus among the Bitcoin community to change the way the blockchain works, and implement Bitcoin NG to be the new Bitcoin. Or, if someone is inclined to implement all the technical differences, Bitcoin NG could become an altcoin. Personally, I'm interested in the technology and the science behind it, as a research project. I think this is a better way to do a blockchain.\u201d\n\nFor more information on Bitcoin NG, see Eyal and Sirer\u2019s blog post on \nHacking, Distributed.\n\n", "year": 2015, "month": 11, "day": 9}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nThe idea of a social media platform with Bitcoin-powered financial incentives has become rather popular ever since former \nReddit\n\n Cryptocurrency Engineer \nRyan X. Charles\n\n \nwrote\n\n about how Bitcoin could be used to solve some of Reddit\u2019s core issues earlier this year. \n\nAlthough many believed that this new social media application would be nothing more than a copy of Reddit with a few Bitcoin-centric features added to it, Charles recently \ntold an audience\n\n at an \nSF Bitcoin Meetup\n\n that the final product could look quite different from the \u201cFrontpage of the Internet.\u201d Instead of an alternative to Reddit, it appears that Charles\u2019s creation, \nDatt\n,\n will be a completely new kind of experience.\n\nBitcoin Attached to Upvotes\n\nDuring his recent presentation, Charles displayed a few mockups of what Datt could look like when it\u2019s ready for some sort of public release. The examples shown in his \npresentation slides\n looked quite similar to Reddit, but Charles noted that the functionality associated with upvoting and downvoting worked a bit differently:\n\nThis is an example of the front page. It looks similar to Reddit -- you see links, you see images -- with one difference being those little dots you can see on the left. When you press that dot, when you highlight the dot, that\u2019s the same thing as like upvoting on Reddit, but you\u2019re actually paying the person bitcoin. So, you\u2019re giving them a little bitcoin tip. You can think of it -- it\u2019s sort of if \nChangeTip\n\n were integrated to a website or if \nZapchain\n\n looked like Reddit, it would look like this.\n\nFeatures, Storage, and Onename Integration\n\nOf course, Datt is not just about cloning Reddit and attaching bitcoin to upvotes. There will be other features added to the system, which could make the platform a bit more dynamic. For example, Charles noted that there could be some features that are similar to what is found on Twitter:\n\nThere will probably be following, like Twitter, so it won\u2019t be exactly the same as Reddit.\n\nCharles also wanted to make the point that a user does not need to have any bitcoin to use Datt:\n\nYou do not need to have bitcoin to do anything. That\u2019s another question -- people ask about this a lot . . . You don\u2019t have to have bitcoin to view content or to post content. It\u2019s sort of a feature, but you don\u2019t have to have it.\n\nWith this being an open-source project with the promise of decentralization, it makes sense that user data and content will not be stored on a centralized server owned by Datt. Charles noted that \nIPFS\n\n or another P2P protocol where each user is able to store data related to the subreddits (or whatever Datt communities are called) they\u2019re interested in could be used for storing content, while \nOnename\n\n will likely be used to solve the identity problem.\n\nHow Will Datt Be Monetized?\n\nIn addition to explaining how Datt will work as an application, Charles also spent some time discussing how a profitable business could be built around the platform. He sees monetization as a non-issue, and he thinks taking a cut of each transaction made on Datt could be a business model that works over the short term:\n\nTo me, this is a non-issue. I think it\u2019s very obvious -- we will just take a portion of payments. Almost no one is going to modify the client to take out that portion. It\u2019s technically optional, but we\u2019ll just take a cut of the payments. I think that will work; we\u2019ll see.\n\nCharles pointed to \nOB1\n\n (the company behind \nOpenBazaar)\n as an example of an alternative business plan, but it\u2019s clear that he will try monetize the protocol first:\n\nThere are other ways we could earn money. We could provide services [like what OB1 plans to do. OB1] is going to do more like creating other products and services, not so much monetizing the protocol. I\u2019m trying to monetize the protocol. When people make payments on this thing, a cut goes to the company by default. At least, that\u2019s the plan.\n\n\nIt\u2019s still somewhat difficult to imagine what Datt will look like when it\u2019s released to the public \nearly next year,\n and an early prototype release in November could help Charles and the rest of the development team figure out which direction to move in next.

Bitcoin is considered as far too open and anarchic to be a suitable foundation for a solid financial system.\n\nJeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of digital financial service provider and \u201cbitcoin bank\u201d Circle,\nhas written a thoughtful analysis\nof the blockchain vs. bitcoin issue on Re/code.\n\n\n\u201cIf bitcoin is referenced, it\u2019s dismissively, as if smart people are in the know that bitcoin (the digital asset) isn\u2019t necessary or important to fueling this global network of distributed and decentralized trust,\u201d says Allaire. \u201cFor the most part, it\u2019s just a cop-out and intellectual laziness; I have yet to meet anyone who shares these thoughts who actually has any idea how any of the technology actually works.\u201d\n\nAllaire notes that the troublesome features of Bitcoin \u2013 its openness to everyone and its lack of centralized control \u2013 are exactly what make the Internet work. The success of the Internet and the failure of all the closed, regulated versions of the Internet that have been implemented, should suggest that openness is necessary for a robust blockchain system to work.\n\nIn many recent articles, Bitcoin Magazine\nreported the trend toward private, \u201cpermissioned\u201d non-Bitcoin blockchains, supported by Accenture and Digital Asset Holdings CEO Blythe Masters .\u00a0\n\n\nPermissioned blockchains, under development by giant Swiss bank UBS , Bitcoin exchange itBit and others, would offer the advantages of digital currencies powered by public blockchains \u2013 fast and cheap transactions permanently recorded in a shared ledger \u2013 without the troublesome openness of the Bitcoin network where anyone can be a node on the network anonymously.\u00a0\n\nInstead of anonymous miners, only banks and vetted financial operators would be allowed to validate transactions in permissioned blockchains.\n\n\nAllaire notes that \u201cthey want all the benefits of bitcoin, without bitcoin,\u201d and asks, \u201cDo we really think that financial industry consortia and alt-chain startups can challenge the open Internet? Does anyone really think these 'permissioned blockchains' have an iota of a chance at accomplishing anything more than building buggy, insecure closed back-end IT systems for banks?\u201d\n\n\u201c[Until] someone actually builds, ships and scales a global open platform, open like the rest of the Internet, that can do what the bitcoin blockchain can today, there\u2019s really nothing else to talk about,\u201d is Allaire\u2019s conclusion.\u00a0\n\nLike Allaire, legendary cryptographer Nick Szabo thinks\nthat the mainstream financial establishment should embrace the crowd-sourced power and resiliency of permissionless blockchains like Bitcoin.\n\nAllaire notes that bitcoin shouldn\u2019t be considered as a new currency, but as a more efficient settlement network.\u00a0\n\n\nMost people don\u2019t want a new currency, they are quite happy with their dollars, euro, pound, yuan and yen,\u201d says Allaire. \u201cThey get paid in these currencies, they pay their taxes in these currencies, they understand their purchasing power in these currencies, etc. But, pretty uniformly, people want the benefits of bitcoin and the blockchain: near-instant transfers, globally available on any Internet-connected device, highly secure and nearly free value transfers.\u201d\n\nServices that use the bitcoin blockchain as a transparent channel for value transfers, for example cross-border transactions where a fiat currency is spent at one end and another fiat currency is paid at the other, are emerging.\u00a0\n\n\nWe can hide bitcoin technology in the background,\u201d noted Jack Liu, head of international at OKCoin, Bitcoin Magazine\nreported\nin October. \u201cLiu added that OKLink\ntransactions aren\u2019t affected by the volatility of bitcoin. \u201cBecause you are doing instant buy of bitcoin and sell of bitcoin, you are not affected by the bitcoin price,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201c[Consumers and businesses] can share value globally and instantly for free, by using the bitcoin blockchain as an open and secure ledger and settlement network,\u201d notes Allaire. \u201cFor the duration of a transfer, local currencies are converted into and out of \u2018digital tokens,\u2019 and the transaction is settled over the Internet.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Circle started offering customers in the United States the ability to hold their funds in U.S. dollars, which could be followed by similar offerings in other countries and permit transparent, cheap, fast bitcoin-mediated transfer between one currency and another.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 11, "day": 10}

It is generally regarded as the most prestigious award for that field.\n\n\u201cThe committee has invited me to nominate someone for the 2016 Prize,\u201d writes\nChowdhry in The Huffington Post.\n\u201cI then started thinking whose ideas are likely to have a disruptive influence in the twenty first century. The name of the inventor of Bitcoin suddenly jumped up in my consciousness and I have not been able to get it out of my mind since then, Satoshi Nakamoto.\u201d\n\nWill Satoshi Nakamoto, the Inventor of #Bitcoin, Win the 2016 #NobelPrize in Economics? https://t.co/NhTErS6iM9\u2014 Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) November 9, 2015\n\n\u201cThe invention of bitcoin \u2013 a digital currency \u2013 is nothing short of revolutionary,\u201d continues Chowdhry. \u201c[Bitcoin] is digital and exists purely as a mathematical object. It offers many advantages over both physical and paper currencies. It is secure, relying on almost unbreakable cryptographic code, can be divided into millions of smaller sub-units, and can be transferred securely and nearly instantaneously from one person to any other person in the world with access to internet bypassing governments, central banks and financial intermediaries such as Visa, Mastercard, Paypal or commercial banks eliminating time delays and transactions costs.\u201d\n\nOf course, Chowdhry is aware that the Nobel Committee is unlikely to accept the nomination of a pseudonymous candidate. That\u2019s why the article\u2019s title is \u201cI (Shall Happily) Accept the 2016 Nobel Prize in Economics on Behalf of Satoshi Nakamoto.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no real precedent for awarding the Nobel Prize to an unknown person (or possibly even group of people), so it\u2019s difficult to say how the Prize committee will deal with the nomination,\u201d notes\nGizmodo.\n\u201cBut even so, the fact that Bitcoin and Nobel Prize in Economics are being talked about in the same breath is significant all on its own.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would be happy to go and accept the Prize on [Nakamoto\u2019s]\u00a0 behalf,\u201d says Chowdhry. \u201cWhat about the acceptance speech? That won't be any problem either. He can write his speech, digitally sign it and send it to me securely. I would, of course, rehearse and deliver it on his behalf at the Prize ceremony.\u201d\n\nEven so, it still seems unlikely that the Nobel Committee will accept the nomination. But it\u2019s interesting to imagine that Nakamoto could choose this moment to reveal his identity, which would force the Committee to accept his nomination and take it seriously. As Chowdhry notes, Satoshi is so rich that the financial reward wouldn\u2019t matter much \u2013 he is still sitting on a huge stash of bitcoin that he could sell anytime \u2013 but the temptation of joining the very select club of Nobel Laureates is difficult to resist. If Satoshi ever chooses to disclose his identity, now seems like a very appropriate time.\n\nThat Satoshi Nakamoto deserves a Nobel Prize is difficult to deny. As Chowdhry notes, bitcoin as a currency and an efficient payment means is just the tip of the iceberg. The disruptively innovative nature of Bitcoin lies in the possibility of decentralized trustless agreements and digital contracts that can be digitized, securely verified and stored, and transferred instantaneously from one party to another.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe implications of this are immense,\u201d says Chowdhry, and adds that Bitcoin is likely to upend the role central banks play in conducting monetary policy. \u201cThe consumers will be big beneficiaries and indeed the poor and marginal sections of the society will reap the benefits of financial and social inclusion in the coming decades,\u201d he says.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that Satoshi Nakamoto might have already received the Nobel Prize in Economics. In fact, the rumors that the unknown identity behind Satoshi could be\nthe mathematician John Nash\nof A Beautiful Mind\n\n\nfame, who received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1994, never quite died out. Nash, who openly proposed many ideas for next-generation economics that can be related to Bitcoin and considered as precursors, for example the Ideal Money concept, passed away in May 2015.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 11, "day": 9}

Our use of cash is small and it\u2019s decreasing rapidly,\u201d \nsaid Arvidsson.\n\n\nSix years ago, the total circulation of cash in the entire country recorded 106 billion krona, around 40 percent to 50 percent more than today\u2019s \u201cregular cash circulation.\u201d\n\n\"And out of that amount, only somewhere between 40 and 60 percent is actually in regular circulation,\" Arvidsson continued. He further explained that rest of the money is lost in bank deposit boxes or traded in the black markets of Sweden.\n\nAs a result, a growing number of economists and banks including the Swedish Central bank are trying to create a completely cash-free society, wherein all transactions and payments are settled digitally, using various means of payments and financial services.\n\n\u201cWalking the streets of Sweden's second city, Gothenburg, it's almost impossible to find a shop that doesn't accept bank cards for payment, and most locals tend to carry no coins or notes on their person. Many also make use of an app called Swish, a collaboration between Swedish and Danish banks that permits fast, simple money transfers on smartphones,\u201d said Duncan Geere of \ntechradar.\n\n\nArvidsson also claimed that some bank branches refuse to accept cash and, if they do, the banks require a detailed report of information and evidences that could prove the origin of the cash. For example, if the cash was acquired in a bitcoin exchange by selling small amount of BTC in a series of transactions, customers may have to provide each transaction history and its threads to validate the nature of the transactions.\n\nThe majority of well-established financial institutions are worried about involvement in money laundering and fraud, especially for digital currencies like bitcoin which has been involved in various court cases and scams like Josh Garza\u2019s Paycoin and GAW Miners.\n\n\"At the offices which do handle banknotes and coins, the customer must explain where the cash comes from, according to the regulations aimed at money laundering and terrorist financing,\" explained Arvidsson. Bank staff are required to file police reports in response to suspicious cash transactions.\n\nAt this point in time, the central bank and self-titled economists are eagerly searching for alternative payment methods that could potentially replace cash and transform Sweden into a cash-free economy and society.\n\nRecently, Sweden\u2019s largest stock exchange Nasdaq \napproved XBT Provider AB\n to launch industry-grade bitcoin tracker on the Nasdaq stock exchange, which is designed to mirror the price of U.S. dollars per bitcoin. \n\n\nAlthough the central bank and economists of Sweden are yet to come to a consensus as to which financial instruments and methods of payment could potentially replace the country\u2019s currency, Swedish financial institutions will continue to focus on providing digital products and monetary services to reduce the regular circulation of fiat money.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 10, "day": 19}

(tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitPay\n,\n one of the\n \ntop funded\n\n companies and\n \nmost-used\n\n payment processor in the Bitcoin industry, is open to alternative block-size proposals \u2013 not just BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) 101. \n\nSpeaking to \nBitcoin Magazine,\n CEO Stephen Pair reaffirmed that BitPay will adopt code to increase Bitcoin's block-size limit by December of this year, but said this no longer needs to be the proposal as implemented in alternative Bitcoin implementation Bitcoin XT.\n\nBIP 101 is programmed to increase the block-size limit to 8 megabytes, then doubling every other year for the next 20 years. This proposal was publicly endorsed through an\n \nopen letter\n\n from some of the leading Bitcoin companies in the space last summer. \n\nBitPay, Blockchain(.info), Circle, KnCMiner, Bitnet, Xapo, BitGo and itBit vowed to adopt BIP 101 and ready their code for bigger blocks by December. Additionally, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong made a similar\n \nstatement\n\n on Twitter earlier this week.\n\nBut when asked by \nBitcoin Magazine,\n Pair indicated that BIP 101 is no longer the only option for the leading payment processor in the Bitcoin space. The BitPay CEO explained that alternative proposals will be considered as well.\n\n\u201cIn December we will adopt the leading candidate solution, which right now is BIP 101, but that could change. This will hopefully help drive consensus,\u201d Pair said.\n\nAs one possible alternative, Pair referred to a \ntemporary solution\n\n that would increase the maximum blocks size to 8 MB over a four-year period:\n\n\u201c[Blockstream president] Adam Back made a proposal that is essentially the same as BIP 101, but has a less steep curve that doesn't stretch as far into the future. I prefer that proposal over BIP 101, but I'm not sure it will be ready by December.\u201d\n\nDrawing from his experience in the telecom industry, Pair sees a lot of opportunity to improve Bitcoin's efficiency and scalability by reducing resource usage. This would, in turn, decrease the risk of bigger blocks, which is why Pair believes an increase of the block-size limit is the best way forward.\n\n\u201cEither extreme on block size puts Bitcoin at risk. But I don't believe that a moderately larger block size will result in centralization because people can no longer afford to run full nodes,\u201d Pair said.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, a block size that is too small would result in fewer people being able to afford transactions. If only a few people use bitcoin for transactions, those people will eventually realize that they could conduct those transactions much more cheaply by compromising on decentralization.\u201d\n\nThe Bitcoin community has been arguing if, when, and how to increase the maximum block size in order to allow for more transactions on the network for several years. The debate reached a climax in August of this year, when former Bitcoin Core lead developer Gavin Andresen and Bitcoinj developer Mike Hearn\n \nimplemented BIP 101\n\n in alternative Bitcoin implementation Bitcoin XT. Bitcoin XT has so far\n \nnot garnered\n\n the required 75 percent hash-rate support among miners in order to activate, however.\n\nWhile this makes an ecosystemwide adoption of Bitcoin XT seem unlikely, Pair did make it very clear that the maximum block size should be increased by December somehow.\n\n\u201cFrom our vantage point, we are quickly running out of time,\u201d Pair said. \u201cBitcoin is at all-time highs regarding transaction volume, and BitPay has been setting new monthly transaction volume records every month for the last six months. We are starting to see Bitcoin used to solve very boring problems by people who could care less whether it's bitcoin or not. This to me is an early indicator that a tipping point is near. Hopefully, we find a consensus that doesn't put Bitcoin's lead as the most secure and liquid payment medium in jeopardy.\u201d\n\nAnother proposal that has been gaining in popularity, and that was drafted by Bitcoin Core developer and BitPay employee Jeff Garzik, is\n \nBIP 100\n.\n BIP 100 would allow miners to collectively vote on the block-size limit, and is currently publicly endorsed by\n \n60 percent\n\n of all hashing power on the Bitcoin network.\n\nAlthough the proposal was drafted by one of his employees (but not on behalf of his company), Pair is not convinced BIP 100 is the best way forward.\n\n\u201cI like the idea of a formalized consensus regarding the block-size limit built into the protocol, much like consensus regarding difficulty,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would have done it a bit differently than BIP 100. I also favor simplicity over complexity. Complex rules and processes bring additional risk. While there might be a debate about BIP 101's growth curve, it is a much simpler solution than BIP 100. In my opinion BIP 100 is too risky, and support or lack thereof from the mining community won't change that view.\"\n", "year": 2015, "month": 10, "day": 21}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nIt was announced earlier this week that a significant group of prominent Bitcoin companies, individuals and institutions have united in a \u201cBlockchain Alliance.\u201d This alliance will serve as a resource for law enforcement to help combat criminal activity involving bitcoin and the blockchain, and has so far engaged with the Department of Justice (including the FBI and the U.S. Marshals Service), the U.S. Secret Service, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security Investigations and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nHowever, the Blockchain Alliance was not welcomed by the entire community.\nOne of the fiercest opponents of the initiative has been Bitcoin Foundation Executive Director Bruce Fenton. Shortly after the Blockchain Alliance was announced, Fenton took to Internet\nforums\nand Twitter\nto voice his concern about the industry\u2019s outreach to law enforcement.\nSpeaking to  Bitcoin Magazine, Fenton explained why:\nBitcoin's relative anonymity has obviously led to it being used for criminal purposes. Don't you consider that a problem that needs solving?\n\nFirst off, I challenge the notion that the American government has an absolute and irrefutable right to know all financial information and private records of every person within our borders. This is a relatively new idea, and it's a very bad one. Some things are just not their business, and the fact that I'm a little afraid to say that out loud shows how sad our current state is.\nAs for criminal activity, note that something being a crime is not always a measure of morality. In some countries right now being gay is a criminal act. Even in the United States we once had segregation mandated by law. \u201cAiding a runaway slave\u201d was once a crime... Would we have wanted to \u201cpartner with law enforcement\u201d to track the blockchain for purchases made by escaped slaves?\nToday we have laws related to asset forfeiture and federal prosecution of crimes which voters in states decided to decriminalize. These are actions by law enforcement that many citizens feel are immoral.\nBut Bitcoin can\n\nalso be used for criminal purposes that we probably all agree are undesirable. Extortion comes to mind.\n\nSure, Bitcoin makes some bad things easier to do -- just as do shoes, phones and the Internet. But it's unwise to punish technology and innovation rather than the actual harmful actors.\nThe Blockchain Alliance is established exactly to help law enforcers make this distinction...\n\nBut taking care of these bad actors is the responsibility of the law enforcers, not that of the innovations or the industry. Cars make it far easier for criminals to escape than by foot, but the technology of the motor vehicle and its industry has no responsibility for this.\nThe job of innovators is to innovate, not to catch those whom the state deems criminal. The job of law enforcement is to deal with new technology as best they can without harming or interfering in the lives of peaceful people who have harmed no other.\nThe Blockchain Alliance has no intention to conduct blockchain analysis, blacklisting, or anything like that. It's just a forum where law enforcement can ask questions. Why do you consider this such a big deal?\n\nWould the Blockchain Alliance be willing to put in writing a set of conditions under which they would break off ties with law enforcement? If not, then their stated intent is worthless.\nEssentially every time any industry has had experiences with government which turned out to be destructive, it started with good intent. The Bitcoin community's engagement with the New York Department of Financial Services, and the resulting BitLicense, is actually a good example of that.\nThese government organizations have poor track records and continually seek to expand authority. We even have blatant violations of the Constitution such as those of the NSA exposed by Edward Snowden. The very same agencies who seek to capture Snowden are now partners of the Blockchain Alliance...\nLaw enforcement will, eventually, figure Bitcoin out with or without the Bitcoin Alliance. Why not help them in the process, and build up some goodwill among regulators?\n\nThe job of law enforcement is not to figure new things out, not to be our friend, not to determine right or wrong, nor even to craft new laws or listen to logic -- but to follow orders. Even if these orders flow from protectionist laws created by corrupt bureaucrats. And even if the banks and other special interests push for laws giving them a further competitive advantage over Bitcoin.\nWhat about Bitcoin's image problem? Bitcoin is often seen as the currency for criminals, at least among many regulators...\n\nWe seem to forget that this is our country. The regulators are supposed to work for us. I challenge the notion that they are \u201cserving the public\u201d here, unless they can produce evidence that a large number of public citizens are concerned about Bitcoin technology. They aren't. No college students and grandmothers are lining up outside the doors of elected officials telling them that something must be done about \u201cthe scary blockchain.\u201d Citizens are much more concerned about jobs, innovation and a competitive economy.\nI believe we should first and foremost educate the public. Aside from educating citizens, we can also spend some effort educating lawmakers, preferably elected ones with some accountability rather than the unelected (Benjamin) Lawsky types.\nBut most importantly, we should take a page from the playbook of Uber and build something that's loved by millions... then when the fat wrinkled hands of bureaucrats are raised with a signal to stop, the public collectively shrugs and ignores them.\nAs Bitcoin becomes more popular, not in the least among criminals, the trend of more and stricter regulation will probably continue. If you care about privacy, fungibility, censorship resistance, and these sorts of things, wouldn't it make sense to focus on protocol-level solutions, rather than to fight regulation and law enforcement?\n\nDefinitely. The ultimate solutions are those of a technical nature. My goal in speaking about this is not to fight law enforcement or even regulation... but to simply question why it could make sense to work so hard to help law enforcement with a dubious mission.\nI respect the members of that group a lot, many are good friends. I hope I'm wrong and it turns out great. Meanwhile, let's all work together to build something amazing that changes our world for the better.\nPhoto Office of Public Affairs / Flickr (CC)\n", "year": 2015, "month": 10, "day": 30}

Most importantly, Bitcoin has proved to be a challange from a regulatory perspective, as regulators often require financial institutions to offer a level of accountability that Bitcoin cannot give them.\n\n\u201cPublic ledgers like Bitcoin have been problematic for financial institutions as transaction validation is delegated to a group of potentially unknown parties \u2013 the miners \u2013 while financial institutions are often legally required to vet every transaction going through them,\u201d Coinprism founder and CEO Flavien Charlon said in a statement. \u201cOpenchain has been designed with these requirements in mind, and offers full control on transaction validation.\u201d\n\nOpenchain allows each company or institution to deploy its own version of Openchain, for internal use. Within these companies or institutions, each level of the organization can transact on the corresponding level of their Openchain, using their unique digital signatures. \n\nAs such, higher levels within the organization have access to higher levels of the ledger, and are able to set permissions for lower levels. These lower levels, in turn, have access only to the lower levels of the ledger. \n\nThis, in effect, replicates the existing structure of an organization onto a blockchain-like system, while incorporating some of the advantages of blockchain technology such as transparency and auditability.\n\nAdditionally, Openchain allows different organizations to transact conceptually similar to how financial institutions currently conduct business. Essentially, several companies or institutions can set up mutual gateways through an API, connecting their Openchain ledgers. \n\nThis allows these organizations to create an account on the other Openchain, acting as a mutual liability. Once a transaction is validated by both parties, the accounts on both Openchain ledgers are adjusted simultaneously.\n\n\u201cOpenchain features a powerful hierarchical account system, a hybrid between a file system and a double-entry accounting system,\u201d Charlon said. \u201cThis lets the administrator of an Openchain instance define their business rules, such as anti-money laundering and know your customer regulation, by setting various permissions on accounts, with different levels of granularity.\u201d\n\nBecause the distributed permissioned ledger uses a simplified and trust-based consensus mechanism, it exceeds Bitcoin's capabilities on a technical level. While Bitcoin is currently limited to a handful of transactions per second, Openchain offers several orders of magnitude more transactions than that. On top of that, Openchain's transaction validation is virtually instant.\n\nMeanwhile, Openchain offers immutability by publishing \u201canchors\u201d into the main Bitcoin blockchain at regular intervals. It can then benefit from the security and irreversibility of Bitcoin while keeping transaction costs to a minimum.\n\n\u201cWhile proof of work is central to building a fully autonomous, decentralized currency such as Bitcoin, it actually becomes a burden when you start tokenizing assets,\u201d Charlon explained. \u201cWith Openchain, we have taken all the key characteristics of a Blockchain like immutability, auditability and programmability, but removed the legacy of proof of work. This allowed us to build an extremely efficient and scalable platform with no compromise.\u201d\n\nOpenchain open source and is now available on\n \nGitHub\n.\n Coinprism offers a test wallet at\n \nwallet.openchain.org\n\n for developers and curious users to start experimenting with it.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 10, "day": 20}

The program covers all areas of fintech, from cybersecurity and artificial intelligence to wealth management, investment banking, big data and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Accelerator program just concluded was the first to take place in New York.\nThe next 13-week program will take place in London in January 2016. Barclays announced two further Barclays Accelerator programs that will run in Tel Aviv and in Cape Town in March 2016.\n\nIn June, Bitcoin Magazine\nreported\nthat of the 10 firms taking in Barclays' 13-week Accelerator program in London seven were \"exploring opportunities\" with the bank.\u00a0 Barclays signed a deal with Safello, a Swedish company that participated in the fintech accelerator program in London, to explore how the blockchain could be used in traditional finance.\n\n\u201cAt Barclays, we\u2019re embracing the digital revolution, exploring innovations early on so that we can help to shape their development and co-create the future of financial services with these startups,\" said Barclays\u2019 chief design and digital officer Derek White. \u201cWe're leading the industry with new pioneering technologies, which will be paramount to helping us achieve our ambition of becoming the 'Go-To' bank.\"\n\nIn March, speaking at the Morgan Stanley European Financials Conference in London, Barclays\u2019 CEO Antony Jenkins warned that the \u201cbanking sector has not yet felt the \u2018full disruptive force\u2019 of technology \u2013 but it will.\u201d He elaborated on the growing concern among financial institutions that faster, cheaper payment systems will start to seduce their consumer and business customers in the coming years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to be part of the burgeoning fintech ecosystem in New York City and play an active part in the transformation of the industry,\u201d said Jenny Fielding,\nmanaging director of Techstars. \u201cThe eleven startups in this class are each tackling a different part of financial services, providing further evidence that the category is a massive market opportunity. Working in unison with Barclays has proven to be a strong partnership for these high-growth startups and we're excited to roll out additional fintech programs worldwide.\u201d\n\nTwo of the fintech companies selected by Barclays have a special focus on blockchain technology.\n\nBarclays\u2019 financial crime and transaction monitoring teams will be using Chainalysis\u2019 tools for in-depth real-time blockchain transaction analysis to obtain information from the blockchain about their customer\u2019s financial transactions. Chainalysis,\nbased in Switzerland, offers a service that provides financial institutions with the means to obtain regulatory compliance through real-time analysis of the blockchain.\u00a0\n\nIt is evident that Bitcoin is moving toward mainstreaming and regulations, and therefore services such Chainalysis are here to stay, but such services likely will continue to meet opposition from an important part of the Bitcoin community. In April Bitcoin Magazine\nreported\nthat a leaked Chainalysis roadmap, now trending on Reddit, has been received with anger and hostile comments.\n\nIn August, Bitcoin Magazine\nreported\nthat Barclays will be the first major bank to help selected customers \u2013 UK charities \u2013 to receive bitcoin payments directly in their bank accounts, establishing an important precedent. It can be expected that, after this first initiative focused on charities, Barclays could consider gradually allowing ordinary business and residential customers to receive bitcoin payments. In this context, Chainalysis\u2019 system could allow Barclays to discriminate good customers from bad customers in full compliance with applicable over-regulations.\n\nWave,\n a company that developed a peer-to-peer and completely decentralized network that connects all carriers, banks, forwarders, traders and other parties of the international trading supply chain, will experiment with blockchain-based tools to help business clients reduce costs associated with supply chain management in collaboration with Barclays\u2019 Corporate Bank.\u00a0\n", "year": 2015, "month": 10, "day": 21}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nA group of prominent Bitcoin companies and individuals under leadership of the\n Chamber of Digital Commerce\n\n and\n Coin Center\n\n have formed the\n Blockchain Alliance\n,\n a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit that will serve as a resource for law enforcement to help combat criminal activity involving bitcoin and the blockchain. \n\nThe Blockchain Alliance is so far engaged with the Department of Justice (including the FBI and the U.S. Marshals Service), the U.S. Secret Service, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security Investigations and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nThe Blockchain Alliance will serve as a single point of contact for law enforcement to have any questions regarding Bitcoin and blockchain technology answered. As such, the organization will essentially function as a closed forum, where all participants can share information. While its exact form will continue to develop in consultation with these participants, this could take place through mailing lists, conference calls, meetings and more.\n\nSpeaking to \nBitcoin Magazine,\n Coin Center Executive Director Jerry Brito explained why he believes the Blockchain Alliance is needed:\n\nBitcoin is often associated with illicit activity. And that's a shame, because Bitcoin is ultimately a neutral, open technology, a lot like email. Email is something that criminals use every day, and that absolutely regular people use every day. But we don't associate email with criminal activity, even though criminals use it every day. We need to get to that same place with Bitcoin. And part of the way to do that is to be completely open with law enforcement, be available to answer questions, and explain to them how the technology works.\n\nSimilarly, Perianne Boring, founder and president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, sees Bitcoin's reputation in Washington as major hurdle to pro-growth regulation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that Bitcoin has perception issues, which is a roadblock to mainstream adoption,\u201d Boring said in a statement. \u201cHaving an open dialogue with law enforcement and policymakers will help reduce anxiety about this transformative technology. This initiative goes hand-in-hand with the Chamber\u2019s mission of promoting a regulatory approach that supports innovation, jobs and investment. Getting criminals off the blockchain is not only good for public safety -- it\u2019s good for business.\u201d\n\nSo far, an extensive list of Bitcoin companies, individuals and institutions have joined the Blockchain Alliance. Apart from the Chamber of Digital Commerce and Coin Center, this includes Bitcoin XT and former Bitcoin Core lead developer Gavin Andresen; Bitcoin Core developer Jeff Garzik; MIT Media Lab\u2019s Digital Currency Initiative head Brian Forde; bitcoin exchanges BitFinex, Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit, Kraken and CoinX; payment processors BitPay and Bitnet; wallet services Blockchain(.info), Circle and Xapo; API-provider BitGo; mining specialist BitFury and liquidity provider Noble Markets.\n\nJason Weinstein will serve as director of the Blockchain Alliance. Weinstein has a track record in the regulatory and digital payments space, as a former deputy assistant attorney general in charge of cybercrime investigations at the Department of Justice. Weinstein is also partner at Steptoe & Johnson LLP. In addition to that, Weinstein is a member of the strategic advisory boards of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, Coin Center and BitFury.\n\n\u201cThe companies participating in this initiative are not only good companies, but they are also good corporate citizens,\u201d Weinstein said. \u201cFor the blockchain to thrive, the industry must work together to correct the misperception of bitcoin as the 'currency of criminals.' By helping law enforcement agencies address public safety concerns about bitcoin and other digital currencies, we can foster an environment in which the full potential of the blockchain can be realized.\u201d\n", "year": 2015, "month": 10, "day": 22}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nIn what can only be regarded as good news for Bitcoin, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) Thursday\n \nruled\n\n that exchanging bitcoin should not be subject to VAT (Value Added Tax). The verdict, which is the\n \nclimax\n\n of an Swedish court dispute that started back in 2012, applies to all 28 E.U. member states. VAT-law is complicated, however, and some reports on the verdict have been confusing so far.\n\nHopefully, the answers to the six questions below will help make sense of this ruling.\n\nDoes the ECJ decision mean that exchanging bitcoin falls outside of the scope of VAT?\n\nActually, no. Any dealing that consists of exchanging traditional (\u201cfiat\u201d) currencies for bitcoin (or the other way round), is regarded as a service that is \nwithin\n the scope of VAT. More specifically, this refers to the exchangers' margin; the price difference between buying and selling from which an exchanger makes its profits.\n\nThen why is everyone saying that exchanging bitcoin is free from VAT?\n\nBecause the ECJ has ruled that exchanging bitcoin is \nexempt\n from VAT. So while the European Court \ndid\n decide that exchanging bitcoin falls within the category of services that is within the framework of VAT, it also ruled that, within this category, exchanging bitcoin deserves an exemption.\n\nThe end result is mostly the same, however: no VAT is due on exchanging bitcoin.\n\nSo does this VAT exemption apply to bitcoin itself as well then?\n\nWell, no. But that\u2019s good, too.\n\nAs opposed to exchanging bitcoin, the ECJ ruled that bitcoin itself \ndoes\n completely fall outside of the scope of VAT if it is used as a means of payment.\n\nAccording to the ECJ, bitcoin has no other purpose than to be a means of payment... if it is used as such. Therefore, as long as bitcoin is used as money, it is set on equal footing with other types of money. As such, like other types of money, bitcoin doesn't need an exemption; it's not subject to VAT in the first place.\n\nSo, the end result is the same, again. No VAT is due on spending, paying and receiving of bitcoin.\n\nWhy did the ECJ decide to make exchanging bitcoin exempt from VAT?\n\nSimple: Regular money exchange services are exempt from VAT. And since the ECJ considers bitcoin to be on equal footing as other means of payment, the ECJ believes this exemption should apply to bitcoin exchanges as well.\n\nWhat does this mean for bitcoin in the EU?\n\nFor one, bitcoin exchanges, startups and users finally know where they stand from a VAT perspective.\n\nExchanges know they do not need to pay VAT over their services. Startups have a better sense of the legal domain they are in. And, perhaps most importantly, casual users don't need to worry about all sorts of complicated tax laws. Buying, selling, sending, receiving, accepting and spending bitcoin will not be taxed, which allows people to deal with bitcoin as they would with other types of money.\n\nThe only group that might not yet have all its questions answered are miners. While their selling of bitcoin will (probably) be VAT exempt, it's not completely cartain whether their production of bitcoin will.\n\nWhat happens to all the VAT that has been paid by bitcoin exchangers over the past years?\n\nIn theory, that VAT should be reimbursed.\n\nIn practice, however, this will be complicated. In order to reimburse the VAT, the money must be returned to the original buyer of the bitcoin \u2013 not the seller. As such, exchangers will need to show their national tax authorities that the reimbursed VAT will be forwarded to their customers somehow. This is no easy feat, of course.\n\nOn top of that, most European tax authorities did not charge VAT up until now in the first place. Rather, they waited for the ECJ to present its judgment.\n\n\nThanks to fiscalist for law firm Baker & McKenzie and VAT-expert\n \nRoger van de Berg\n.", "year": 2015, "month": 10, "day": 22}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nRebit.ph\n\n co-founder Luis Buenaventure \nrecently\n\n published a\n \nblog post\n\n on Medium claiming that Bitcoin does little to help cheapen remittances. \n\nWhile the math-based currency does lower the bar of entry for startups, and local technological innovation could further improve the competitive advantage of so-called \u201crebittance\u201d companies, Buenaventure argued that most of the cost is currently made in \u201cthe first and last mile.\u201d \n\nWhile Bitcoin does a great job realizing cross-boarder transfers of money, the distribution of physical cash was the expensive part of remittances all along \u2013 a problem Bitcoin hasn't solved.\n\nTo find out if Buenaventure is right, \nBitcoin Magazine\n took the pulse of four other rebittance startups:\n \nBitex\n,\nHelloBit\n,\n \nSatoshiTango\n\n and\n \nVolabit\n.\n\nThe first and the last mile\n\nMost rebittance startups agree with the main premise as presented by Buenaventure. Bitcoin does not make rebittance cheaper \u2013 at least not yet. All four companies acknowledged that the bulk of the cost is made in the first and the last mile, the part of the remittance process that doesn't really involve bitcoin. As such, rebittance startups are not particularly well positioned to compete with existing giants Western Union and MoneyGram as far as costs go.\n\nHelloBit co-founder and CEO Ali Goss explained:\n\n\u201cThese companies have very large foreign exchange (FX) departments, and they're basically able to bring the cost of sending money across boarders down to zero. We're talking about big movements of money, which they do when prices are favorable. They might even make money doing that, as opposed to it being a major cost.\u201d\n\nAs such, Goss continued, bitcoin doesn't actually remove that much friction. Rather, it can make it worse.\n\n\u201cWith bitcoin, you're adding a third currency,\u201d Goss said. \u201cYou go from U.S. dollar to bitcoin, and then from bitcoin to whatever the local currency is. You're adding an extra FX move right there alone. That increases friction. On top of that, small startups don't have a big FX department, and they don't have the big abilities that come with such a department ... they're generating more costs for themselves, not less.\u201d\n\nHannah Kim, COO and Head of Product at Volabit, added:\n\n\u201cIn addition to costs, perhaps a bigger problem is that Bitcoin companies in many countries \u2013 most notably the U.S. \u2013 cannot develop sustainable partnerships with cash-collecting and distributing networks due to unclear regulatory implications.\u201d\n\nSatoshiTango co-founder and CEO Matias Bari agreed, but emphasized that he is quite hopeful for the future, saying:\n\n\u201cI agree that rebittance is currently not cheaper than existing alternatives, but I do think that costs will lower as long as companies in the space grow and are able to charge less for the same service. That is a path we need to walk. But it is going to happen in a couple of years when the industry gets bigger and healthier and some mechanisms used today probably change for better ones, allowing us to improve our processes and lower fees.\u201d\n\nThe only company that disagreed with Buenaventure's assessment was Bitex, the Latin Americawide bitcoin exchange that offers remittance services within the region as well.\n\nBitex co-founder and Chief Marketing Officer Manuel Beaudroit stated:\n\n\u201cIn this region there's a significant reduction in cost when using bitcoin, from 15, 20, or 30 percent to 6 or 10 percent in most cases. Though it is true, though, that the main added costs are in the first and last mile, where the branch offices usually charge 2.5 percent to 3 percent.\u201d\n\nInnovation\n\nThe rebittance companies generally agreed with Buenaventure's conclusion that Bitcoin does help smaller startups get a foot on the ground in the remittance industry, while they also acknowledged that adoption of local virtual currencies or other fintech solutions could severely cut costs.\n\nBut the rebittance companies pointed out that one other aspect is even more important: innovation. The open nature of Bitcoin allows for startups to use this technology in new and innovative ways, and this is where they believe the rebittance industry should really get its edge.\n\n\u201cI would not say that the remittance industry is stagnating,\u201d Volabit's Kim explained. \u201cRather, the industry is being forced to evolve quickly by learning what works and what doesn't. The remittance population is as diverse as its use case, and looking at success cases like\n \nTransferwise\n\n it\u2019s clear to see that there are opportunities to reach people that are more open to online, tech-forward solutions.\u201d\n\nThis was seconded by Goss, who's HelloBit transformed its remittance company into a sort of \n\u201cUber for cash\n,\u201d\n where users act as \u201chuman ATMs.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmart people need to come up with smarter things, and we will ultimately see the innovation occur that will make using Bitcoin for remittance cheaper.\u201d Goss said.\n\n\u201cBut that wasn't \nour\n goal. We knew early on that it wasn't going to be cheaper right off the bat, therefore what we asked ourselves: What could we do that's different? So, with HelloBit, you might pay more sometimes, but then you\u2019d pay more for an additional service. You get the money delivered to you. Though it may be more expensive than picking it up at Western Union, or maybe the same price, you have the added benefit of delivery, which is a completely new distribution model. And out users are able to settle right there with their phone, rather than having to need a bank account.\u201d\n\nBitex's Beaudroit agreed that rebittance companies should focus on alternative markets rather than the markets that are already served by the existing rebittance industry.\n\n\u201cI see bitcoin playing a fundamental role for remittance company when needing to move funds crossborderly, more focused on B2B (business to business) than B2C (business to customer), at least for the following couple of years,\u201d Beaudroit told \nBitcoin Magazine.\n\nSatoshiTango's Bari acknowledged that rebittance companies will need some time to find the best way to utilize Bitcoin, too. He believes this will be a long process, with many failures on the way, but that this is healthy for the market as a whole.\n\n\u201cIt is normal that we see a stagnation after some two years of absolutely excitement,\u201d Bari said. \u201cIt is common; it\u2019s a Darwinian process of selection among companies.\u201d\n\nAnd, drawing a comparison to the automobile industry, Bari said:\n\n\u201cYou know Ford and Chrysler. Find out how many car companies were funded 70, 80 years ago, at the same time those two were funded. Hundreds. They couldn\u2019t make it. It took many years until they became these amazingly huge companies. But when they first started they were startups, not knowing where to aim.\u201d\n", "year": 2015, "month": 10, "day": 22}

Lee explained that miners looking to hedge against price decline, those looking for arbitrage opportunities, and \u201cpeople who are professional and directional traders would all find the tool useful.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re the first exchange to launch a radically new trading platform,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to reinvent the game and not wait to be marginalized. We\u2019re going to disrupt ourselves with this. This is big. This kind of trading will be adopted by other companies, I guarantee you.\u201d\nMargin trading is effectively borrowing bitcoin to make trades with it, returning it once an individual\u2019s trade is completed. If a user had 1 BTC and the price appreciated by $10 before selling, their profit would be $10. However, if someone borrowed bitcoin at 20x margin, they\u2019d have 20 bitcoin to trade with. If the price went up by $10, they\u2019d have effectively made $200 profit. Users effectively get more buying power than they physically have to trade with.\u00a0\nThere are two parts to the fee structure that BTCC charges. \u201cThere\u2019s a commission once you open a position to go long or go short,\u201d Lee explained. \u201cThere\u2019s also the overnight carry fee because of 20x leverage. It\u2019s sort of like an interest rate. It\u2019s very competitive.\u201d More details on pricing can be found on the exchange website.\n\u201cIt\u2019s also the first platform that allows users to earn interest,\u201d Lee explained. In essence, if a user allows their bitcoin to be lent out to other traders, they will earn interest on the bitcoin based on the fees that BTCC charges.\u00a0\nThe company recently underwent a branding change from BTC China to the now current BTCC. While the Pro Exchange is one of the first products it has launched under this new moniker, the company has many plans coming.\n\u201cOur mission is to launch more and more of these convenient and trustworthy digital currency products,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s merchant payments, remittance, and our wallet later this year. There\u2019s a bunch of things coming over the horizon.\u201d\nPro Exchange is just step one to the company\u2019s goals of building the \u201cworld\u2019s greatest company to serve this global bitcoin audience,\u201d Lee said.\nJacob Donnelly is a full-time product manager and freelance journalist covering stocks, business and bitcoin.

First, as the currency/store of value theme re-emerged, the price would start to increase, which would result in the flywheel effect. As a wheel turns, it can easily gain more momentum, resulting in further turning. The fear of missing out propagates an ever-increasing price, which partially contributed to the previous bubble.\u00a0\nTyler Durden, the pseudonymous Zero Hedge author, has offered a belief that the fear of capital controls in China could push bitcoin into a bubble like never seen before.\u00a0\n\u201cIf a few hundred million Chinese decide that the time has come to use bitcoin as the capital controls bypassing currency of choice, and decide to invest even a tiny fraction of the $22 trillion in Chinese deposits \u2026 in bitcoin (whose total market cap at last check was just over $3 billion), sit back and watch as we witness of the second coming of bitcoin, one which could make the previous all-time highs in the digital currency, seems [sic] like a low print.\u201d\u00a0\nDespite many in the \u201crebittance\u201d business believing bitcoin doesn\u2019t make remittance cheaper, Silbert predicted that 2016 would give rise to competitive cross border payments/remittance businesses that use bitcoin. However, while remittance might not be ready for disruption, international B2B transactions might be a use case that bitcoin is ripe to change.\u00a0\nDiving deeper into the finance of bitcoin, Silbert said that bitcoin was a noncorrelated asset. According to InvestorWords.com, noncorrelated assets are, \u201cassets that tend to change in value independent of the core financial markets such as stocks and bonds.\u201d\u00a0\nFundamentally, Silbert remains significantly bullish on the potential for bitcoin as an investment. With the recent rise in price, there is a growing optimism that the price of bitcoin might finally begin an ascent back to previous-bubble levels. For now, bitcoin entrepreneurs and investors continue to focus on building more products and services that will better utilize the blockchain ledger over time. As Silbert predicts, 2016 should bring many nonfinancial use cases.\u00a0\nJacob Donnelly is a full-time product manager and freelance journalist covering stocks, business and bitcoin.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin payment processor\n \nBitnet\n\n has indicated it is willing to implement block-increase proposals other than\n \nBIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) 101\n.\n This makes Bitnet the third signatory of the\n \nindustry letter\n\n supporting BIP 101 that indicates that it is open to alternative proposals.\n\nBitnet co-founder and CTO Stephen McNamara told \nBitcoin Magazine \nthat he is still convinced that the block-size limit must be increased sooner rather than later. While the industry letter sent out in August of this year expressed support for BIP 101, which increases the block-size limit to 8 megabytes and doubles every other year for 20 years, it now seems that there is room for discussion.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost our interest was, and still is, in support of an increase of the block size,\u201d McNamara said. \u201cThe community conversations, when they started this spring, were not about different proposals; they were binary \u2013 yes/no \u2013 about whether a block-size increase was a good thing or not. We are happy to see the discussion shifted from 'if' to 'how.' This is not about a BIP 101 religion, but rather a technical discussion and collaborative constructive review process which can lead to an agreement.\u201d\n\nWhat did not change for McNamara is the sense of urgency as expressed in the letter. While Bitnet does hope that a block-size consensus can be reached within the Bitcoin community, the company believes time is starting to run out.\n\n\u201cWe can certainly debate how long it may take to fully congest the network, but the fact is we can already see signs of it through unconfirmed transaction spikes, spam and stress tests,\u201d McNamara explained. \u201cThis can cause confirmation delays impacting our merchants and higher fees impacting consumers. The issue is urgent.\n\n\u201cWe have tested BIP 101 internally and are ready for BIP 101 today,\u201d he added. \u201cWe do believe in Bitcoin Core and welcome the increased efforts to discuss the issue of block size in the past couple of months. We still hope the block increase can be fully vetted by the core committers and the community.\u201d\n\nDiscussing some of the proposed alternatives, McNamara indicated that Bitnet has no specific preference for alternative block-size proposals.\n \nBIP 100\n,\n which lets miners vote on the block-size limit, as well as the \u201cquick fix\u201d\n \n2-4-8 solution\n\n that would increase the limit to 8MB over four years\u2019 time, are both acceptable alternatives for Bitnet.\n\n\u201cMost miners do now support BIP 100 through mining votes. We are open to BIP 100,\u201d McNamara explained, \u201cand we have no objection to 2-4-8 either. We\u2019re really just trying for a practical solution.\u201d\n\nLastly, McNamara acknowledged he is aware of the risks of oversized blocks, as emphasized by the \n\u201cdecentralist\n\u201d\n side of the block-size debate.\n\n\u201cWe are fully aware of these concerns. To be clear, we do not support a hundred-fold increase of the block size or anything like that \u2013 and we never have,\u201d McNamara said. \u201cAny Bitcoin use case that needs this type of volume should consider sidechains or other approaches, at least for the short and medium term. The Bitcoin network needs to grow to be useful, but that growth needs to be well-thought-out.\u201d\n\n\nEarlier this week, Bitcoin's biggest payment processor, BitPay,\n \nindicated\n\n that it is willing to implement alternative block-increase proposals, too, while mining specialist KnCMiner\n \nshifted\n\n its public support from BIP 101 to BIP 100 last summer. With Bitnet, this means that three of the signatories of the industry letter in support of BIP 101 have now publicly indicated they are prepared to accept alternative solutions.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 10, "day": 26}

In November 2013, the company raised $6 million in Series A funding from Guggenheim Partners.\u00a0\n\nBitcoin Magazine\nreached out to Eric Berger, director of growth strategy at CardCash, to find out more about the company\u2019s bitcoin-related strategy.\n\nCould you explain in a few words the main benefit that CardCash brings to consumers?\u00a0\n\nCardCash has been the industry leader in security, speed and innovation for nearly a decade. The benefits our consumers enjoy are as follows:\n\n\nCardCash offers gift card liquidity by allowing consumers to exchange their unwanted gift cards quickly and securely for cash.\n\nCardCash offers consumers the opportunity to purchase second-hand gift cards to their favorite retailers at significant discounts. These savings can amount to hundreds or thousands of dollars each year for our regular customers.\n\nLastly, CardCash fully guarantees each purchase for 45 days. That means that customers have over six worry-free weeks to use their cards.\n\n\nFurthermore, with CardCash\u2019s acceptance of bitcoin, we have now bridged the gap between bitcoin users and over 1,000 retailers that do not yet accept the innovative digital currency.\u00a0\n\nHow do consumers use your mobile app? How is the rollout plan proceeding?\u00a0\n\nOur mobile app is set to launch at the end of October. Customers will be able to purchase gift cards using their same account information, just as they would online, with our omni-channel account access. The app also has full wallet functionality, allowing customers to store their gift cards and even purchase goods at retailers\u2019 physical stores straight through the app. The next iteration of the app will also include Apple Pay and Android Pay along with improved location-based technology that will allow us to custom-tailor promotions to suit each customer better.\n\nDo you have plans to expand beyond the U.S. to international markets, and, if so, what's your expected timeline for that?\u00a0\n\nWe believe that the current domestic opportunity is still in its infancy. With this enormous potential, our primary focus for the foreseeable future is on the U.S. market. We do look forward for the opportunity to share our valuable service with new markets and consumers when the time is right.\n\nYou mention strict AML/KYC compliance policies. Isn't that likely to become a barrier to CardCash adoption from bitcoin users?\n\nCardCash has always been the industry leader concerning customer security and AML/KYC compliance, and we will continue to meet these standards for our new bitcoin users. We have seen no barriers to CardCash's bitcoin adoption and are excited for the tremendous potential impact in the bitcoin community. Policies such as purchase limits, fraud detection and account monitoring will be no different for our bitcoin users. These not only satisfy compliance requirements, they also help detect and deter fraudulent activity that ends up costing everyone more.\n\nHow do the bitcoin-only discounts work, and are you already able to offer bitcoin-only discounts?\u00a0\n\nBitcoin discounts will be an automatically credited discount at checkout, passing back our savings on transactions fees back to the consumer. We will also have bitcoin-only coupons from time to time to market, specifically, to the bitcoin community. We plan on implementing these discounts in the very near future.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 10, "day": 27}

With China driving such an increase in the bitcoin price, many have been speculating that it could be driven by capital controls.\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn China, the law stipulates that individuals cannot send more than the equivalent of $50,000 out of the country in a year. To get around this, individuals have hired smugglers to get cash out of the country, bought extremely expensive real estate in cities like New York and London, and even set up businesses in other countries with the goal of overpaying for inventory from China. All of this just to get money out of the country.\u00a0\n\nAccording to pseudonymous blogger Tyler Durden of Zero Hedge\n, the primary driver has been the Chinese purchasing bitcoin as a way of getting around capital controls.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIf a few hundred million Chinese decide that the time has come to use bitcoin as the capital controls bypassing currency of choice \u2026 sit back and watch as we witness the second coming of the bitcoin bubble,\u201d he wrote in a recent blog post\n.\n\nBut is this, in fact, what is occurring?\n\nAccording to Bobby Lee, the Founder and CEO of BTCC, while a hedge against capital controls is certainly a use case for bitcoin, it\u2019s not what is driving this run up.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI can tell you, being on the ground with the bitcoin exchange in China, I can guestimate that the vast majority of trading volume is not for that reason. The reality is, there are many loopholes around the capital controls. For the most part, it\u2019s not a strict, strict capital controls,\u201d he explained in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. \n\u201cIf you look at countries like Myanmar and Argentina, which have very strict capital controls, you\u2019ll have the price of bitcoin to USD [U.S. dollars] is much greater.\u201d\n\nJack Liu, head of international at OKCoin, also disagreed with the notion that it had anything to do with capital controls. In an email to Bitcoin Magazine\n, he said, \u201cI don't think so. It's speculation.\u201d\n\nLeon Li, CEO of Huobi, said in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, \n\u201cto be clear, it\u2019s not about capital controls.\u201d\n\nBTCC, OKCoin, and Huobi are the three biggest exchanges in China. All three don\u2019t see a fear of capital controls driving the recent run-up of the price of bitcoin.\u00a0\n\nIf it\u2019s not capital controls, what is it?\n\nIt\u2019s About Perception\n\n\u201cOver the last two months, we\u2019ve seen a steady increase in bitcoin activity and bitcoin volumes and price appreciation. The reason this price has happened is because of renewed interest,\u201d Lee explained. \u201cAll the bad news has come out over the past year and a half, and now it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nLee walked through a list of the bad news that held bitcoin back: Mt. Gox imploding, the Chinese government offering ambiguous opinions on bitcoin, and the Silk Road bitcoin being sold en masse. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in a bear market for the past 18 months,\u201d he said.\u00a0\n\nAnd with that bear market came the need for miners to liquidate more of their bitcoin than normal because they didn\u2019t know what the future price would be, Lee explained. \u201cThere\u2019s a constant selling pressured caused by bitcoin miners.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe price is recovering on a rebound after several months in a narrow range. Some Chinese traders are expressing a view on the CNY exchange rate after the last devaluation, and you have interest by mainland speculators to move to other assets after the stock market fallout,\u201d Liu of OKCoin said to Bitcoin Magazine.\n\u00a0\n\nWhat Lee does believe is that there is only one reason that the price of bitcoin is going up:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mostly new users,\u201d he said, referring to who was signing up for the site during this recent run-up in price. \u201cBitcoin price, if I may be bold, has been going up in the recent years for only one reason: more usage, more acceptance and more awareness. When bitcoin is in more hands, the price naturally goes up. It\u2019s the law of scarcity.\u201d\n\nLi of Huobi believes that there are a multitude of reasons driving the price higher. He touched on the recent regulatory environment with the CFTC saying bitcoin was a commodity and, in Europe, the courts saying that it was exempt from VAT.\u00a0\n\n\u201cMore financial institutions entered this industry,\u201d he said, \u201csuch as bitcoin-based ETN and ETF were founded in Europe. Organizations and individuals involved more in bitcoin market as the policy and funding is becoming in favor of bitcoin.\u201d\n\nBut Li also offered some negative reasons in China that might support the recent rise.\u00a0\n\n\u201cFinance industry is developing rapidly in China during recent years, however, there still exists a distance in terms of trading mechanisms compared to the developed countries, which hindered the small and medium-sized investors from enjoying convenient services and trades,\" he said. \"Chinese banking industry is still charging high transaction fees despite the fact that we\u2019re living in the Internet Age.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, bitcoin is rising, and China is leading the pack. Whether this run will last for only a short while or this is the beginning of another bull run, no one is certain.

The firm intends on using 3M\u2019s fluid to cool more than 40 megawatts of processing power.\u00a0\n\u201cThe maintenance cost of traditional low-cost air cooling systems is quite high compared to immersion cooling, and it is very problematic to use low-cost air cooling systems in the areas with hot weather, it becomes very costly,\u201d said Valery Vavilov, CEO of BitFury, in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0\n\nVavilov explained that the utilization of immersion cooling allows for a reduction in maintenance costs. Further, it opens up the possibility of the company launching mining operations in parts of the world that would otherwise not provide efficient cooling.\u00a0\n\u201cIn addition, we are able to deploy it in the areas with hot weather climate which opens possibility to operate literally in any location in the world. Also, for chips, this fluid is ideal exploitation environment and it allows to run them with maximum possible efficiency that just cannot be achieved using low-cost air-cooled systems,\u201d he explained.\u00a0\n2PIC works by placing hardware in a specially designed tank with a liquid coolant such as the Novec 7100. What makes this fluid particularly useful is that it has a low boiling point, which means that as it heats, it starts to evaporate much more quickly. That pulls the heat away from the hardware in the device, allowing them to operate at a higher rate for much longer. When the vapor hits a water-cooled condenser coil, it becomes a fluid again and falls back into the tank, thus reducing the amount of fluid loss significantly.\u00a0\n\u201cOne of the primary limitations for computer performance is the thermal environment.\u00a0 Two-phase immersion cooling with Novec fluids provides tight coupling between device temperatures and the fluid boiling temperature.\u00a0 This means that these devices operate in a narrower temperature band,\u201d explained Michael Garceau, 3M Business Development Manager, Data Center Markets, in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThis is true not just for the processors, but for the circuits and devices delivering power to them.\u00a0 This, in turn, allows the hardware to be driven harder on average than would be possible in air and \u201coverclocked\u201d as is often done in the most profitable early stages of a mining deployment.\u201d\nGarceau also explained that because these 2PIC-specific boards don\u2019t require heat sinks and cold plates, the processing hardware can be more densely packed with the 2PIC boards. This enables improved overclocking capacity.\u00a0\n\u201c500-watt ASICs have been successfully overclocked to well over 750 watts. 2PIC with a Novec fluid will enable BitFury to lower operational costs by allowing them to run ASICs more efficiently,\u201d Garceau explained.\u00a0\nThe Environment is Key for BitFury\n\nAccording to Garceau, \u201cThe streamlined system can deliver as much as 95 percent cooling energy savings with minimal fluid loss.\u201d The cost of cooling hardware is an additional expense that many miners don\u2019t consider when first starting out. Big scale fans require electricity.\u00a0\n\u201cGreen transaction processing is a significant and important part of our business strategy. With our acquisition of Allied Control, we have been able not only to utilize renewable energy sources like hydropower in our datacenter located in the Republic of Georgia, but also achieve a very energy-efficient cooling despite hot daytime temperatures,\u201d explained Vavilov.\u00a0\nThe Novec Engineered Fluids are nonflammable, have zero ozone depletion potential, have a low global warming potential, are Hazardous Air Pollutant-free, and are U.S. EPA SNAP-approved. And because the majority of the fluid condenses and drops back into the tank, replenishment isn\u2019t needed for multiple hardware generations.\u00a0\nAll told, BitFury is focused on delivering blockchain transaction processing in an efficient and green environment.\u00a0\n\u201cWe strive to ensure low carbon print and high efficiency of all our operations and already rely on renewable energy \u2013 thermal and hydropower \u2013 for all our operations,\u201d Vavilov said. \u201cWe are also in the process of developing low-cost wind turbine technology that will provide another affordable and effective energy solution. We plan that by next year our data centers will be powered by the low-cost renewable energy generated by our new wind turbines. This will allow to further significantly lower our electricity cost and secure a long-term access to cheap electricity on a predictable basis.\u201d\nWith electricity being the primary outlier that separates the profitable miners from the unprofitable, taking control of the supply of that power ensures that BitFury can remain profitable while also doing its part to reduce the significant carbon footprint found in bitcoin mining.\u00a0\nJacob Donnelly is a full-time product manager and freelance journalist covering stocks, business and bitcoin.

AlphaPoint is a financial technology company that powers digital currency exchanges and provides institutions aggregate access and order routing to digital currency markets.\nRight now, there are active digital currency markets running 24/7 in at least 45 national currencies.1 That is, there are digital currency markets in one quarter of the 180 national currencies recognized as legal tender by the United Nations. 2 \nSeven years into the onrush of Nakamoto\u2019s protocol, we think it makes sense to ask: Why does this matter? Why is closing the gap on the remaining three quarters important? What opportunities reside there?\n\nWhy It Matters\nIt matters in the first case because the geographic distribution of these markets is misaligned with the distribution of bitcoin market potential. At any given point in time, it is difficult to establish a bead on the aggregate global exchange count. Small exchanges crop up with little media presence and volunteer-run indexes have difficulty staying current.\nThe pattern, nevertheless, is clear enough: Europe and North America are each serviced by more than 30 exchanges, and East Asia by roughly 20, concentrated in China. Conversely, South Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America have nothing approaching this density. Further, exchange volumes today correlate with exchange count, with the staggering majority of digital-fiat conversion hosted in the Chinese yuan, U.S. dollar, and euro. The overwhelming majority of bitcoin-fiat trades is against the yuan, virtually all of it at zero-fee exchanges, creating masses of volume whose validity is difficult to pinpoint.3 Beyond this, American dollars and euros come second and third, respectively. Other currencies in aggregate scarcely register.\nAnd yet, digital currency\u2019s greatest mainstream potential and most compelling use cases tend to reside outside of North America, Western Europe, and East Asia.\nInstead, the greatest potential beneficiaries tend to be concentrated in national markets whose fiscal, political, and infrastructural histories have rendered basic financial services out of reach for many businesses and individuals: Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Belarus, etc.\nEconomist Garrick Hileman provides a useful snapshot of this distribution in his Bitcoin Market Potential Index (2014). Of the highest-ranking markets in the index, more than half are based in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. Likewise, there are indicators that regulatory clarity is improving in these regions -- in Chile and Nigeria particularly -- at the same time beneficial frameworks continue to elaborate themselves in more established hubs -- places such as Singapore, the United Kingdom, or Luxembourg.4\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working in markets where it\u2019s impossible for companies to sell online without giving away more than 5 percent of their business to payment processors,\u201d said Gabe Abed, co-founder and CEO of Bitt, a non-bank financial institution (NBFI) and universal Bitcoin services firm based in the Caribbean. \u201cIndividuals sending money from one island to another routinely lose 12 percent on fees. Credit card acceptance is low, and yet there\u2019s a very high penetration rate for mobile Internet -- so there\u2019s this gap, which is precisely what we\u2019re aiming to fill.\u201d\nOpportunities Across Global Markets\nThis gap between solutions offered by legacy systems and those made possible by the blockchain is falling into sharper relief for consumers and enterprises alike, and the opportunity is massive.5\nTo put matters in perspective: More than 50 countries host over $1 billion in daily foreign exchange volume. 6 In sum, there is more than $5 trillion in global FX trading per day. Even 1 percent of this total is $50 billion -- more than 1,500 times the current daily total for digital currency trading. \n\u201cIn the Bitcoin community, we\u2019re used to talking about underbanked people,\u201d said Gabriel Miron, CEO of Mexico City-based meXBT. \u201cBut more and more, we\u2019re finding that underbanked businesses are key.\u201d In moving funds between Mexico and, say, China or Brazil, banks perform FX conversion at a loss through the U.S. dollar. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re not one of a bank\u2019s largest customers, this process can take weeks. Using bitcoin as the rails, we can settle in under 24 hours. Existing bank infrastructure can\u2019t get close to that.\u201d \n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing that larger firms are particularly interested in more efficient settlement,\u201d said Jesse Chenard, founder and CEO of MonetaGo, adding that smaller enterprise clients are more interested in availing arbitrage opportunities in bitcoin markets to drive down fees. \u201cOn a recent $13,000 intracompany transfer, we saved the client $600 in fees they would have otherwise had to pay to Bank of America.\u201d In so many words, the needs and corresponding solutions are diverse, a point recently echoed by Andreas Antonopoulos.7\nBuilding Momentum\nThe opportunities we see can be spaced across two fronts: (1) making digital currencies more widely available, and (2) leveraging them to streamline international transfers. Yet we see these as part of the same movement, as two sides of the same coin -- both predicated on active, stable markets across effectively all national currencies. \nMore often than not, the speed and cost benefits offered by digital currency will be most dramatic in south-south transfers (between countries in Africa, Latin America, South Asia, etc.), where bitcoin (or other digital currencies) can facilitate FX conversion without needing to move through the U.S. dollar, radically reducing both costs and settlement times.\nAs markets expand and access improves, and as regulatory frameworks fall into sharper relief, we believe more and more businesses and individuals will recognize these benefits, that south-south trade will help drive adoption forward in the months and years ahead, and that this demand will help make digital currencies more available to the populations that stand to benefit from them most. \n1 This number is per publicly available data from bitcoin charts , Bitcoin Average , bitcoinity , Coin Market Cap , and elsewhere. An asterisk: Of course there are national markets for Litecoin, Ripple, and the like, and of course there are reasons to believe DAAP coins will become a bigger part of volumes in the near future. But the fact remains that Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization dwarfs that of its competitors. Currently BTC capitalization is fifteen times that of XRP. And of course there are informal and P2P markets for digital tokens of all kinds. But here I am defining \u2018active markets\u2019 as those serviced by at least one order matching service (one exchange), because informal markets tend to be erratic, illiquid, and difficult to quantify.\n 2 Source: United Nations Treasury \n3 See, e.g. \u201c80% of bitcoin is exchanged for Chinese yuan \u201d (Mar. 10, 2015 -Quartz)\n4 Thanks to Adam Vaziri, Director at London-based DIACLE, for his input.\n\n5 Particularly given how closely exchange distribution correlates with the distribution of the network itself and of merchant adoption. Note, for instance, the overlap between nodes and merchants, visualized on BitNodes and CoinMap , respectively. We would argue the connection is not simply correlative but causal, that mining and exchanges are preconditions for broader use. 6 Source: Bank for International Settlements Triennial Survey (April 2013) 7 IDEO Futures podcast Episode 21.5 (August 2015)", "year": 2015, "month": 10, "day": 8}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nFor the past several days*, the Bitcoin network has been plagued by a so-called \u201ctransaction malleability attack.\u201d Bitcoin users have experienced a number of annoyances, causing confusion and frustration. And while the transaction malleability issue is well-known and has plagued the Bitcoin network before, to many it is still unclear what it is, why it is a problem, who is causing the attack right now, and what can be done about it.\n*According to the claimed attacker (see below), the attack is currently paused at the time of writing, but could and probably will be continued at any time.\nWhat is transaction malleability?\nIn order to understand the transaction malleability attack, it helps to first understand the basics of how Bitcoin transactions work. In simplified form, each transaction over the Bitcoin network consists of different types of data. This includes transaction inputs (refering to the addresses bitcoin come from), transaction outputs (refering to the addresses bitcoin are sent to), the amount of bitcoin sent, and more. All of this data is cryptographically signed, combined, and scrambled (\u201chashed\u201d) into a unique and smaller piece of data: a hash. This hash is essentially the transaction ID. If a miner confirms the transaction, the transaction ID is included in a block and stored in the blockchain.\nThe problem that enables transaction malleability, however, is that effectively identical signatures can result in completely different hashes. The specifics of this are deeply cryptographic, and are very hard \u2013 if not impossible \u2013 to explain in plain English. But as one extremely simplified example to get an idea of the problem, a comparison would be that the numbers \u201c145\u201d and \u201c0145\u201d are effectively the same number in many cases. But when hashed, \u201c145\u201d and \u201c0145\u201d might actually produce completely different results.\nIn the case of the ongoing transaction malleability attack, the attacker picks transactions from the Bitcoin network, and tweaks signature data. As a result, all sorts of transactions have two completely different transaction IDs circulating on the Bitcoin network. And since a specific transaction can confirm only once, just one of the transaction IDs will be included in a block, while the other will be ignored.\nAre transaction malleability attacks a problem?\nThe essence of the transaction malleability problem arises when someone uses the transaction ID \u2013 and nothing but the transaction ID \u2013 to check whether a transaction has been included in a block. This is a problem, of course, because the transaction ID may have been changed by the attacker, and his new transaction ID could have been included in the block rather than the original transaction ID. It might then seem as if the transaction itself never went through \u2013 though it effectively did.\nThis can be problematic for several reasons.\nFor one, it complicates writing wallet software. This is a problem in particular for Bitcoin companies that use their own software, which several of the bigger businesses in the space do.\nThe best-known and most infamous example of such a company would be Mt. Gox, the world's first bitcoin exchange that spectacularly failed in 2014 as it claimed to have lost most of its customers\u2019 funds. Mt. Gox  claimed  it lost this money because it fell victim to a long-lasting malleability attack, which messed up its bookkeeping. With it seeming as if transactions never confirmed, users are said to have been able to withdraw more bitcoin than they owned. Whether this is really why Mt. Gox lost so much of its customers bitcoin remains unclear, but it could \u2013 at least theoretically \u2013 be true.\nThis is an extreme example, as Mt. Gox asserts to have automatically re-sent bitcoin merely based on the transaction IDs \u2013 not a smart thing to do. But transaction malleability could complicate matters for Bitcoin companies with a more sensible payout policy, too. If they, like Mt. Gox, run software that keeps track of transaction IDs for bookkeeping, the transaction malleability attack could severely damage their records. Even if they do not automatically resend transactions, and, as such, don\u2019t lose any, it\u2019s still a nuisance.\nA less urgent but potentially bigger problem is that transaction malleability impedes on chained transactions. Chained transactions are transactions that use an unconfirmed output as its own input, or in other words: They spend bitcoin balances that have not been confirmed yet. But if they spend transactions of which the transaction IDs are changed, they \u2013 and all subsequent chained transactions \u2013 become invalid all at once.\nChained transactions come in a lot of shapes and forms. The most common might be bitcoin spent from change addresses. But chain transactions also form the basis of more fancy bitcoin use cases, such as payment channels. Indeed, the transaction malleability issue is one of the reasons advanced scaling solutions such as the Lightning Network are not quite ready to be deployed yet.\nIt bears noting, however, that transaction malleability is no existential problem for Bitcoin. Only the transactions IDs can be changed, not the transactions themselves; no one can steal funds from anyone else, and no one can reverse or block transactions. Moreover, the current transaction malleability attack doesn\u2019t really make the deeper problems with transaction malleability worse. These risks would have existed with or without the current attack.\nWhy is the Bitcoin network being attacked?\nA short answer would be that it's hard to know for sure, as it is hard to determine who is carrying out the attack \u2013 let alone why.\nBitcointalk.org user \u201camaclin,\u201d however, has   claimed  to be behind the attack. Amaclin, who is probably Russian (or at least speaks Russian), announced his involvement in the malleability attack shortly after it was first noticed on October 1.\nAmaclin says he has carried out the attack, essentially, out of boredom. Additionally, amaclin argues that Bitcoin is fundamentally broken. He specifically points out that the incentive structures of Bitcoin\u2019s development process do not align well, as users are not incentivized to reward developers for their work building and maintaining Bitcoin. By attacking the network, amaclin believes he is revealing that only a small number of developers can fix the issue, while most Bitcoin users expect them to do so for free. That is an unsustainable proposition, amaclin says.\nAmaclin claims that he is not attacking the network in order to gain financially in any way. He also denies attacking any specific business in order to defraud them or otherwise. He has, however, posted two donation addresses in his forum signature: One is labeled a vote for the attack, while the other is labeled a vote against. At the time of writing, both addresses have had one transaction sent to them, adding up to 300 bits, worth less than 10 cents in total.\nWhether amaclin is telling the truth is hard to verify. But the fact that he \ncould\n be telling the truth, the fact that a networkwide attack on the Bitcoin network \ncould\n be carried out by a bored individual with some coding skills, is probably quite telling in itself.\n\nCan the problem be solved?\nThe good news is that the transaction malleability issue could likely be solved eventually.  BIP 62  (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 62) in particular is intended to prevent malleability attacks by narrowing down the types of data that can be included in Bitcoin transactions. BIP 62 could be implemented as a soft fork, which means that it would then be up to miners to adopt the changes.\nThe bad news is that the issue is still pretty far from actually being solved. The transaction malleability problem is quite complicated, and some solutions might create other \u2013 even bigger \u2013 problems for the Bitcoin network. BIP 62 currently is still in draft stage, and not ready to be implemented in Bitcoin Core yet. Moreover, it is far from clear that BIP 62 does or even can tackle all possible malleability issues. It is possible that additional exploits have not yet been found, and have, therefore, not yet been countered by proposals included in BIP 62.\nWhile fixing the malleability issue is widely considered to be a problem that needs solving, it might take a while before a definite solution is ready \u2013 if one ever is. For the foreseeable future, wallet software will have to tackle the problem using workarounds.\n\nThanks to Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd and   Bitonic\n CEO Jouke Hofman for providing feedback.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 10, "day": 7}

In an interview with \nBitcoin Magazine\n, Nora Kirkizh, media relations manager of Yandex.Money further explained that bitcoin fits perfectly with the payment solutions offered by Yandex.Money, ranging from the online payment solution used by more than 76,000 online stores, e-wallets, online banking services, etc.\n\n\u201cWe are definitely paying close attention to cryptocurrencies,\u201d the Yandex team told \nBitcoin Magazine.\n\n\u201cThe technology on which they are based can be used as the foundation for lots of different products,\u201d said Kirkizh. \u201cFor example, Yandex.Money offers online stores Yandex Payment Solution. With this service they can accept payments from customers via bank cards, e-wallets, online banking accounts and other possible payment methods. Currently, over 76,000 online stores use Yandex Payment Solution to process their payments. Indeed, bitcoin would fit this range of methods perfectly. If it was one of the options in Yandex Payment Solution, users could easily use it to pay for goods on any website. Nevertheless, until cryptocurrencies are regulated by Russian law, we cannot work with them viably.\u201d \n\nLegality of Bitcoin\n\nDespite the company\u2019s interest in bitcoin and its advantages, the legality of bitcoin in the country is still undecided. While the Russian Central Bank prohibits the use of bitcoin, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced that bitcoin can probably be used in \u201csome account.\u201d\n\nDue to this uncertainty, the Yandex team plans to wait until the authorities and the government approve the use of bitcoin for corporations and organizations.\n\n\u201cDifferent institutions have different attitude to bitcoin. Russian Central Bank prohibited this currency in the country, for instance, although other organizations were interested in bitcoin and suggesting to know it better. We still do not know what bitcoin will be in the near future, and there is not an opportunity to work with it legally,\u201d said Kirkizh.\n\nYandex.Money currently has more than 22 million users, with more than 12,000 new accounts opened daily. Yandex believes that bitcoin\u2019s efficiency in processing payments and transactions could greatly benefit its financial platform and could be offered as an alternative to credit card and bank payments.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrencies have their pros and cons. On the one hand, it\u2019s an inexpensive technology and it\u2019s very easy to implement, and so as soon as it becomes legal to work with them, basically any payment service will be able to quickly implement the technology,\u201d continued the Yandex team.\n\nHowever, the Yandex.Money team is still worried that most of their users will not want to take the initiative to convert fiat-money to cryptocurrencies.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nLuis Buenaventure, co-founder of one of the best known bitcoin remittance companies in the space,\n \nRebit.ph\n\n, has published a\n \nblog post\n\n on Medium claiming that the cryptographic currency does little to help cheapen remittances.\nBitcoin remittances, better known as \u201crebittances\u201d (a term Buenaventure claims to have popularized), allow customers to send cash to friends or family abroad. Effectively, this means that only the rebittance service itself uses bitcoin, both the sending and receiving end of the transaction merely touch cash. Since it is cheaper to send bitcoin around the globe compared to fiat currency, companies such as Rebit.ph aim to compete with existing remittance giants like Western Union and MoneyGram.\nIn his sobering blog post, however, Buenaventure severely nuances the advantages of using bitcoin in this manner. According to the Rebit.ph co-founder, who departed the company last August, bitcoin doesn't really enable cheaper remittance from a customers' point of view. This is because nearly all of the costs made by remittance (or rebittance) companies are in \u201cthe first and last miles\u201d of the process anyway. In particular, it's converting digital money into physical cash, and distributing this cash to the different end-points to be picked up locally, that bears most of the cost. Buenaventure says it makes little difference whether the funds made it there as digital dollars or as digital bitcoin.\nIn the case of the Philippines, where Rebit.ph is most active, the end-points consist of local pawnshops that hold a firm grip over the national remittance market, Buenaventure explains:\n\nThe pawnshops are \nthe last mile\n, and no one, not even the banks, are close to touching their aggregate dominance. As such, they can charge whatever they want for their services, and the oligopolistic nature of the industry ensures that there is very little difference in price between one provider and another.\n\nThe costs of a bitcoin-powered remittance and that of a transaction powered by MoneyGram or any other traditional provider are markedly similar, because the local currency needs to flow through the same physical channels.\n\n\n\nBut using bitcoin instead of fiat currency behind the screens is not completely pointless, Buenaventure maintains. Most importantly, the flexibility of the cryptographic currency allows rebittance companies to set up shop with far fewer startup costs. Since SWIFT transfers are slow, competitors such as Western Union and MoneyGram need to hold plenty of fiat currency in reserve locally in order to keep up with demand. The speed of bitcoin transfers, on the other hand, allows rebittance companies to get hold of local fiat currency much faster.\n\nBuenaventure explains:\n\n\u201cThis 'prefunding' strategy is the main thing that young bitcoin remittance startups are now able to circumvent. Instead of advancing $100,000 to each country that you want to do business in, you settle each transaction in real-time with bitcoin. From a cost perspective, it\u2019s the difference between building a huge server farm versus pay-as-you-go hosting on Amazon AWS, and is a true game-changer.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Buenaventure wraps up his blog post on an even more positive note. If it were possible to bring the costs of the last mile down, he argues, rebittance services would start to make a lot of sense. Buenaventure believes this cost could be brought down specifically if local currency systems advance from physical cash to digital currency, as this could cut local cash distribution offices out of the loop.\n\nWhile this is nowhere near reality in the Philippines and most other developing countries, it is not that far-fetched of an idea, as some Third World regions are already progressing in that direction. The best known example is Kenya's M-Pesa, a mobile phone payments system used by almost all Kenyans to transfer mobile minutes.\n\n\u201cThe perfect solution appears to be a hybrid between the current bitcoin remittance startups and the ubiquitous mobile-money network that currently exists only in our dreams,\u201d Buenaventure concludes.\n\n\u201cIf we can use bitcoin to replace SWIFT during the international part of the journey, and employ the local mobile money network as our domestic transport, then we\u2019ve really got something. Until then, associating bitcoin so directly with cheaper remittances is perhaps missing the point: the cryptocurrency has illuminated an even larger problem that it simply cannot solve on its own.\u201d\n\n", "year": 2015, "month": 10, "day": 8}

As a result, there are now large venture capital investments and lots of startups building infrastructure.\n\u201cThe people behind the industry used to be very libertarian, very political in nature, and wanted to push an alternative currency and an alternative lifestyle,\u201d said Liu. \u201cYou are now seeing the bitcoin players receive venture capital and work with banks closely, trying to create a more harmonious financial system integrating the traditional financial system with the Bitcoin network, and that\u2019s going to be much more powerful.\u201d\nOKCoin.cn\n\nand OKCoin.com\n, two separate companies owned by the same investors and focused respectively on Chinese and worldwide digital currency trading, were founded in 2013 with a $1 million angel investment from Ventures Lab and Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper, and received a $10 million series A funding round in March 2014. OKCoin is perhaps the largest exchange in the world with 20 percent of daily trading volume, said Liu.\n\u00a0\u201cAs a native speaker of both English and Chinese, and as someone who has worked in traditional finance and at a U.S.-based bitcoin exchange, I hope to bring both international and institutional perspective to OKCoin and to shed more light on the Chinese market with the global Bitcoin community,\u201d said Liu when he joined OKCoin as Director of institutional strategy and sales\nin November 2014. \u201cI view OKCoin now as an international company, not as a Chinese one.\u201d\nAccording to Liu, the most interesting applications use bitcoin and the blockchain as a transparent intermediate step for fund transfers in fiat currencies, making sending and receiving money as easy as sending and receiving email.\n\u201cWe can hide bitcoin technology in the background, and that\u2019s what we have launched with a product called OKLink, in the spring, that was the first \u2018superwallet\u2019 in the world,\u201d said Liu. \u201cA superwallet is really a mobile wallet that allows you to hold a more comfortable type of value, like the USD or the CNY, but transact over the Bitcoin network.\u201d Liu added that OKLink transactions aren\u2019t affected by the volatility of bitcoin. \u201cBecause you are doing instant buy of bitcoin and sell of bitcoin, you are not affected by the bitcoin price,\u201d he said.\nOKCoin launched\nthe OKLink \u201csuperwallet\u201d in April. OKLink\nis an open digital wallet, which allows national and digital currencies to transact cross company, cross border, and cross currency in an instantaneous and free manner. OKCoin gives an example of consumer-to-consumer transaction in fiat currencies channeled transparently through the blockchain:\n\u201cPaul, an American, and Tom, a Canadian, are good friends. Paul is a Circle user while Tom uses OKLink. Tom would like to borrow from Paul $100 USD worth of Canadian dollars (CAD). Tom opens his OKLink Superwallet and shows his QR Code to Paul. Paul through scanning the QR code with his Circle Superwallet, sends Tom $100 USD. The Circle Superwallet buys exactly $100 USD worth of bitcoins from a U.S. dollar Bitcoin exchange and then via the Bitcoin network sends the bitcoins to Tom\u2019s OKLink account. Tom has instructed as default that incoming funds should be received as CAD. OKLink Superwallet takes the received bitcoins and sells it on a CAD Bitcoin exchange for CAD. In the end, Paul sent $100 USD to Tom, and Tom received it as CAD to use.\u201d\nBesides consumer-to-consumer transactions, OKLink can be used for business-to-business, consumer-to-business, and business-to consumer transactions.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is a huge market, especially in China,\u201d continued Liu. China already owns around 50 percent of bitcoin mining hashpower and 60 percent of exchange volume, and Chinese people \u2013 especially students \u2013 are frequently abroad and need efficient cross-border payments. Chinese consumers are already used to \u201ca beautiful payment experience\u201d with WeChat\nand Alipay\nfor domestic payments, and they expect the same for cross border payments.\nInterestingly, the Bank of America (BoA) recently filed a patent application\ntitled \u201cSystem and Method for Wire Transfers Using Cryptocurrency\u201d for an alternative to traditional wire transfers, where the funds are first transferred to a cryptocurrency exchange, then converted to a cryptocurrency such as bitcoin, then sent to another exchange, and finally converted into another currency for the recipient.\u00a0\nIn other words, BoA wants to patent the concept of using a cryptocurrency as a transparent intermediate step for fiat currency transfers, but it seems that OKCoin got there first.", "year": 2015, "month": 10, "day": 5}

Koenig, who runs the production company Bitfilm, flipped this concept last year, and decided to focus exclusively on Bitcoin. Apart from the main event in Berlin, editions were setup by local communities in Buenos Aires, Seoul, Amsterdam, Budapest and Ubud (Indonesia), establishing Bitfilm Festival as the first global Bitcoin filmfestival.\n\n\n\u201cWe re-invented our festival last year,\u201d Koenig said. \u201cIt was a great experience to focus on films about this new form of money that takes away power from banks and governments.

But smaller businesses are forced to rack up credit card bills and bank loans in order to get their dream off the ground. As of today, your local coffee roaster may use Chroma.fund to raise investment from their customers and community. This movement will reshape the entire American economy,\u201d he said.\n\nEach certificate or \u201cbond\u201d issued by the platform represents a pre-defined percentage of a company\u2019s gross revenue. Payments to investors and owners of the bonds issued by the Chroma.fund platform will be received through the company\u2019s payment utility in U.S. dollars. The investors can trade these certificates on a securities exchange that the company plans to launch as soon as they receive approval from authorities.\n\n\u201cThe underlying crypto security will also make these bonds tradable, if and when we're approved to launch a securities exchange,\u201d said Estes.\n\nRebuilding Wall Street from Scratch\n\nThe Chroma.fund platform has one main difference from other blockchain-based crypto security and asset settlement platforms such as Symbiont, T0 and Digital Asset Holdings. While these platforms work to optimize existing financial platforms and banking systems in the Wall Street, the Chroma team is trying to rebuild the Wall Street scratch, and replace traditional financial platforms and settlement systems like the Nasdaq.\n\n\u201cWe're closely watching Symbiont, T0 and Digital Asset Holdings. Each of them could be considered a competitor, if not for one key distinction: They're selling technology to Wall Street -- we're using Bitcoin to rebuild the system from scratch. You don't need a broker to invest on Chroma.fund,\u201d Estes told \nBitcoin Magazine.\n\nEstes further emphasized the importance of bitcoin and its underlying technology, the blockchain technology in the development of their platform, Chroma.fund. Over the past few months, many platforms seeking to issue crypto security on the blockchain network have emerged. However, the majority of them are still trying to create and develop their own blockchains and issue their own cryptocurrencies, instead of using an existing secure blockchain such as the bitcoin blockchain.\n\n\u201cUsing a traditional web application to store investment certificates is a really bad idea. It would be as hard to do well as storing credit cards. The blockchain makes it possible for us to rebuild Wall Street's complex system of registering ownership of investment securities at a fraction of the institutional cost.

Not only is it preparing to take a more active role on the Bitcoin world stage, but it is also planning to release a host of new products and services in the coming months, including the 14 nanometer chips and miners. \n\u201cWe are very excited about the advances we\u2019ve made,\u201d \nVirgilio Lizardo Jr,\n Head of International at Bitbank told \nBitcoin Magazine\n in an exclusive interview. \u201cThe chip promises to be the cutting edge technology that BW prides itself in producing. We will also be offering the 14nm chip in a miner for consumers. The power, efficiency and noise reduction benefits aims to introduce a new standard to the industry.\u201d \n\nMore details about this new technology will be forthcoming the weeks ahead.\n\nBW was co-founded by LK Group Limited and CHBTC on Aug. 10, 2014. BW stands for Bi Wang which in Chinese literally means \u201cCoin website.\u201d \u00a0Wenjie Zhai, one of the very first Bitcoiners in China and the CEO and founder of LK Group, is the current CEO of BW. Songxiu Hua, the founder of Bitbank, CHBTC.com, and Jua.com, acts as the CTO of BW although he is not involved in the day-to-day operations of the company; his primary role is to offer technical advice and website consultation. \n \nIn 2015, BW joined the Bitbank family of Chinese Bitcoin companies with a focus on combining bitcoin mining resources in order to find greener and more efficient ways to mine. Over the years, Bitcoin has \ndrawn criticism\n for its consumption of energy. The electricity required to run and cool mining equipment is costly, in terms of both economic and environmental resources. \n\nBW points out that mining anything \u2014 metals or bitcoin \u2014 has an environmental impact. But by harnessing the plentiful hydroelectric power that is available in remote regions of China, BW\u2019s bitcoin miners are able to put that green energy to use in a way that creates a far smaller footprint than any other form of mining. Furthermore, because of the power source\u2019s rural locations, BW is able to get the electricity \u2014 much of which would otherwise go to waste \u2014 at a very low rate.\n\n\u201cHydropower offers a long-term, low-cost and stable source of electricity with the potential to increase the amount of miners in the future,\u201d says BW. \u201cThe mining farms are located in rural developing areas. By investing there, this contributes to the local economy by creating new jobs in the area\u2026.These areas are surrounded by natural beauty and an abundance of water and we work hard to keep it this way for future generations to enjoy.\u201d\nBesides taking a leadership role in preserving the natural environment, BW also wants to protect the Bitcoin environment. As it expands, and as more Chinese miners begin to take advantage of plentiful and cheap hydroelectricity, BW is mindful of the potential for centralization of Chinese mining. \nIn China, \u201cmost of the miners are Bitcoin enthusiasts who see the potential of Bitcoin and want to do their best to help the development of Bitcoin,\u201d says BW. \u201cThis includes being aware of how much percentage of the network we are part of and being responsible stakeholders in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe company also credits the Chinese government with being a supportive partner. \u201cThe government has been encouraging of Bitcoin mining companies because Bitcoin is a technology that combines elements of hardware and software. They have observed the benefits and profits it has produced and have been supportive of this.\u201d \nRecently, Bitbank received a grant of 50,000 Yuan and office space in a new innovation and high-tech zone built in the city of Zhongshan, Guangdong province. The city plans on investing 67 million Yuan over the next 5 years on the initiative.\n\nAt a time when the Bitcoin protocol is in a state of flux, as developers debate scalability options and the future of block sizes, BW is playing the part of the cautious observer; at the same time, as the fifth-largest mining pool in the world, it has also decided to take on more of a leadership role in the Bitcoin community.\n\u201cThough Chinese miners have greatly contributed to the development of Bitcoin, we feel that there is a wall between China and the rest of the community. Perhaps even a \u2018Great Wall?\u2019\u201d says BW. \u00a0\u201cThere are many factors that contribute to this: language, culture, distance, etc. At BW we would like to work towards helping to increase communication and cooperation in the community, especially when it comes to China.\u201d \n", "year": 2015, "month": 10, "day": 12}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBlockstream has \nannounced\n\n it will launch its first commercial Bitcoin sidechain by early 2016. The sidechain, codenamed \u201cLiquid,\u201d offers instant transactions, providing a fast settlement layer for bitcoin exchanges, brokerages and other industry members.\n\nAs its main advantage, Liquid provides instant and secure transactions among all users of the sidechain. While Bitcoin transactions can typically take up to an hour to be sufficiently secured by the blockchain, Liquid offers a similar level of security within seconds.\n\nBlockstream, which received a $21 million\n \nfunding round\n\n last year and\nemploys\n several Bitcoin Core developers, intends to deploy the sidechain among different exchanges and other Bitcoin service providers. Users with accounts at several of these exchanges will then be able to move bitcoin from one account to another within an instant, instead of having to wait for the transaction to confirm on the blockchain.\n\nSpeaking to \nBitcoin Magazine,\n Blockstream CEO and co-founder Austin Hill explained the added advantages of using Liquid:\n\n\u201cLiquid is mostly targeted at exchanges, and through them at institutional traders. These traders are the market makers that continually move funds back and forth from one exchange to the other, making use of arbitrage opportunities, as such minimizing spreads and increasing liquidity. These more sophisticated traders look at bitcoin's confirmation times as a negative, and really do need the type of speed of markets that Liquid can offer.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just exchanges and their users that can benefit from Liquid, Hill continued:\n\n\u201cWe also have customers that are end users themselves. They buy and sell bitcoin on multiple exchanges for their own customers' needs. A good example of that would be wallet provider Xapo; it is a huge benefit for them to have instant access to all the other markets. Another example could be companies that use bitcoin for remittances. Right now they need to adopt sophisticated hedging strategies to counteract the volatility of bitcoin; instant transactions can obviously even that out.\u201d\n\nSidechains are basically alternative blockchains that use bitcoin as a currency unit. First conceived a\n \nyear ago\n\n, they allow for bitcoin to move in and out of different \u201cpegged\u201d blockchains. As such, users of a sidechain can transfer bitcoin using varying rule-sets \u2013 not just those imposed by the original Bitcoin blockchain (such as the 10-minute confirmation time).\n\n\nMuch like Blockstream's open-source testnet sidechain \u201cElements,\u201d Liquid uses a \u201cfederated consensus\u201d security model to confirm transactions. This holds that bitcoin sent to the sidechain are locked into a typical multisig address on the Bitcoin blockchain, requiring several private keys to unlock. The keys needed to unlock these bitcoin are effectively transferred to Liquid, where they can be used to transfer the pegged value within the sidechain. \n\nAs opposed to the Bitcoin blockchain, transactions on Liquid are not processed by miners. Instead, some of the companies using Liquid will act as as functionaries that validate transactions for each other using tamper-resistant hardware boxes with a special software stack embedded. Transactions confirm if a supermajority of these functionaries sign them. While this introduces a minimal level of trust in the system, it\u2019s exceedingly difficult for functionaries to cheat the system, as no one entity is in charge. A supermajority of functionaries would need to be compromised at the same time in order to block transactions or steal funds.\n\n\u201cThere have previously been a number of attempts by different exchanges to try and realize something like this,\u201d Hill said. \u201cCustomers were asking for it, and these companies wanted to test the benefits. But previously, all attempts to do this included some form of counterparty credit agreements, or agreements to accept transactions with no confirmations. Because of the required trust involved in these kinds of solutions, they were never actually launched. By using a federated consensus sidechain, we can give exchanges the control of their own funds, but with the added functionality of instant transactions.\u201d\n\nExchanges and other industry members that wish to join the Liquid sidechain must subscribe through Blockstream, which charges a monthly fee. So far, some of the world's biggest bitcoin exchanges and other prominent industry leaders have joined the project.

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nHard forks\n\n are a rather contentious issue in Bitcoin. The controversy surrounding hard forks can be seen most prominently in the context of \nBitcoin XT\n\n\u2019s implementation of \nBIP 101\n.\n\nWhile there have been successful Bitcoin hard forks in the past, the problem with hard forks of the Bitcoin blockchain is that they\u2019re, well, hard. Any change to the Bitcoin protocol that requires a hard fork essentially requires near-complete consensus to avoid a potential blockchain split. \n\nFor example, there are many individuals in the Bitcoin development community who do not believe that BIP 101\u2019s use of a 75 percent majority vote by miners as a mechanism for enabling a larger block size limit is such a good idea.\n\nHard forks are difficult, but they have to happen from time to time in order for Bitcoin to grow and evolve. For this reason, some have proposed the idea of scheduled hard forks. This would essentially create a regular update schedule for the blockchain for changes that require a hard fork during the implementation process.\n\nProblems with Regularly Scheduled Hard Forks\n\nBitcoin Foundation\n\n Chief Scientist \nGavin Andresen\n\n and \nBitcoin Core\n\n Contributor \nPeter Todd\n\n were both recently asked for their opinions on scheduled hard forks during the \nBitcoin governance panel at Bitcoin Pacifica 2015\n,\n and neither of them seemed overly bullish on the concept. For one, Todd noted that the schedule may become useless because it is not set in stone.\n\n\u201cI would point out that -- I would start by at least doing one,\u201d he said. \u201cTrying to go figure out what does a schedule actually look like. You can delay the schedule; it becomes very tricky.\u201d\n\nTodd, who always seems to be able to pick out the flaws in any proposal, also noted that miners could ultimately decide to veto any hard fork they don\u2019t like.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s look at this from an adversarial point of view,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we have a hard fork and some miners decide that the next hard fork they disagree with -- the reality is they can go veto a hard fork.\u201d\n\nMeasuring Consensus is Hard\n\nA third issue pointed out by Todd had to do with figuring out what would be implemented in each individual hard fork. In his view, there does not exist a good mechanism for coming to consensus, nor measuring it:\n\n\u201cWell, again, we don\u2019t have good methods for this other than to accept that hard forks are hard, and getting consensus is something that kind of needs to happen. Maybe we do need some technological measures, such as miner voting, maybe \nproof-of-stake\n\n voting, but beyond that, it\u2019s really hard to imagine how you actually create durable social institutions when they\u2019re so easily undermined at protocol, almost by design.\u201d\n\nHard Forks Have to Be Hard\n\nGavin Andresen also shared his cynical view of regularly scheduled hard forks, mainly pointing out that there could be issues because \u201cpeople are lazy and they don\u2019t like upgrading.\u201d According to Andresen, this could cause issues related to having proper validation between users on the network. The key point that Andresen made during his comments had to do with making sure that hard forks were hard to pull off:\n\n\u201cI think hard forks have to be hard. I actually do agree with \nJeff Garzik\n.\n There has to be community consensus, and the community has to be aware of what\u2019s going on with them. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019d have to think a little bit more of: Would it make sense to have a regular schedule, where if there was nothing in the hard fork, maybe the hard fork just doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n", "year": 2015, "month": 10, "day": 13}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nEarlier this year, Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja released the Lightning Network white paper. In it they theorize how a layer on top of the Bitcoin blockchain can allow for instant and cheap bitcoin transactions, while vastly improving its scalability.\n\nAs a result of the block-size limit debate, the Lightning Network has been getting a lot of attention lately. But, unfortunately, wild myths have started to dominate the discourse. Suddenly thrown in the middle of a long-lasting conflict of visions, Poon and Dryja's concept is hailed both as the great savior solving all of Bitcoin's problems \u2013 and as a source of deep corruption within Bitcoin's development community.\n\nThis article will not seek to explain how the Lightning Network is set to function on a technical level. Such explanations can be found\n\nhere\n\nand\n\nhere\n\n, and for those who really want to immerse themselves with all of the nitty-gritty details of how it all works,\n\nhere\n.\n\nRather, this article addresses 11 common myths surrounding the Lightning Network, in hopes of putting these to bed for good.\n\nMyth #1: Core developers are crippling Bitcoin to force users onto the Lightning Network.\n\nAlthough Poon and Dryja, along with several others, are currently realizing their own Lightning Network-based startup, Blockstream has been the only company funding the development of the Lightning Network so far. Specifically, the Bitcoin business with a\n$21 million seed round\n\nunder its belt empoyed Paul \u201cRusty\u201d Russel to work on an implementation of the concept.\n\nMeanwhile, some of Bitcoin\u2019s most prominent developers -- such as Gregory Maxwell and Pieter Wuille -- are on Blockstream\u2019s payroll, too. This has led some to believe that Blockstream is working nefariously. It\u2019s been alleged that the company is blocking any increase of Bitcoin\u2019s block-size limit, as this will drive up transaction fees, forcing bitcoiners to use the Lightning Network instead.\n\nThis logic, however, seems very farfetched at best.\n\nFirst, it's not just Blockstream employees who prefer to keep blocks small. The \u201c\ndecentralist\n\n\u201d side of the debate includes a diverse group of programmers and other bitcoiners, including Bitcoin Core lead developer\nWladimir van der Laan\n,\nBitcoin Core developer\nPeter Todd\n,\ndigital currency veteran\nNick Szabo\n,\nformer Bitcoin Foundation director\nJon Matonis\n,\nbitcointalk.org and r/bitcoin admin \u201c\ntheymos\n,\u201d\nand plenty of others.\n\nSecond, some of the most prominent Blockstream employees and Core developers opposing a block-size increase \u2013 most notably\nMaxwell\n\nand\nWuille\n\n\u2013 were skeptical of raising this limit long before Blockstream was even founded, and long before the Lightning Network white paper was published. Both were, in fact, some of the first block-size conservatives, back when the controversy first arose early in 2013.\n\nThird, even if transaction fees on the Bitcoin network do rise, that doesn't really \u201cforce\u201d people onto the Lightning Network at all. It will always be possible to use the Bitcoin blockchain directly if one so wishes \u2013 it will just cost more. If anything, users might be\nincentivized\nto use the Lightning Network, which is categorically different from being\nforced\nto do so. And even that is debatable, as there are plenty of alternative solutions with which to transfer money.\n\nBut fourth, and most importantly, the case for smaller blocks is simply much more reasonable than the \u201cforce-bitcoiners-to-use-Lightning\u201d argument would have you believe. The question of how to scale Bitcoin has been an issue since the early days, and almost all developers agree that oversized blocks pose a security risk. While it is debatable what block size is too big (and the decentralists might be off the mark on this one) it is hard to deny that the Lightning Network can solve real, existing problems in regard of scalability \u2013 not to mention cost and speed.\n\nMyth #2: There is no conflict of interest for the Core developers employed by Blockstream.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, some developers employed by Blockstream and working on Bitcoin Core have claimed that their involvement in both projects are wholly separate and does not represent any sort of a conflict of interest.\n\nThis, however, is not true either, and claiming otherwise might be the result of a confusion of terminology.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n\n\u201cA conflict of interest (COI) is a situation in which a person or organization is involved in multiple interests, financial interest, or otherwise, one of which could possibly corrupt the motivation of the individual or organization.\u201d\n\n(Other sources cite similar definitions.)\n\nIn this context, the word \u201cpossibly\u201d is key. The Core developers working for Blockstream do not actually\nneed\nto be influenced by the company when they work on Bitcoin for there to be a conflict of interest. The simple fact that they potentially\ncould\nbe, is reason enough. Even if Maxwell, Wuille and others are all perfectly capable of separating their two occupations, and they work as honestly and properly as humanly possible for both Blockstream as well as Bitcoin Core, their involvement in both is still a conflict of interest.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that absent an independent and sustainable funding model for Bitcoin developers, there might\nalways\nbe conflicts of interest within the development community. Whether that poses a problem, and how big that problem is, is up for debate. But no one has presented a clear-cut and workable solution for this problem yet.\n\nMyth #3: The Lightning Network will be controlled by Blockstream\n\nIt is sometimes suggested that Blockstream will effectively control the Lightning Network, and, as such, will be able to determine how people use it, and what for.\n\nThere is some truth to this argument. If Blockstream deploys a fully functioning Lightning Network, they will technically control the code base.\n\nHowever, the Lightning Network is an open-source project. And, as opposed to Bitcoin itself, it's not even an open-source project that requires consensus among all Bitcoin users over the protocol rules. This means that anyone can fork the Lightning Network any time they want, potentially adjust the code in any way they want, and deploy their own version whenever they want. It might even be possible for users of different types of Lightning Networks to transact with each other, as long as there are nodes connecting the two.\n\nIndeed, competing implementations of the Lightning Network, such as\nAmiko Pay\n,\nare being worked on already, while Poon, Dryja and others are setting up a company to realize their own implementation. Moreover, two Lightning Network-type solutions, the\nThunder Network\n\nand\nStroem\n,\nhave been deployed already.\n\nMyth #4: The Lightning Network requires large payment hubs that will control the network.\n\nSome argue that the Lightning Network will impede some of Bitcoin's most valuable properties, such as decentralization and censorship resistance. According to this argument, the Lightning Network requires large hubs to route most of the payments through. These could then block certain transactions, such as donations to WikiLeaks or other political dissidents.\n\nThis argument is largely based on the assessment that the most efficient network configuration \u2013 the configuration that requires the least amount of hops from any node to any other node \u2013 is a hub-and-spoke model. As such, the Lightning Network might naturally evolve to resemble a hub-and-spoke model, too. Hubs in this network could very well be big Bitcoin entities that almost everyone uses in some way or another already, like exchanges, wallet services and payment processors.\n\nImportantly however, and much like Bitcoin itself, anyone on the Lightning Network can open a payment channel with anyone else at any time. Therefore, if Lightning hubs do emerge, they cannot control the network. Even if all existing hubs refuse to open a channel with WikiLeaks, anyone else still can, hence routing around these hubs. In fact, WikiLeaks could opt to become a hub itself.\n\nMyth #5: Lightning hubs will infringe on users\u2019 privacy.\n\nWhile it is simply impossible for potential hubs on the Lightning Network to control the flow of funds, a slightly more accurate criticism of the system is that these hubs might be able to keep track of payments on the network. Since most of the transactions will route through these hubs, they could observe the flow of funds, impeding on users' privacy.\n\nThis could be true. However, all transactions on the Bitcoin network are currently publicly available and traceable by anyone\nalready.\nOn the Lightning Network, on the other hand, many transactions will be seen only by the hub operators. As such, the Lightning Network by default offers more privacy than the Bitcoin network currently does, not less.\n\nMoreover, recent\nadvancements\non the Lightning protocol suggest that it should be possible to route transactions on the Lightning Network in a similar way as messages over the Tor network are. This would entail that all nodes on the Lightning Network know only from which directly connected node a transaction came \u2013 and to which directly connected node it must be sent. But they would not know which node initiated the transaction, nor at which node it will end up. If this is worked out properly, the Lightning Network could offer far more privacy than the Bitcoin network currently does.\n\nMyth #6: Blockstream will earn fees off of the Lightning Network.\n\nIt is sometimes argued that Blockstream is merely, or at least mainly, pushing the Lightning Network (and blocking an increase of the block-size limit) because it plans to earn fees by running a Lightning Network hub.\n\nIt's not unlikely that Lightning hubs will indeed charge a fee for their service as a middleman. And since anyone can set up a hub, it's possible that Blockstream might want to do so, too.\n\nBut since anyone can set up a hub and earn fees by doing so, it is unlikely that anyone will make a huge profit. In a free market, competition should keep prices competitive, minimizing profit for anyone involved.\n\nIn reality, there is very little reason to believe Blockstream aspires to be in the business of being a financial intermediary. So far, nothing indicates that they will want to, nor will they be particularly well positioned to be one.\n\nMyth #7: Blockstream won't make any money off the Lightning Network.\n\nSince Blockstream won't really be able to control the Lightning Network, nor seems likely to make a lot of money by charging fees as a Lightning hub, this begs the question why the company funds its development in the first place.\n\nTo answer that question, it should first be noted that Blockstream is by no means pouring huge amounts of capital into the Lightning Network. The company is paying one salary, that of Rusty Russell, and that's it. While we can probably assume that Rusty is doing well, the Lightning Network is by no means a multi-million dollar operation.\n\nStill, that leaves the question why Blockstream is funding Lightning Network development at all.\n\nThe most likely answer is that Blockstream is not completely sure either. As far as an explanation from the company goes, it believes that its in-house expertise will somehow be worth money eventually. In a world where millions or even billions use the Lightning Network, Blockstream assumes a profit can be made somehow, for instance through support, training and consulting services.\n\nA comparison has been made to Red Hat. Red Hat, an American multinational software company, has a similar business model for other open-source projects, most notably the Linux operating system. The company provides all sorts of Linux-related services to a host of different clients all across the world. And with an annual revenue of more than $1 billion, Red Hat has been doing quite well indeed \u2013 probably much better than any Lightning hub ever will.\n\nMyth #8: The Lightning Network requires a controversial hard fork of the Bitcoin network.\n\nAnother argument against the Lightning Network is that it's far from certain that it can be implemented. Much like a block-size limit increase, it is said that enabling the Lightning Network will require controversial changes to the Bitcoin protocol, and perhaps even a hard fork.\n\nThe Bitcoin network will indeed require several updates in order to support the Lightning Network. These are, most notably, a solution to the malleability issue (perhaps\nBIP 62\n)\nand the option to lock transactions until some future point in time\n(BIP 65\n).\nNeither of these adjustments, however, require a hard fork. Instead, they can be soft forked into the protocol, and none of these soft forks seem to be controversial on a technical level.\n\n(Of course, similar changes can be implemented through a hard fork, too, if that were to be preferred. But it would not be necessary.)\n\nMyth #9: Because of the Lightning Network, the block-size limit will not need to be raised.\n\nThe Lightning Network is set to enable a virtually unlimited amount of transactions between two connected users, while only recording two transactions on the actual Bitcoin blockchain. As such, the Lightning Network is sometimes hailed \u2013 either implicitly or explicitly \u2013 as the savior of Bitcoin that will solve all scalability issues.\n\nWhile the Lightning Network could, indeed, potentially help solve the scaling problem to a large extent, it is quite an exaggeration to claim that no further block-size increase will be needed at all. If Bitcoin does grow to its full potential, and the Lightning Network is used by billions around the globe on a daily basis, these users will still need to transact on the Bitcoin blockchain in order to open and close channels once in a while. If that happens, it\u2019s safe to assume that 1 megabyte blocks will be too limiting.\n\nIn fact, Poon and Dryja acknowledge that the block-size limit would need to be raised in their white paper, estimating:\n\n\u201cIf we presume that a decentralized payment network exists and one person will make 3 blockchain transactions per year on average, Bitcoin will be able to support over 35 million users with 1MB blocks in ideal circumstances (assuming 2000 transactions per MB). This is quite limited, and an increase of the block size may be necessary to support everyone in the world using Bitcoin.... While it may appear as though this system will mitigate the block size increases in the short term, if it achieves global scale, it will necessitate a block size increase in the long term.\u201d\n\nIt should also be noted that the Lightning Network is not merely intended as a solution for scalability. It could also securely enable instant confirmations for the first time, and make microtransactions worth fractions of a cent economically feasible again. In fact, if these properties draw in a lot of new Bitcoin users, deployment of the Lightning Network might actually pose a challenge for Bitcoin\u2019s scalability issue on the shorter term.\n\nMyth #10: The Lightning Network is an easy fix.\n\nWhile debating the block-size issue, some on the decentralist side contend that the Lightning Network will simply solve most of Bitcoin's scalability problems. This sometimes makes the solution sound like an easy fix. It is not.\n\nFor one, the Lightning protocol itself is still a work in progress. Rusty Russell, Poon, Dryja and others are doing their best to realize the project(s), but this is a long and slow process. Even the concept itself is not set in stone yet, and several problems still need solving. As such, it\u2019s not quite certain the the Lightning Network will indeed work as promised.\n\nFurthermore, and as stated above, the Bitcoin protocol itself will need improvements for the Lightning Network to be deployed securely. Some of the required fixes, moreover, are not that easy to implement, and, much like the Lightning Network itself, are still a work in progress. As such, they might take quite some time to deploy \u2013 if they are ever deployed at all.\n\nLastly, wallet software will need to adjust as well. The most likely outcome here would be that individual wallets \u2013 Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin XT, Electrum, mobile wallets, etc. \u2013 will include some kind of add-on. Users would then have the option to make a blockchain transaction, or use the Lightning Network instead. But like much of the rest of the Lightning Network, specifics of how this will work or what it would look like exactly are not yet fully flushed out.\n\nMyth #11: The Lightning Network is urgently needed.\n\nThis 11th \u201cmyth\u201d is more of a controversy than a myth.\n\nIt should first be noted that it is hard to say with certainty how urgently instant and (dirt) cheap transactions are needed. These properties have not really existed on the Bitcoin network so far, making it hard to asses how much demand there will be for these properties.\n\nIt is more commonly assumed that the Lightning Network is urgently needed to address scalability issues. The fact that the Lightning Network is far from ready is one reason some progressives have urged an increase in the block-size limit instead. If blocks fill up, they argue, fees might rise to undesirable levels, transactions will be too slow to confirm (or not confirm at all), and Bitcoin could even become overloaded. With no alternatives such as the Lightning Network, the outcome would be bad \u2013 perhaps even devastating.\n\nAs stated above, it is definitely true that the Lightning Network is far from ready. Luckily, however, blocks are not yet filling up either, at least not in such a way that it causes great trouble. Even Bitcoin XT developers Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen \u2013 the two most prominent advocates of bigger blocks \u2013 acknowledge that it will probably take another year before this starts to happen. (Others believe it will take longer.) That means the Lightning Network probably has at least another year to deploy and gain traction.\n\nWhether that is enough time is debatable. In one of his blog posts, Hearn\nargues\n\nthat there are no credible technical proposals that could gain widespread adoption within one year, including the Lightning Network. Others, however, have been a bit more optimistic. While a year is not an awful lot of time to deploy something like the Lightning Network on a large scale, Bitcoin moves fast, and it\u2019s not impossible either.\n\nBut more importantly, many on the decentralist side of the debate\nargue\n\nthat full blocks wouldn\u2019t be that big of a problem in the first place. Fees may rise a bit, and not all transactions would confirm within the first available block, but that would be fine. If this is true, it might take\nyears\nbefore the Lightning Network is really, urgently needed for scalability reasons.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 10, "day": 14}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nIn what could be a landmark case for Bitcoin in the EU, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has announced that it will make its decision on the VAT-status of virtual currency exchanges next Thursday. The verdict, which is the climax of an originally Swedish court dispute, could have far-reaching implications for bitcoin users and companies in all \n28 EU-member states\n.\n\nIn essence, the ECJ will decide whether bitcoin exchanges should be subject to VAT (Value Added Tax). Specifically, as requested by the Swedish high court, the ECJ will answer \ntwo questions\n:\n\n\u201cIs Article 2(1) of the VAT Directive to be interpreted as meaning that transactions in the form of what has been designated as the exchange of virtual currency for traditional currency and vice versa, which is effected for consideration added by the supplier when the exchange rates are determined, constitute the supply of a service effected for consideration?\u201d\n\nAnd:\n\n\u201cIf the answer to the first question is in the affirmative, is Article135(1) to be interpreted as meaning that the above mentioned exchange transactions are tax exempt?\u201d\n\nSpeaking to \nBitcoin Magazine\n, Dutch fiscalist for law firm Baker & McKenzie and VAT-expert \nRoger van de Berg\n\n explained what the implications of the court ruling will be.\n\nVan de Berg:\n\n\u201cStrictly speaking, the case is about bitcoin exchange services. It's not about bitcoin itself, it's not about bitcoin mining, it's not about paying with bitcoin, or anything else. The court will decide whether exchange services fall within the scope of VAT-based law \u2013 that's the first question. If the ECJ decides that bitcoin exchange services do in fact fall within this scope, the second question will answer whether a VAT exemption should apply.\u201d\n\nIf the ECJ rules that a bitcoin exchange does fall within scope of VAT-based law, and also decides that a VAT exemption will \nnot\n apply, it could mean two things. The most likely outcome is that bitcoin exchanges will be required to pay VAT over the spread; the difference in price of buying and selling bitcoin from which they profit. But another \u2013 less likely \u2013 outcome could be that the value of the sale itself is subject to VAT. Since VAT in different EU member states is anywhere between 15 and 27 percent \u2013 depending on the country \u2013 this would effectively mean that it would cost an additional 15 to 27 percent to purchase bitcoin.\n\nBut while the questions that are to be answered by the ECJ strictly speaking apply only to bitcoin exchangers, it is possible that the answers could have even more far-reaching implications as well.\n\n\u201cIn order to answer the question regarding exchange services, the ECJ might reason that it first needs to assess what such an exchange is actually doing and how the underlying assets should be qualified,\u201d Van de Berg explained. \u201cAs such, it might also investigate the VAT treatment of virtual currencies and thus decide whether or not bitcoin itself is subject to VAT. If that happens, we have a clear answer from the ECJ of where bitcoin stands for VAT purposes within the EU. This would then apply to all bitcoin-related activities, including mining, spending and more.\u201d\n\nCurrently, different EU member states uphold their own VAT-laws regarding virtual currencies. Some charge VAT, others do not, and yet others have not taken in any official position so far. With the ruling next week, however, all national virtual currency-related VAT laws will be overruled by the ECJ, in effect creating a uniform fiscal policy for all of the EU. This decision will be binding to all EU member states, and can only be overturned if overruling law is made by the European Commission in Brussels.\n\nIn July of this year, the Advocate General of the ECJ, Juliane Kokott, \nurged\n\n the court not to apply VAT on bitcoin purchases. While Kokott acknowledged that bitcoin is not legal tender, she did argue that it is comparable to money. As such, Kokott believes it does not in itself add value to the economy (which VAT is meant to tax), and should for tax purposes be treated like foreign currencies instead. While the advice of its Advocate General is in no way binding, the Luxembourg-based ECJ does often follow it.\n\nIt would be very favorable for the European Bitcoin community if the ECJ does follow Kokott's reasoning, according to Van de Berg.\n\n\u201cIf bitcoin is not taxable for VAT purposes, EU citizens can transact with each other much more freely,\u201d Van de Berg explained. \u201cIt would put bitcoin on a level playing field with fiat currency in that respect. I think that's essential for the growth of Bitcoin. If, on the other hand, we're all going to have to tax each other every time we use bitcoin, that would put significant damper on adoption. And a non-taxable status would be much better from a compliance perspective as well. Having to keep track of all bitcoin payments for tax purposes would be a compliance nightmare.\u201d\n\nThe particular questions are brought before the ECJ as part of a Swedish dispute. Specifically, it concerns David Hedqvist, who planned to operate a Swedish bitcoin brokerage on his website \nbitcoin.se\n\n back in 2012. Hedqvist asked the Swedish tax authority whether his business would be subject to VAT, and the tax authority in 2013 decided it was not. The Swedish tax office, however, disagreed, and believed that commission and fees should be subject to VAT. The case ended up at the Supreme Administrative Court in Sweden, which in turn decided to ask for a ruling from the ECJ on how to interpret the common EU VAT directive a \nyear ago\n.\n\nThanks to David Hedqvist for providing details regarding the court case.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 10, "day": 16}

Those developers who are interested can also receive accreditation as a Certified Bitcoin Professional from the CryptoCurrency Certification Consortium (C4).\n\"It's very important to increase knowledge about development in Bitcoin, now more than ever,\" Executive Director Bruce Fenton told Bitcoin Magazine, \"The aim of DevCore is to help develop developers and to increase overall knowledge about Bitcoin Core and the important work that is being done.\"\nEducation and development aside, its hard to imagine that the blocksize debate won\u2019t come up or even dominate some of the conference discussions.\u00a0\nThe Bitcoin block size debate about how the Bitcoin network can support increased transactions without compromising the original values of decentralization and democratic control, has dominated forums, chat rooms and social media for months now.\n\"Given the timing and importance of the blocksize discussion we will discuss that as well, although it's not the primary focus of the meeting,\" \n\nFenton said.\n\nFor those following the debate, it\u2019s not so much whether to increase the blocksize anymore, but by what method and by how much.\u00a0 At least six possible alternative solutions are now on the table as outlined here.\n\nJeff Garzik, one of the Bitcoin Core early developers has been an active participant in the debate and has proposed BIP 102, a patch to Bitcoin software that would use a hard fork to raise the block size limit to 2 MB.\nHe sees the conference as not just a day to revisit the block size debate but also to catch up with other developers and reassess where the Bitcoin movement is heading.\u00a0\n\"I\u2019m looking forward to discussing current and future issues regarding Bitcoin development, including block size and other hot topics,\u201d \n Garzik told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nCertified Bitcoin Professional accreditation will be available\n\nC4, the CryptoCurrency Certification Consortium is a nonprofit organization that provides certifications to professionals who perform cryptocurrency-related services.\u00a0\nC4 is holding two workshops at DevCore \u2013 one led by Andreas Antonopoulos and C4 President Michael Perklin will outline the specifics of their CryptoCurrency Security Standard program.\n\nThe other workshop will give attendees the opportunity to write the CCSS exam so they can walk away from DevCore as an accredited Certified Bitcoin Professional.

The Internet of Money.\u201d\n\n\nA press release\nnotes that Uphold wants to be the world's leading cloud-based money platform, connecting the legacy and fragmented financial ecosystem with the future of money and finance. Uphold will be a members-only, member-to-member financial service for individuals, businesses, charities (including nonprofits and nongovernment organizations) and developers.\n\nWatson, former Nike CIO and member of the exclusive Fortune 40 Under 40 list, joined Bitreserve\nas president and chief operating officer earlier in 2015.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI am thrilled to join Bitreserve at such a pivotal moment in the evolution of cloud money and financial technology,\u201d he said.\u00a0\n\nFounded by CNET founder Halsey Minor in 2013, Bitreserve launched innovative features to shield its customers from the volatility of bitcoin by instantly locking deposits to a fiat currency selected by the customer, such as the U.S. dollar.\u00a0\n\n\u201cBitreserve is on a mission to democratize the use of digital currency by protecting businesses and consumers from the risks inherent in the bitcoin model,\u201d noted a Forbes\nreview quoted on the Bitreserve website.\n\nIn March, Bitreserve launched\ntwo new \u201cbitcurrencies\u201d: the bitrupee (BitINR) and bitpeso (BitMXN), pegged to two key developing world currencies \u2013 the Indian rupee and the Mexican peso \u2013 that allow Indian and Mexican customers to hold their local currencies on Bitreserve.\n\n\u201cToday, Bitreserve takes its next great step forward on the journey to transform global financial services for the benefit of everyone, everywhere,\u201d says Watson. \u201cTogether with the entire company, I\u2019m proud and excited to announce that Bitreserve has become Uphold. But that\u2019s just the beginning. We have additional exciting updates and announcements to share, from new market entries to new products and services and broader changes at our company.\u201d\u00a0\n\nNow, customers in 30 European Union countries, as well as Switzerland, can deposit money into Uphold via bank transfer or from credit and debit cards. In November, Uphold will begin to roll out its services to customers in the United States and China (limited beta), followed by India in January 2016 (limited beta).\u00a0\n\nMembers can fund their Uphold accounts by linking any bank account, debit and/or credit card (Visa and MasterCard initially), in addition to bitcoin and \u2018the Voxel\u2019 or \u2018Voxels,\u2019 a new form of virtual currency that the company and a partner will announce in the next few days.\n\nIn December, Uphold plans to roll out multiple card and payment products, both physical and virtual (limited beta release). Members, based on their location and jurisdiction, will be able to choose among Visa, MasterCard or Discover to pay for goods and services, online or in person, using cards directly linked to their Uphold accounts.\n\nWatson\u2019s post emphasizes that Uphold is not a bank and doesn\u2019t lend or leverage members\u2019 funds.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOur members can rest assured that value held in Uphold is 100 percent safe and secure and can be withdrawn, at any time, regardless of what is happening in the global economy,\u201d says Watson. He adds that Uphold services will be mostly free, with some fees that will apply in special cases. For example, a fee of 2.75 percent will apply to members who choose to fund their Uphold account with a debit and/or credit card.\n\nFortune\nnotes\nthat Bitreserve, now Uphold, is de-emphasizing the role of bitcoin in its business model and operations. That is shown by the new name without \u201cbit\u201d \u2013 \u201cthat oh-so-common prefix amongst digital currency startups\u201d \u2013 and the new emphasis on financial services linked to traditional credit cards and bank accounts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be surprised if bitcoin is here in five years,\u201d Watson told Fortune\n. \u201cThe value of bitcoin isn\u2019t the currency, but the technology. I think once the world becomes more accustomed and attuned to the platform of bitcoin, the noise will go away, and the currency will go away, too.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe company\u2019s founder Halsey Minor, too, predicts that bitcoin as a currency \u201cwill get destroyed.\u201d\n\nMinor and Watson\u2019s remarks are certainly attuned to the prevailing mood in the financial services industry, which focuses on the advantages of using the blockchain technology for faster, cheaper and traceable transactions while considering the bitcoin currency as a temporary inconvenience. At the same time, it is worth bearing in mind that the current system \u2013 blockchain technology plus bitcoin currency \u2013 is proven to work.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 10, "day": 16}

It's that simple.\u201d\nt0.com is an assumed name for Medici, Inc., which is a majority-owned financial technology subsidiary of Overstock. The Medici project was first announced by Byrne in 2014 at Inside Bitcoins Las Vegas.\u00a0 Overstock is a large online retailer based in Salt Lake City, Utah. The company, which went public in 2002 at an IPO price of $13 and now trades at $17, is likely to enjoy first mover advantages in the novel and very promising sector of crypto-securities. In fact, the crypto-stock exchange could sidestep traditional stock exchanges such as NYSE and NASDAQ and issue corporate stock directly over the Internet. T0 partnered with a number of banks, including the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), which Relbanks ranked as the largest bank in the world, to test its technology.\nIn July, Byrne said to expect further announcements about the t0 platform, and that it presents an \u201cextraordinary opportunity\u201d for Overstock because it has the potential to be disruptive.\nNow, Overstock announced that it successfully completed another production beta test of its t0 software, by successfully using the bitcoin blockchain to record evidence of compliance with SEC Regulation SHO before a trader can engage in a short sale. Mandatory compliance with Regulation SHO, which was adopted to update short sale regulations, began in 2005.\nEarlier this week, hedge fund Clique Fund, LP, participated in the t0 testing to purchase locates for all 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks.\u00a0\n\"The blockchain is the most important financial development of our lifetimes,\" said Byrne. \"While others theorize about the innovations this new technology can usher in, t0 is taking action and proving the concept daily, including using it to crack open the notoriously inaccessible black box of securities lending. This is further evidence of the world-historical potential of distributed, cryptographically secured ledgers.\u201d\nByrne added that, once up and running, each Pre-borrow Assured Token will provide the purchaser a valid locate satisfying the SEC's Regulation SHO requirements.\nPre-borrowed Assured Tokens (PATs) convert the rights to lend a third-party\u2019s money into cryptographic tokens that are auctioned off at the end of the day, and reverse auctioned at the beginning of the day. PATs will be auctioned nightly in a Dutch auction using t0 software and the transaction will be recorded on the blockchain. Access to t0.com's PATs, when available, will be limited to qualified institutional buyers that are also qualified purchasers.\n\"As I have said publicly ad nauseam, I have no objection in principle with short selling when done legally,\" said Byrne. \"Our introduction of the Pre-borrow Assured Token will solve a problem for the beneficial owners, by bringing their inventory into a transparent market; it will solve a problem for the short seller, who will be able to borrow in a transparent market; and it will solve a problem for regulators, who for several years have taken a more aggressive stance regarding this mischief than they did a decade ago, I feel obliged to acknowledge. Unfortunately, a few bad apples spoil the barrel. That barrel needs a good scrubbing, and that's what our Pre-borrow Assured Token will do.\"\nIt appears that Overstock\u2019s t0 platform is advancing steadily toward fully operational status, and could have a big and disruptive impact on securities trading.", "year": 2015, "month": 10, "day": 16}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nUpdate: Carl Mark Force IV was sentenced to 6.5 years in prison today. While Force's defense asked for a sentence beneath statutory guidelines as it contended that Force's behavior was caused by alcoholism and mental health issues, Judge Richard Seeborg is said to have been highly skeptical of this excuse. In addition to the prison sentence, Force will need to pay $340,000 in restitution.\n\nThanks to Motherboard's Sarah Jeong (@sarahjeong) for reporting on the scene.\n\nThe U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California is set to sentence 46-year-old Silk Road investigator Carl Mark Force IV this\n\nMonday\n.\n\nIt seems certain that the corrupt DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) agent will need to spend time behind bars. After having been arrested in\n\nMarch\n,\nhe pleaded guilty to money laundering, obstruction of justice and extortion\n\nearlier this summer\n.\nLast week, prosecutors revealed they seek to lock the former law enforcement officer up for seven years, which they say is the maximum penalty within the applicable sentencing guidelines.\n\nIn a 10-page\n\nsentencing memorandum\n,\nthe prosecution explains why only a high-end sentence would be appropriate for Force.\n\nReason #1: Force betrayed public trust.\n\nThe most important reason the prosecutors want to go hard on Force is that they believe the corrupt agent abused the public trust and tarnished the reputation of law enforcement in the process. The memorandum, which opens with a translated Latin maxim (\u201cCorruption of the best is the worst\u201d), argues that Force brutely violated the mandate given to him. A serious crime requiring serious sentencing, the prosecutors contend, not in the least because it reflects bad on all government officials.\n\nAccording to the prosecution:\n\n\"In providing the defendant with a gun and a badge, the government entrusted him to act in a manner consistent with standards becoming a sworn law enforcement officer, namely to protect and serve the public. Conduct like Force\u2019s undermines public confidence in law enforcement and threatens the credibility of the entire criminal justice system. Unfortunately, it does not take more than one or two corrupt federal agents to overshadow the consistent and heroic work done by 99.9% of their colleagues. The national media doesn\u2019t publish articles about the agents who are the first responders in active shooter incidents, who risk their lives in undercover capacities, who respond to live hostage situations,who root out financial fraud and uncover terrorist plots \u2013 they publish articles about the corrupt behavior of people like Carl Force and [corrupt U.S. Secret Service agent] Shaun Bridges. Simply put, when the badge is tarnished it impacts every single law enforcement officer who wears it and every citizen who relies on it for protection.\"\nReason #2: Force's conduct was long-lasting and consistent.\n\nThe second reason prosecutors are aiming for a maximum penalty within the applicable sentencing guidelines is that Force's criminal conduct was not a one-off, but a persistent behavioral pattern. Indeed, the corrupt agent's story can only be described as a long-lasting, bizarre, and incredible amassment of pathological disregard of the law. It's not without reason that Twentieth Century Fox recently\n\nbought\n\nthe movie rights to his Silk Road investigation...\n\nAccording to the sentencing memorandum:\n\n\"This Court comes across plenty of defendants who have committed a single \u2013 yet significant \u2013 error in judgment who might deserve a break when it comes time for sentencing. This is not one of those defendants. His crimes do not represent a \u201cone-off\u201d where he experienced a momentary lapse of judgment. Instead, Force committed crimes over the course of many months (if not years) during which he had time to reflect on what he was doing over and over again. Yet instead of ceasing his misconduct after one incident, he continued with impunity until he was caught. His was an extremely calculated effort, designed to avoid detection for as long as possible, ironically using the very skills (e.g. encryption, Tor, etc.) that he learned on the job and on the public\u2019s dime.\"\nReason #3: Force jeopardized the Silk Road investigation.\n\nThe third reason why prosecutors are not going easy on Force is that he greatly jeopardized the Silk Road investigation with his misconduct. Force was part of the Baltimore Silk Road Task Force, which was tasked to uncover the digital black market and arrest its operator Ross Ulbricht, AKA Dread Pirate Roberts. But by breaking all protocol, Force could have ruined a years-long project, spanning four government agencies (the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Postal Inspection Service, Homeland Security Investigations, and his own Drug Enforcement Agency).\n\nIndeed, after the news of Force's arrest broke, Ulbricht's lawyer\n\ncontended\n\nthat his client was denied a fair trial. Which, by that time, had already ended, of course, with Ulbricht found guilty.\n\nIn Force's sentencing memorandum, the prosecutors write:\n\n\"Given Force\u2019s role as the undercover agent on that case in communication with Ulbricht, it would have been obvious to Force as a longtime federal agent that he would be a key, if not the key, witness for the government in any future prosecution in Maryland. In stealing money, creating unauthorized personas and having encrypted\nultra vires\ncommunications, Force acted with reckless disregard for the potential for his actions to jeopardize the very case he was tasked with building. Rather than working to take down the Silk Road \u2013 what he was being paid with taxpayer dollars to do \u2013 Force lined his own pockets.\"\nReason #4: A lengthy sentence should serve as a warning to would-be corrupt agents.\n\nThe fourth and final reason prosecutors believe Force should be locked up for seven years is that such a sentence would send a signal to his colleagues \u2013 both at the DEA and at other government agencies \u2013 as well as the public.\n\nThe prosecutors contend that Force's prison sentence should act as a deterrence for would-be corrupt officials. The sentencing memorandum reads:\n\n\"The Court should send a message that this kind of conduct will be met with a harsh penalty in the form of a high-end prison sentence. A message of leniency communicates to other potentially corrupt government officials that the possibility of prison might be worth the risk in order to profit several hundred thousands or millions of dollars.\"\nAnd finally, the prosecution believes that a significant prison sentence should show the American public that the criminal justice system works. Not just against criminals among the population, but also against criminals within the government itself.\n\nThe prosecution argues:\n\n\"At the time of his criminal activity, the defendant\u2019s legitimate work with the DEA was busting drug dealers, arresting them and charging them with drug crimes that carry significant custody time. In the midst of all of this he was stealing money and property from others. In his off-time, he was investing the proceeds of that criminal activity in a business that he worked for on the side, without approval, and striking movie deals and book deals with a Hollywood studio. It is critical that people understand and believe that when a law enforcement agent gets caught doing these kinds of things, he will be dealt with severely by the system of which he was once a part.\"\nThanks to CoinDesk for publishing the sentencing memorandum.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 10, "day": 19}

Vaultoro enables anyone to easily enter the global economy securely by utilizing the native Internet currency, bitcoin, and removing the extreme volatility by combining the security of assigned gold bullion. This will go very far towards ending poverty by including a potential 5 billion people who have no real access to banking.\u201d\n\n\nVaultoro is a real-time Bitcoin gold exchange that allows its users to convert their bitcoin instantly to gold and back, alleviating volatility risk for bitcoin users. Its \u201cbank-independent trading\u201d allows users to trade gold in amounts as small as 0.001 gram.\n\nThe third bitcoin finalist, Safello, is a Swedish-based exchange that works with a wide network of European banks providing direct payment options, allowing customers to buy and sell bitcoin instantly, thereby avoiding exposure to market volatility.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s most noticeable about this Open Challenge is the sheer amount Bitcoin selected,\u201d Frank Schuil, CEO of Safello, told\u00a0\nBitcoin Magazine\n. \u201cIt shows the dedication from BBVA to embrace blockchain technology. With regards to our selection, of course\u00a0\nour recent announcement with Barclays\n\n\u00a0is sparking interest from other financial institutions. The fact that we are essentially building a new type of bank on top of blockchain technology is sparking interest.\u201d\n\n\nEverledger joins\u00a0\nBitNexo\n\n, winner of the Latin American regional competition, as the second Bitcoin-based company to take home a BBVA award this year.\n\n\n\u201cIn BitNexo\u2019s mission to bring simplicity, speed and savings to cross border payments for SMBs through the use of blockchain technology, we had the honor of sharing the stage with 13 other amazing FinTech Startups from all around Latin America,\u201d said Darren Camas, CEO and co-founder of BitNexo\n\u00a0in a blog post\n\n. \u201cTo say I was impressed with the level of competition is an understatement.\u201d\n\n\nInformation about all 15 finalists can be found on the\u00a0\nBBVA Open Talent competition website\n\n.\n\n", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 24}

Though the disclaimer \u201cThe views are not necessarily those of the Bank of England or the Monetary Policy Committee\u201d ensures plausible deniability, Haldane\u2019s talk seems to indicate that the BoE is at least seriously considering the possibility.\n\nHaldane is chief economist at the BoE and executive director of monetary analysis and statistics. Listed by\u00a0Time Magazine\n\u00a0in 2014 as one of the 100 most influential people in the world, Haldane is a member of BoE\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee and oversees research and statistics across the bank.\n\nHaldane focuses on the inability of central banks to set negative interest rates to stimulate economic growth, which hinders the effectiveness of monetary policy and is known as the\u00a0Zero Lower Bound\n\u00a0(ZLB) problem.\n\n\u201cA central bank cannot reduce nominal interest rates below zero,\u201d explained a 2014IMF working paper\n\u00a0cited by Haldane. \u201cThis constraint arises from the existence of an asset, cash, with a guaranteed return of zero. A negative interest rate would mean that someone lends $100 and receives less than $100 in the future. Such a loan would never occur, because the lender could do better by putting cash in a safe deposit box.\u201d\n\nTherefore, Haldane suggests looking for technological means for implementing a negative interest rate on physical currency. More than a century ago, German economist\u00a0Silvio Gesell\n\u00a0proposed a stamp tax on currency to generate a negative interest rate. Modern variants of the stamp tax on currency have been proposed \u2013 for example, by randomly invalidating banknotes by serial number.\n\nAnother possibility is to abolish paper currency, which would also represent a way to fight criminal activities that rely on cash exchange.\n\nYet another possibility would be to issue government-backed currency in an electronic rather than paper form.\n\n\u201cThis would preserve the social convention of a state-issued unit of account and medium of exchange, albeit with currency now held in digital rather than physical wallets,\u201d says Haldane.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cBut it would allow negative interest rates to be levied on currency easily and speedily, so relaxing the ZLB constraint.\u201d\n\nHaldane observes that the technology underpinning digital currencies has changed rapidly over the past few years, due to the emergence of Bitcoin and crypto-currencies.\n\n\u201cWhat I think is now reasonably clear is that the distributed payment technology embodied in Bitcoin has real potential,\u201d says Haldane. \u201cOn the face of it, it solves a deep problem in monetary economics:\u00a0\u00a0\nhow to establish trust \u2013 the essence of money \u2013 in a distributed network.\u00a0\u00a0\nBitcoin\u2019s \u201cblockchain\u201d technology appears to offer\u00a0an imaginative solution\n\u00a0to that distributed trust problem.\u201d\n\nWhether a variant of this technology could support central bank-issued digital currency, and whether the public would accept it as a substitute for paper currency, are, according to Haldane, open questions that do not have easy answers.\n\n\u201cThat is why work on central bank-issued digital currencies forms a core part of the bank\u2019s current research agenda,\u201d concludes Haldane.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cAlthough the hurdles to implementation are high, so too is the potential prize if the ZLB constraint could be slackened.\u00a0\u00a0\nPerhaps central bank money is ripe for its own great technological leap forward, prompted by the pressing demands of the ZLB.\u201d\n\nIn a previous presentation, Haldane\u00a0stated\n\u00a0that digital currencies are \u201charder money\u201d than a gold standard, because \u201csustained adoption would see ongoing deflation.\u201d A few months ago the Bank of England published a research paper titled \u201cInnovations in payment technologies and the emergence of digital currencies\n.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe distributed ledger is a genuine technological innovation that demonstrates that digital records can be held securely without any central authority,\u201d reads the conclusion of the paper.\u00a0\u00a0\nA recent U.K. Treasury document titled \u201cDigital Currencies: Response to the Call for Information\n\u201d shows that the British government is interested in supporting and understanding blockchain-based digital fintech, and understands the potential benefits it could bring to society.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 23}

However, there are many new players trying to circumvent regulatory boundaries, or innovate from inside, instead of trying to change the regulations altogether. Innovation, instead of regulatory change, is a faster, cheaper and easier approach to change in many innovators' and entrepreneurs' eyes.\n\nOne of those companies is XBT Provider. In May, it launched the world\u2019s first Bitcoin-based asset \u201cBitcoin Tracker One\u201d and just recently announced its second product, a Euro-denominated Bitcoin-based security, Bitcoin Tracker EUR, available through Nasdaq Nordic on October 5.\n\n\"We are proud to offer a Euro-denominated instrument to meet demand from investors worldwide,\u201d said Alexander Marsh, CEO of XBT Provider.\n\nThe demand for Bitcoin has seen very high growth since its inception in 2009 but this demand has been accessible only for private individuals or investors who have had the flexibility to invest outside of regulated exchanges. Looking at the demand from institutional investors, this might rapidly be changing and, according to Marsh, \u201cBitcoin Tracker One has during periods been among the top three most-traded ETNs on Nasdaq Nordic since launch.\u201d\n\nAttractive investment to diversify portfolio\n\nThrough the opening of Bitcoin-based assets accessible on the regular stock exchange, XBT Provider is looking to get institutional investors to understand the benefit of having Bitcoin in their portfolios, but more education is needed. \u201cOne of the advantages of diversifying your portfolio with bitcoin is that it\u2019s still uncorrelated with other assets.\u201d Johan Wattenstr\u00f6m, Partner at XBT Provider explains. \u201cAdditionally, a critical number of triggers and catalysts in the Bitcoin ecosystem are now in place for a further take-off in the price.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe volatility that has followed Bitcoin has been seen as both a blessing and a curse. For the regular investor, volatility in an asset is often seen as something negative that has to be avoided to have a stable portfolio. However, volatility for the institutional investors, and crafty traders, is instead seen as something very positive since they can capture the upward price movements and make a profit from them.\u00a0\n\nBitcoin no longer an untouchable asset\n\nThere are a few benefits for investors to invest in ETNs instead of directly in the underlying asset or in an ETF. First, ETNs can track one unique asset without needing to diversify its holdings such as an ETF often must. Additionally, it can increase liquidity in otherwise highly illiquid assets. Lastly, it can give investors access to assets that are otherwise too hard to manage or require too much prior knowledge to maintain properly.\u00a0\n\nThis makes ETNs a very common choice for investors who would like to invest in niche assets without needing to spend time and resources learning and understanding the underlying asset's technical aspects.\n\nFrom Sweden to the world\n\nBitcoin Tracker One is denominated in Swedish krona, which, being a minor currency in the global financial markets, has led to some still being hesitant to invest. Bitcoin Tracker EUR aims at changing this by making the steps for investing in bitcoin as few as possible. Being denominated in euros, it can lower fees and make bitcoin much more accessible to the global investor.\n\nCompared to bitcoin, Bitcoin Tracker One has seen incredible growth since its launch a few months ago and is currently holding more than 15,000 bitcoin. This opens up the question whether the next step to Bitcoin\u2019s growth will come from the institutional side and not from the private investor. Additionally, it has followed the price of bitcoin on a 1:1 ratio consistently, which shows that, if managed properly, bitcoin can be considered as any other financial asset that institutional investors could consider investing in.\n\n\n", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 28}

The funds are first transferred to a cryptocurrency exchange, then converted to a cryptocurrency such as bitcoin, then sent to another exchange, and finally converted into another currency for the recipient. In other words, BoA wants to patent the concept of using a cryptocurrency as a transparent intermediate step for fiat currency transfers.\n\u201cA system includes a memory and a processor,\u201d reads the abstract of the filing. \u201cThe processor is coupled to the memory and causes the system to receive an electronic request for a fund transfer and initiate a debit of a first amount of a first currency from a customer account. In response to determining using cryptocurrency is optimal, the processor can transfer the first amount of the first currency into an account associated with a first cryptocurrency exchange and initiate the purchase of a first quantity of a cryptocurrency from the first cryptocurrency exchange. The processor can transfer the first quantity of the cryptocurrency to a second cryptocurrency exchange and initiate the sale of the first quantity of the cryptocurrency at the second cryptocurrency exchange. The processor is further able to initiate the transfer of at least a portion of the resulting currency to a recipient.\u201d\nThe system includes means to determine which transfer method \u2013 including cryptocurrency \u2013 is optimal in a given case. The decision strategy is based on time factors, price factors, exchange rates, fees charged by third parties, volatility and other relevant information. If using cryptocurrency is found to be optimal, the system includes means to determine which cryptocurrency or exchange should be used. For example, the system \u201cmay choose a particular cryptocurrency exchange because the cryptocurrency is priced favorably (e.g., cheap if purchasing, expensive if selling) or because the cryptocurrency exchange has a relationship with the enterprise.\u201d\nBoA claims that the system described in the patent application can reduce or eliminate disadvantages and problems associated with traditional wire transfers. The application notes that enterprises handle a large number of foreign wire transfer requests on a daily basis, and foreign transactions are becoming more common. The BoA filing is focused on making cross-border transactions faster: \u201cIt may be desirable to conduct a foreign wire transfer in less time than what current foreign wire transfer systems allow.\u201d\nThe proposed BoA system can bypass traditional wire services, reduce the dependency on third party networks, and increase the reliability of fund transfers. Cryptocurrency-mediated transfers permit completing a foreign fund transfer in less time than traditional wire transfers, avoiding delays that may be caused by third party systems and services. Furthermore, transferring funds using a cryptocurrency reduces the need to transfer customer data to third-party systems, thus increasing control and security of customer data.\nAs usual with patents, the application tries to cover all possible technical implementations and use cases, and defines cryptocurrencies in a generic way. \u201cA cryptocurrency is typically a peer-to-peer, decentralized, digital currency whose implementation relies on the principles of cryptography to validate transactions and generate the currency itself,\u201d reads the filing. \u201cSome examples of cryptocurrencies are: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple, Peercoin, and Dogecoin. In some instances, a cryptocurrency, such as MintChip, may be backed by a government (e.g., Canada).\u201d\nToday, many banks and financial operators are warming up to the potential of digital currencies to reduce the time and cost of fund transfers, especially cross-border transfers. The BoA patent application tries to cover both existing and future cryptocurrencies, and all systems that use a cryptocurrency as a transparent intermediate step for fund transfers in fiat currencies.

{"title": "Building a Risk Market for the Digital Age Using Bitcoin ", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/building-a-risk-market-for-the-digital-age-using-bitcoin-1443625202/", "birthday": "Sep 30, 2015  11:00 AM EST", "date": "2015-09-30 16:00:00", "content": "This is a guest post by Michael Folkson.\n\nThe Internet was originally developed as a network for information exchange. Now, a multitude of entrepreneurs and software developers are building the Internet for value exchange. The next logical progression is to build the Internet for risk exchange.\u00a0\n\nJust as units of currency can be transferred to a third party, insurance contracts transfer risk exposures to a third party. Blockchain technology has the potential to radically transform how the insurance industry operates and how risk exposures are shared and distributed.\u00a0\n\nWhile Bitcoin offers a protocol for peer-to-peer value transmission bypassing the traditional banking system, an insurance industry leveraging a public blockchain presents an opportunity for individuals and entities to retain, share or transfer risk exposures without the requirement for risk exposures to sit on an insurance company\u2019s balance sheet.\u00a0\n\nScience fiction frequently offers inspiration for what an industry could look like in the future. The short speculative fiction titled \"Know When to Hold \u2019Em\" by K.G. Jewell is a somewhat dystopian vision of futuristic insurance, but it does explain how the user interface of a peer-to-peer insurance market could operate.\u00a0\n\nIn the story, the lead character, Jonas, acts as an insurer on the platform MicroRisk. Among the microrisks he chooses to provide insurance coverage for are vacation sickness, exam results, fashion (two individuals wearing the same outfit at an event) and being stood up on a first date. He is required to post collateral into his MicroRisk account before insuring a risk and is able to audit claims before paying out on them. The policyholder\u2019s premium and the insurer\u2019s collateral are frozen in escrow until the contract closed.\u00a0\n\nSome of these risks may be difficult to price due to limited data and increased moral hazard. However, the story does stir the imagination when envisaging what personal risks could be insured if the requirement to go through a conventional insurance company was lifted.\u00a0\n\nThe transfer and distribution of risk dates back to at least to the second millennium B.C. In approximately 1750 B.C. Mediterranean sailing merchants paid their lender an additional sum to agree to terminate their liability conditional on the shipment being stolen or lost at sea.\u00a0\n\nThere are a number of participants in today\u2019s insurance industry. Brokers act as intermediaries to connect insurance buyers and sellers. Underwriters determine the premiums that should be charged in conjunction with the actuaries who also estimate the reserves required to meet future claims on an ongoing basis. Claims adjusters verify the legitimacy of insurance claims and assess the size of the payout.\u00a0\n\nThere are many parallels between the banking and insurance industries with both sectors rewarded for accepting risk exposures. Rather than lending out funds and (hopefully) receiving them back at a future point in time, insurance companies receive funds in advance and return them contingent on future events.\u00a0\n\nThe peer-to-peer lending model has thrived in recent years with companies such as Lending Club, Prosper and Zopa facilitating more than $1 billion of loans between individuals.\u00a0\n\nIts success is at least partly explained by re-establishing a direct link between investors and specific credit risk exposures at a time of economic uncertainty, sovereign debt crises and complex too-big-to-fail banking institutions. These direct credit risk exposures allow an investor to diversify her overall portfolio, and there are minimal infrastructure costs in comparison to traditional retail banks.\u00a0\n\nSimilarly, a peer-to-peer insurance platform re-establishes a direct link between investors and specific insurance risk exposures. Today\u2019s insurance companies are so large, complex and heavily regulated that the direct link between an investor and specific insurance risks has eroded. If an investor wants exposure to insurance risk to diversify her portfolio, she has little option but to invest in the shares of an insurance group and be exposed to multiple insurance risks in addition to asset risks such as sovereign bonds.\u00a0\n\nIt is extremely difficult to match an investor\u2019s risk appetite with specific insurance risks such as personal or commercial, home, car, health or travel. Moreover, it is impossible for an investor to opt out of specific risk exposures. The only insurance risks investors can get direct exposure to are credit and catastrophe risk through the issue of catastrophe bonds.\u00a0\n\nThe peer-to-peer insurance model offers investors an opportunity to generate higher investment returns, transparency with regards to risk exposures and the satisfaction of directly insuring individuals or businesses rather than investing in a faceless insurance company. It offers policyholders access to cheaper premiums, faster claim payments and insurance coverage that might not be available through traditional channels.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto\u2019s primary achievement of preventing users spending the same bitcoin on multiple occasions (\"double spending\") without a reliance on a trusted third party is a historic feat. However, it is worth emphasizing the obvious that the protocol does not wholly eradicate reliance on trusted third parties for all financial contracts.\u00a0\n\nFor example, escrow mechanisms that are easily built using the Bitcoin protocol may still require dispute resolution if there is a disagreement over whether the goods or services delivered are of sufficient quality.\n\nNevertheless an escrow transaction built on a Bitcoin-like blockchain could be a template for how future insurance contracts are constructed. The insurance buyer and the insurance seller could transfer the premium and the collateral respectively into a multi-signature (2-of-3) Bitcoin wallet. The third signatory to the wallet would be the arbiter. Funds would be released from the wallet conditional on two parties signing the transaction, preventing the buyer, seller or arbiter from fraudulently seizing the funds.\n\nJust as the execution of a standard escrow contract will rely on an arbiter to resolve disputes between the buyer and the seller, the execution of an insurance contract relies on claims adjusters to verify that incoming claims are valid and if necessary estimate the monetary value of the claim.\u00a0\n\nThis service will vary from reviewing evidence submitted by the claimant to physically inspecting the scene of the insured event depending on the magnitude of the claim. It is currently difficult to automate this function, and artificial intelligence is not yet advanced enough to rebuff all human attempts of fraudulent submissions.\n\nDecentralized platforms heavily rely on the efficacy and dependability of reputation systems. The upside of bypassing centralized services such as eBay, Kickstarter or Uber is that no third party can charge excessive fees, impose restrictive policies, prohibit bitcoin payments or present a single point of failure in the storing of users\u2019 personal data.\u00a0\n\nHowever, the downside is that no organization is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the system. Instead a mixture of user feedback, reputation scoring and financial incentives must be combined to construct robust reputation systems. The alternative is to build quasi-decentralized systems that may be an improvement on centralized systems but don\u2019t accrue all the benefits of purely decentralized systems.\u00a0\n\nFor example, the various activities of an insurance company could be unbundled so that some activities are automated while others are outsourced to external providers.\u00a0 It may be the case that quasi-decentralized systems will need to be built as an intermediate step or that optimal systems will never be purely decentralized. However, it makes sense to fully explore all the options and capabilities of this technology before falling back on how current systems already operate.\n\nAlthough private blockchains (or \u2018permissioned distributed ledger systems\u2019) are useful for keeping databases in sync in a more trusted environment, they are an incremental innovation when compared to the potential of public blockchains. Just as Bitcoin opens the floodgates for peer-to-peer transactions and permissionless innovation, peer-to-peer insurance leveraging a smart contracts protocol could provide a platform for matching insurance buyers and insurance sellers for any risk they agree to exchange.\u00a0\n\nThis marketplace would be a radical paradigm shift from today\u2019s centralized and spatially anchored insurance industry. The blockchain provides the opportunity to build a more innovative, expansive and transparent industry that evolves to the needs and requirements of its users.\n\n\n\nPhoto Cheap Full Coverage Auto Insurance\u2122\n/ Flickr (CC)\n\n", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 30}

Every transaction and the full transaction history of any bitcoin address are permanently recorded in the tamper-proof public blockchain and open to analysis. A bitcoin addresses isn\u2019t explicitly associated to its owner, but blockchain network analysis can often de-anonymize bitcoin users.\nBitcoin Magazine\nrecently reported that two companies, Chainalysis\nand Elliptic\n, sell sophisticated blockchain network analysis tools and services to trace bitcoin transactions back to their participants, and de-anonymize users. Such services often anger libertarian early adopters, but the direction of the evolutionary trend in the Bitcoin space is clear \u2013 governments and financial institutions are gradually warming up to blockchain technology as a means to achieve faster, cheaper and better recorded transactions, but consider privacy and anonymity as bugs that need to be fixed.\nRecommended privacy practices, from simple measures such as using fresh Bitcoin addresses for new transactions to strong privacy measures such as dark wallets and mixing services, reduce the risk of being de-anonymized, but there are documented attack strategies\nthat often permit identifying bitcoin users by IP. Using the Tor network provides additional privacy protection by masking the user\u2019s IP, but ways to work around\nTor privacy have been found.\nNow two researchers from the ATR Defense Science & Technology Lab\nat Shenzhen University, in China, have published a white paper titled \u201cTransaction Remote Release (TRR): A New Anonymization Technology for Bitcoin\n.\u201d The researchers propose a new anonymization technology called Transaction Remote Release (TRR). Inspired by Tor, TRR is able to render several typical attack strategies ineffective. \u201cFurthermore, the performance of encryption and decryption of TRR is good and the growth rate of the cipher is very limited,\u201d say the researchers. \u201cHence, TRR is suited for practical applications.\u201d\n\u201cIn the Bitcoin protocol, the only way that the attackers can connect the Bitcoin address with an IP address is in the process of releasing and spreading a new transaction,\u201d note the researchers. Therefore, they propose to encrypt the new transaction and obfuscate the source IP of the sender.\nTRR is inspired by the idea of encryption and decryption layer by layer as used in Tor. A client encrypts a new transaction, layer by layer, using the public key from different TRR nodes. Then it establishes an independent connection to other TRR nodes, one by one, without using the spreading mechanism of the Bitcoin network.\nWhen a TRR node receives data, it will decrypt it using its private key. Then it transmits the remaining data to the next node. When the last TRR node is reached, it will release the transaction to the Bitcoin network. Every node knows its previous node and next node. Only the client and the last node know the content of the transaction but the last node does not know the IP address of the client.\nThe researchers analyze several possible de-anonymization attack strategies, including Bitcoin protocol sniffers, the Sybil attack, Sybil attack plus entry nodes, fake Bitcoin nodes and fake TRR nodes attack, and conclude that TRR can help clients gain strong anonymity.\n\"In addition,\u00a0 the experiments show that the performance of the TRR multi-layered encryption and decryption algorithm is satisfactory in practice and the growth rate of cipher text is very limited,\u201d note the researchers in the conclusion.\nThe researchers acknowledge that the current TRR proposal is vulnerable to DoS attacks based on fake TRR requests, and state that further research to eliminate this weakness is ongoing.\nBut another weakness is that implementing TRR would require changes to the Bitcoin protocol. That is a serious weakness, because it seems evident that, in the privacy-as-bug climate that is developing around Bitcoin, there is just no way modifications to Bitcoin Core explicitly aimed at anonymity could ever be accepted.\nTherefore, it might make more sense to consider implementing TRR in a privacy-enhanced sidechain. The modifications to Bitcoin Core required for implementing sidechains are justified by general considerations much more acceptable from a mainstream perspective. Sidechain Elements\n, the first experimental code base for sidechains released by Blockstream, includes confidential transactions, and a sidechain implementation of TRR could be a workable way to sneak privacy in.\nThe popular website Daily Dot\ncovered\nthe TRR white paper and noted that TRR first emerged\nin 2014 during the development of DarkNetCoin, a niche cryptocurrency focused on anonymity. Unfortunately the conclusion of the Daily Dot\narticle, \u201cBitcoin did not respond to a request for comment about TRR,\u201d reveals that the mainstream press still has basic things to learn about Bitcoin.", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 29}

Following its milestone, Vaultoro plans to expand its team and services internationally, to become the \u201ckey ingredient for the 2.6 billon under-banked\u201d individuals all around the globe.\n\nGold has been the international store of value for thousands of years. Unlike bitcoin or fiat money, gold has proved to be a stable universal currency with very low volatility. Based on the five-year gold chart taken from \nInfomine.com\n\n, the gold price in January 1, 2010 stood at around $1,100. At this time of writing, the price of gold is around $1,130, recording a mere $30 difference over the last five years.\n\n\n\nBrothers Joshua and Philip Scigala developed Vaultoro to allow the underbanked population to escape the volatility of bitcoin and store their wealth in physical gold.\n\n\u201cWe built Vaultoro so people anywhere in the world can hedge the bitcoin price volatility without going back to fiat but by instantly parking any value in gold. Gold gets its value from the markets and not by government dictate. It is also globally recognized as a store of value. It has lasted more than 3,000 years, whereas no paper fiat currency has lasted more than 200 without collapsing with terrible consequences for the holder,\u201d Joshua Scigala told \nBitcoin Magazine.\n \n\n\u201cWe see Vaultoro being a key ingredient for the 2.5 billion underbanked in the world to be able to accept payment from all around the world with bitcoin, hold that value in assigned gold and then spend it within seconds using bitcoin again,\u201d added Scigala. \u00a0\n\nCurrently, Vaultoro stores all of its physical gold in a Swiss high-security vault, 100 percent insured against theft, fire and other eventualities. Unlike most of fiat-to-gold bitcoin exchanges, Vaultoro will deliver gold bars in physical form to their users at any time.\n\nVaultoro to Launch a Point of Sales App\n\nOnline merchants, especially in Latin America and Southeast Asia have fallen victim to the highly volatile nature of bitcoin and time and time again. Today, there are very few platforms that enable users to hedge the value of bitcoin to another asset. \n\nWith an aim to serve small and medium-sized bitcoin merchants in underbanked regions, Vaultoro plans to launch a point of sales application that \u201cwill allow merchants to choose their hedge, meaning a 50/50 split or a 10/90 split between bitcoin they get in and gold they hold. We are looking at possible partnerships with ATMs and mobile payment providers in these regions so they can hook up to our system via API and use gold and bitcoin directly or indirectly through us,\u201d Scigala told \nBitcoin Magazine.\n\n\u201cLock-in Service\u201d\n\nA few bitcoin platforms such as Coinapult offer a bitcoin \u201clock-in\u201d service that allows users to lock in the price of bitcoin to the price of another asset has been popular in the United States and Latin America. The Vaultoro team found the idea of a gold-to-bitcoin lock-in service interesting, but they believe that the lock-in feature would contradict the fundamental philosophy that wealth is backed by real physical assets.\n\n\u201cWhen someone trades into gold on Vaultoro they actually buy physical gold that is secured as their property in their name. The gold is held in what\u2019s called a bailment contract meaning we secure someone else\u2019s property (just like self-storage facilities hold your furniture). By offering to lock in someone\u2019s bitcoin to a certain price we would be moving away from the fundamental philosophy that wealth is backed by real physical assets and not by a promise to lock a price and deliver on that,\u201d said Scigala.\n\nInstead, the Vaultoro team may look into diamonds or other physical assets that are even more stable than gold.\n\nInvestments\n\nCurrently, Vaultoro is considering a funding round to maintain its services and expand its team. The Vaultoro team is exploring a few options including crowdfunding campaigns and venture capital investments.\n\n\u201cAny other investment we would take on would not only be to raise money but also to gain expertise and knowledge by bringing onboard people that will help us grow our vision long term,\u201d Scigala said. \u201cA vision of open markets, a vision where we stop taking money from poor people in rich countries and giving it to rich people in poor countries, but rather give poor people in poor countries the tools to lift themselves out of poverty by enabling them to join a global market of goods and services through a bank and state independent monetary system we all know and love as Bitcoin.\u201d \n", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 29}

To the best of our knowledge all, or nearly all digital currency businesses have received letters from their bank, or in many cases banks, advising of the closure of their accounts. This includes at least 17, with 13 of these closed permanently,\u201d Tucker told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\n\nMajor Australian banks, including Westpac Banking Corporation and Commonwealth Bank of Australia, have not announced their motivations behind the termination of banking support for bitcoin companies. This incident has attracted the attention of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and Senator Matthew Canavan, who sees the sudden pronouncement of the bank as an unlawful act, and has requested the ACCC to launch a full investigation on the banks.\n\n\u201cWhilst we're unable to comment on the banks\u2019 motivations (that is for them to explain) however, the consequences of these moves are becoming more clear. The Australian Bitcoin industry, as part of a larger revolution in financial technology, has seen its growth severely curtailed by this unexplained wave of debanking,\u201d Tucker added.\n\nStartups Begin to Leave Australia\n\n\n\u201cUnfortunately most digital currency startups have already shut their doors in Australia as no alternative banking solutions were available. In at least one case, one Bitcoin company, Coinjar, did relocate its head office to a more welcoming market in the U.K.,\u201d Tucker told \nBitcoin Magazine.\n\nMost Australian Bitcoin startups offer bitcoin exchange services and merchant bitcoin payment processing; two of the few bitcoin-related services which require banking or credit card support. Although some bitcoin startups have begun to search for alternative financial institutions and organizations to maintain their operations, most companies have failed to secure banking service partnerships.\n\n\u201cPresently the industry here in Australia have no alternative options despite best efforts of our members to reach out to various banking sector participants,\u201d added Tucker. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nNo Clear Justification\n\n\nLabor Senator and a member of the Senate Economics References Committee Sam Dastyari showed his concerns toward the banks, due to their lack of explanation and justification behind the abrupt termination of banking support.\n\n\"I am concerned that there is an allegation that Australian banks are deliberately choking small businesses, while setting themselves up to offer the same services. We don't have a four-pillars policy to allow banks to guillotine emerging industries they are competing with \u2026 These small local digital currency companies are essentially competing to provide trading platforms, and develop emerging technologies,\u201d explained Dastyari\n\n.\n\nThe Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association strongly believes that the banks owe an explanation and a clear justification behind the \u201cdebanking\u201d of the companies. Currently, all Australian major banks have terminated banking support for Bitcoin companies.\n\n\u201cOur members have said the banks have been remarkably unwilling to provide explanations for ceasing to provide services for ADCCA members. Our members, some of whom may end up being partners with or competitors to the banks in the future, are currently at the mercy of established financial institutions. At the very least I think our members are owed an honest explanation of why they are being debanked,\u201d Tucker said.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 10, "day": 1}

The article, by Leah McGrath Goodman, served as the magazine\u2019s cover story on March 6, 2014. It claimed to have uncovered the true identity of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, following a two-month investigation that included \u201cinterviews with those closest to (Dorian) Nakamoto and the developers who worked most frequently with him (\u201cSatoshi\u201d).\n\nCiting Dorian\u2019s past contracting work on top-secret engineering projects, an ingrained disdain for government intrusion, and using quotes from various family members which paint him as a humble, privacy-obsessed engineering mastermind, Goodman made a compelling though surface-level argument for Dorian Nakamoto as the creator of Bitcoin.\u00a0\nBut following the article\u2019s publication, most involved with Bitcoin were quick to question the validity of Goodman\u2019s claims, seeing the evidence presented as largely circumstantial. A commonly held belief among those who are skeptical of Newsweek\n\u2019s claims is that \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto\u201d is actually an alias for a group\nof cryptographers/software engineers, rather than an individual. Others who corresponded with \u201cSatoshi,\u201d including core developer Gavin Andresen, believe he is in fact an individual.\nFurthermore, a recent piece by Nathaniel Popper in The\nNew York Times\nmakes the case that if the creator was indeed an individual, he was probably BitGold inventor and noted cryptocurrency expert Nick Szabo, not Dorian Nakamoto (although Szabo, too, refutes these claims).\u00a0\nStill others have asked the logical question of why a humble and essentially private person such as Dorian Nakamoto would create Bitcoin, seek anonymity for that feat, and then choose an alias that includes his given last name, in light of all of the other measures he took to remain anonymous.\nMike Hearn, a developer who communicated with Satoshi prior to his departure from Bitcoin, even posted a blog entry that charted logical inconsistencies within Goodman\u2019s claim that Dorian Nakamoto and Satoshi Nakamoto are one and the same.\u00a0\nTrial By Media Fire\n\nThe Newsweek\nstory revealed sensitive details about Dorian Nakamoto in an effort to highlight personality traits and motivations that fall in line with what little there is to infer about Bitcoin\u2019s creator. It ended up turning his world upside down.\nIn the midst of an unwanted media blitz that included what he describes as being unable to grab milk from the store without being barraged by reporters, Nakamoto gained support from lawyers and individuals in the Bitcoin community. One group even created the short-lived website \u201cnewsweeklied.com\u201d that was intended to clear his name and raise funds for a lawsuit against the publication giant.\u00a0\nIn a statement formally submitted to Newsweek\nby Nakamoto and his lawyer, he states that he \u201cdid not create, invent or otherwise work on Bitcoin,\u201d and that, \u201cNewsweek\n\u2019s false report has been the source of a great deal of confusion and stress for myself, my 93-year-old mother, my siblings, and their families.\u201d He then ends the letter: \u201cThis will be our last public statement on this matter. I ask that you now respect our privacy.\u201d\nGiven the definitive nature of that statement, I ask Dorian why he now desires to speak to the press. His simple answer: \u201cClosure.\u201d\u00a0\nCookies and Courtliness\n\nAs we enter Nakamoto\u2019s home, he leads me into the kitchen, where the table is neatly set with woven placemats, a Japanese style tea set and a box of chocolate chip cookies. It is immediately apparent that Nakamoto, 65, a bachelor with a past marriage and grown children on his family resume, may not regularly entertain new guests in such a quasi-formal setting, but he has his own sense of how to go about doing so. He exudes a kind of courtliness, reverence and respect for the occasion that young people today would likely describe as \u201cold-fashioned.\u201d\u00a0\nAs I take my seat, he is quick to offer and pour me green tea, then proceeds to make sure that I am content and comfortable in a way that feels refreshingly sincere. Not drinking any tea himself, he settles into his seat and begins to form circles around the empty cup with his fingers. Far from the shrewd, eccentric man portrayed in the Newsweek\npiece, he appears much more as a kind and good-humored person, with an almost canonical approach to respect and hospitality. After an exchange of additional basic pleasantries, he chuckles to himself and says in his slow, deep voice, \u201cOK. Ask me anything.\u201d\u00a0\nAt the crux of Newsweek\n\u2019s claim that Nakamoto is in fact the creator of Bitcoin is a brief exchange between Goodman and him, in which Goodman states that he \u201ctacitly\" acknowledged his role in the Bitcoin project by declaring to her: \u201cI am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it. It\u2019s been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.\u201d\nThe words \u201cno longer\n \ninvolved\u201d and \u201cturned over\u201d would seem to lend credence to the belief that Nakamoto was in fact involved in some capacity with the \u201cBitcoin project.\u201d I ask him about this exchange specifically, seeking to gain some clarity on his response. He replies: \u201cI was thinking about work I had done at Citibank that was security things, security exchange. Even if I was involved I can\u2019t tell you, because every engineering firm makes you sign a nondisclosure contract for during and post. I thought maybe that [her question] was something to do with Citibank work that I did.\u201d\n\nThis response provides potential clarity surrounding this pivotal exchange between Goodman and Nakamoto. He insists he was not even familiar with the term \u201cBitcoin\u201d at the time of the Newsweek \ninterview, and thought Goodman was referring to a project that he had worked on at Citibank. Why, at the time, he drew this conclusion about the connection between \u201cBitcoin\u201d and his previous, confidential work for Citi is still not entirely clear.\u00a0\nThe Case for and Against\n\nThe Newsweek \npiece emphasizes: \u201cPerhaps the most compelling parallel between the two Nakamotos are their professional skill sets and career timeframes.\u201d\u00a0\nWhile portrayals of work on classified military projects are commonly projected with an almost clich\u00e9d, sinister tone, Nakamoto\u2019s\u2019s reasons for the life of secrecy described by his family are far more practical than they are mysterious. In addition to the nondisclosure agreements he signs with each classified project, and his firm belief in abiding by what he describes as the \u201cengineer\u2019s code,\u201d he also emphasizes that it is extremely advantageous for people in his line of work to be as private as possible in order to best preserve their job security.\u00a0\nIn this and his other responses, it is clear that Nakamoto has the mind of an engineer, articulating each of his carefully constructed thoughts piece by piece, and attending to even the most seemingly minute details. Noting the measures that his employers take to ensure that contractors will not be motivated to exchange classified information for rewards, he explains how anything from debt to a troubled relative or an affair (remember David Petraeus\u2019s exit from the CIA?) would be grounds for immediate removal, and likely result in permanent exclusion from classified projects.\nHe notes that since publication of the Newsweek\narticle, which exposed many personal details including sensitive information about his health and finances, he has been effectively \u201cblacklisted\u201d from the types of engineering jobs that he has worked on throughout his professional career.\u00a0\nRespect for the \u201cBitcoin Creator\u201d\n\nWhile the unwanted association with Bitcoin has brought significant hardship and stress to Nakamoto\u2019s life, he brightens and is eager to thank the Bitcoin community for their \u201csupport.\u201d He then expresses appreciation toward the \u201ccreator\u201d for bringing Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain technology to the world.\u00a0\n\u201cThe more I study about it, I think it\u2019s a fantastic idea. I really appreciate what he [Satoshi Nakamoto] did, and all the people who contributed, including [Bitcoin core developer Gavin] Andresen and Andreas [M. Antonopoulos, Bitcoin entrepreneur and security expert].\u201d\nWarming to his topic, he continues: \u201cAnd then the free software, freeware--that is a brilliant\u00a0 idea on the part of this creator or group of creators. But you also need very talented people to implement and carry it out; also marketing, sales. I just feel when I looked at it, I said \u2018Wow! This is a beautiful thing.\u2019 Especially if you are anti-authority or anti-establishment, which would be banks and governments and things like that. And they [Bitcoin] have a hold of young people now, including Jeffrey right here!\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see how Bitcoin evolves into the next stage. How it encounters this problem, I won\u2019t say problem, but government is always trying to encroach. Same thing with banks. And we will have to withstand the storm of what\u2019s going to happen to our dollars as the international standard exchange currency\u2026.The biggest thing is we can\u2019t possibly pay,\u201d he says, in reference to the American debt. \u00a0 \u201cMy hope is that the top level designers, the creators, think about that.\u201d\u00a0\nI am astonished to hear that Nakamoto has such high praise for the technology, and moreover, that he has clearly thought about how it should evolve, drawing on the nuances of the economic implications surrounding a decentralized currency/monetary system, and in light of the current geopolitical environment.\nRiding Toward a Powerful Future\n\nNakamoto\u2019s car, a faded beige Toyota Corolla, which \u201cstill runs great\u201d after having logged almost 200,000 miles on the odometer, is not his preferred method of transportation. Driving to grab some Chinese food in Temple City, he points out the flawed street design and cracked sidewalks that obstruct his frequent bike rides around town.\nChuckling as he explains what he sees as simple solutions to basic infrastructure problems, he notes the pleasure and peace he finds in his regular bicycle rides, smiling as he recounts past excursions through the San Gabriel foothills and on the banks of the Los Angeles River. (Yes, there is such a thing, but it is mostly a wide concrete channel traversing the L.A. basin.)\nIn his New York Times\npiece, Popper states, \u201cAt this point, the creator\u2019s identity is no longer important to Bitcoin\u2019s future.\u201d While most Bitcoin observers would likely believe this to be true, it is also clear that the unique mindset, convictions and motivations that governed \u201cSatoshi\u2019s\u201d approach have had a meaningful, lasting effect on the enterprise, and they warrant examination. In this regard, Satoshi Nakamoto becomes more than the \"genius\u201d\u00a0(or geniuses) who created Bitcoin\u2014he also created Bitcoin, took no credit, and left the fortune amassed by his own creation completely untouched, all in order to best preserve the purity of a powerful idea. And that is a world-changing thing, quite likely unique in human history.\nIt is almost impossible for most of us to imagine a person or group who would have both the technical skill set to create Bitcoin and the ability to faithfully execute on such selfless principles. This draws us to figures like Nick Szabo and Dorian Nakamoto. Both men\u2019s personalities and beliefs align with the characteristics that make Satoshi Nakamoto such a uniquely compelling figure. While such investigations are, for these reasons, entertaining and thought-provoking, they do clearly affect\u2014in Dorian\u2019s case, severely\naffect\u2014the individuals under examination.\u00a0\nMoreover, such attempts to unveil the creator\u2019s identity go against (what appears to be) Satoshi\u2019s desire for Bitcoin to evolve as a truly inclusive open source project, in which the actual identity of its creator is ultimately unimportant.\nWith all that said, I am glad I was able to spend a day with Dorian Nakamoto in Temple City. I hope that this account will shed some light on Newsweek\n\u2019s so-called \u201cFather of Bitcoin,\u201d and perhaps help provide him with the closure that he seeks. If so, it couldn\u2019t happen to a humbler guy.\n***\nPostscript: After learning of Dorian\u2019s financial complications, his friend cryptograffiti created a piece of artwork that will be auctioned off with 100% of the proceeds going to Dorian.

From a functional standpoint, the cryptocurrency has challenged the most fundamental principles of the world\u2019s financial systems by providing a decentralized, secured and trusted model to process financial transactions. To enable its magic, Bitcoin relies on an architecture powered by a groundbreaking technology known as the blockchain.\u00a0\nWhile bitcoin has clearly become the most important implementation, it is just one of many practical applications that can be powered by the blockchain. From the conceptual standpoint, the blockchain provides a series of capabilities that can change some of the well-established architectures in the enterprise digital world.\u00a0\nHow can the blockchain redefine enterprise?\n\nThe decentralized, autonomous, trusted and secured capabilities of the blockchain can redefine the foundational patterns of enterprise applications. While the principles of the blockchain are well-understood patterns in enterprise solutions, until now we have lacked practical implementations that validate its functionality at an enterprise scale. The blockchain opens a new set of opportunities to enterprise scenarios that weren\u2019t possible before. However, in order for blockchain solutions to be embraced in enterprise, they will have to develop a series of key capabilities to get past traditional IT compliance and regulatory practices.\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s needed to adopt the blockchain in enterprise?\u00a0\n\nDespite its unique value, the process of adopting blockchain solutions in enterprise is far from trivial. Like many other technology trends, blockchain solutions will have to develop a series of enterprise-ready capabilities to be adopted in mainstream business scenarios. Those enterprise-ready capabilities are called to address many requirements in areas such as management, operational readiness, or compliance, which are essential to adopt solutions on different industries. The following list includes some of the key capabilities required to adopt the blockchain in mainstream enterprise scenarios.\n\nDevelopment Platform: \u00a0The blockchain is a very complex architecture modeled in terms of transactional exchanges. To mitigate that complexity, we need programming frameworks and languages that allow average developers to build general-purpose applications against the blockchain.\nMonitoring Tools: \u00a0To be adopted in enterprise settings, the blockchain community should produce solutions that can actively monitor the health of a blockchain network and recover from unexpected failures. These capabilities will allow organizations to monitor the runtime behavior of blockchain solutions.\u00a0\nPrivate Cloud Deployments: \u00a0Facilitating the deployment of the blockchain in private cloud topologies using mainstream enterprise infrastructures is a key element to facilitate the wide adoption of blockchain solutions in the enterprise. In that sense, the blockchain should work seamlessly with technologies such as Docker, VMWare vCloud, Open Stack among other mainstream enterprise infrastructure platforms.\u00a0\nStandards: \u00a0As organizations start adopting blockchain solutions, the need to have standards will become increasingly relevant. Standards will facilitate the interoperability between different blockchain platforms while also enabling important security and compliance requirements of enterprise solutions.\u00a0\nInteroperability with Well-Established Enterprise Platforms:\u00a0 Like any other enterprise software trend, blockchain solutions will be required to integrate with established enterprise platforms like databases, line of business systems, etc. Enabling that interoperability will be essential to power the adoption of blockchain solutions in the enterprise.\n\n10 Enterprise Scenarios that can be Redefined by the Blockchain \u00a0\n\nDecentralized IoT\n\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming one of the most important trends in modern enterprise software. While many IoT platforms are based on a centralized model in which a broker or hub control the interaction between devices, this model has proved to be impractical for many scenarios in which devices need to exchange data between themselves autonomously. That specific requirement has been the fundamental principle behind decentralized IoT platforms. Those decentralized models are fundamentally powered by a trusted ledger of exchanges between smart devices fundamental to power real-world IoT solutions.\u00a0\nThe blockchain provides foundational capabilities of decentralized IoT platforms such as secured and trusted data exchange as well as record-keeping. In this type of IoT architecture, the blockchain will serve as the general ledger, keeping a trusted record of all the messages exchanged between smart devices in an IoT topology.\u00a0\nKeyless Signature\n\n\nPublic Key Infrastructure (PKI) has been one of the fundamental technologies powering data signatures. PKI models rely on a central authority to stamp and validate signatures on a data payload. While PKI models have been incredibly successful, the dependency on a central authority presents serious limitations for large-scale scenarios and is also vulnerable to attacks involving quantum computation.\u00a0\nThe characteristics of the blockchain can help to overcome some of the limitations of PKI models with a keyless security infrastructure (KSI). A KSI model uses only hash-function cryptography, allowing verification to rely only on the security of hash functions and the availability of a public ledger commonly referred to as a blockchain.\nData Archiving\n\n\nArchiving historical data in a secure and trusted manner has been a permanent challenge of enterprise IT. Companies like EMC have become one of the most iconic enterprise software companies in history by providing robust storage and archiving solutions. More recently, cloud platform vendors such as Amazon have provided alternative data archiving solutions. However, in both cases, data archiving solutions rely on a centralized storage model, which has well-known limitations in enterprise scenarios in areas such as security and privacy.\u00a0\nDecentralized and autonomous data archives models, such as the ones provided by the blockchain, can be an interesting alternative to centralized data storage solutions. This model will eliminate the dependency on a centralized authority and will allow distributed and trusted storage across nodes in a blockchain network. More importantly, using the blockchain as a data archive will allow any nodes to validate the authenticity of the archived data without relying on central hub.\u00a0\nDecentralized B2B Auditing\n\n\nBusiness-to-business (B2B) exchange models are one of the foundations of modern commerce. In those scenarios, transaction tracking, auditing and reconciliation processes are essential capabilities of B2B processes.\u00a0 Traditional B2B platforms enable these capabilities by providing centralized transaction tracking models that will be used by the different B2B endpoints to log relevant events of a specific transaction. These centralized tracking models have proved to be impractical to address many of the typical challenges of B2B transaction tracking processes in areas such as auditing and reconciliation.\u00a0\nLeveraging the blockchain as a decentralized, secured and trusted transaction ledger could be a more effective model to address the challenges of B2B transaction tracking solutions. Using the blockchain, each party in a B2B process could autonomously track the events related to a B2B transaction without the need to rely on a centralized authority. Additionally, the security capabilities of the blockchain will facilitate the implementation of more sophisticated reconciliation and auditing processes.\u00a0\nLegal Proof of Existence or Proof of Possession\u00a0\n\n\nValidating the existence or the possession of signed documents is an incredibly relevant element of legal solutions. The challenge of traditional document validation models is that they relied on central authorities for storing and validating the documents, which presents some obvious security challenges, but also becomes more difficult as the documents become older.\u00a0\nThe blockchain provides an alternative model to proof-of-existence and possession of legal documents. By leveraging the blockchain, a user can simply store the signature and timestamp associated with a document in the blockchain and validate it at any point using the native blockchain mechanisms.\u00a0\nDistributed File Storage\n\n\nCloud file storage solutions such as Box, Dropbox or One Drive are becoming regular citizens of modern enterprise environments. Despite its popularity, cloud file storage solutions typically face challenges in areas such as security, compliance and privacy in order to be adopted in enterprise environments. Those concerns are all rooted behind the fact that enterprises need to trust a third-party cloud system with their confidential documents.\u00a0\nSecurity Trade Settlement\n\n\nCentral Security Depositaries (CSDs) have been an essential element of modern equity and bond trading. In the U.S. equity market, following frequent bottlenecks during the late 1960s in the settlement of securities trades, CSDs smoothed the post-trade process for transferring share ownership by eliminating the exchange of paper certificates and recording transactions in central, computerized book-entry systems. The international CSDs Euroclear and Cedel (now Clearstream) played a similar role in the Eurobond market from the 1970s onward.\u00a0\nThe centralized nature of CSDs is essential to successful bond and equity trades. However, the settlement process via CSDs is incredibly expensive and slow, averaging two or three days per trade settlement. \u00a0\nThe blockchain offers an interesting alternative to traditional CSDs as a decentralized ledger that can keep records of transactions without relying on a central authority. The query capabilities of the blockchain will allow the settlement of trades in minutes or even seconds and at a fraction of the cost of the current CSD solutions.\u00a0\nAnti-Counterfeiting\n\n\nCounterfeiting remains as one of the biggest challenges in modern commerce. Segments like luxury goods, pharmaceutical or electronics are constantly affected by counterfeiting. As a result, the demand for anti-counterfeiting remains one of the hottest topics in the digital commerce world. Unfortunately, most solutions in the market require a trust in the third-party authority, which introduces a logical friction between merchants and consumers.\u00a0\nThe decentralized and security capabilities of the blockchain can enable an interesting alternative to traditional anti-counterfeiting platforms. In that sense, we can envision a model in which brands, merchants and marketplaces are part of a blockchain network with nodes storing information to validate the authenticity of specific products. In this model, brands don\u2019t have to trust a central authority with their product authenticity information and can rely on the security and decentralized trust models of the blockchain.\u00a0\neGoverment\n\n\nGovernments all over the world are investing deep resources to digitize many of their existing processes. Many of these processes deal with sensitive information that require sophisticated levels of traceability, privacy and security. Inevitably, the digital collaboration process relies on trust on centralized authorities.\u00a0\nThe blockchain capabilities provide a robust option to enable the digital collaboration between government agencies and citizens. In this model, different government agencies can store records in blockchain nodes so that it can be accessed and verified by other government parties and citizens in a secure and trusted way.\u00a0\nP2P Commerce\n\n\nTraditional ecommerce business models are based on the presence of a centralized entity that control activities such as order processing, inventory management, catalog access, etc. In order to buy and sell goods, ecommerce marketplaces need access to sensitive user information such as credit card information, user profile data etc. This information often becomes the target of cybersecurity attacks and many other security and regulatory challenges.\u00a0\nThe architecture of the blockchain can enable the first effective peer-to-peer (P2P) ecommerce network in which buyers and sellers can interact directly without the need of a central authority. The absence of a central marketplace eliminates many of the restrictions of ecommerce models such as fees, regulated transactions, etc.\u00a0\nSummary\n\nThe blockchain represents one of the most important advancements in computer science of the last few years. The ability to enable decentralized, secure, trusted and highly scalable architectures opens the door to a new group of enterprise software solutions on a large number of industries. Blockchain-powered solutions have the opportunity to challenge some of the fundamental architecture principles of enterprise solutions in areas such as security, data storage, trust, etc. Similar to Bitcoin, we should expect to see spectacular platforms in the enterprise software space powered by the blockchain.\u00a0\n\n", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 30}

The WEF was a bit more cautious with its own prediction and put 2027 as year they would reach the \u201ctipping point.\u201d\u00a0\nThe WEF described the use of apps such as Smartcontracts.com, a website that allows people to issue\u00a0programmable contracts that pay out sums of bitcoin when certain factors (set by the creator of the contract) are reached and verified, without the involvement of any middleman, as a \u201cShift In Action\u201d in society. \u201cThese contracts are secured in the blockchain as \u201cself-executing contractual states,\u201d which eliminate the risk of relying on others to follow through on their commitments.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201c[By 2025] 58% of respondents expected this tipping point to have occurred. Bitcoin and digital currencies are based on the idea of a distributed trust mechanism called the 'blockchain,' a way of keeping track of trusted transactions in a distributed fashion. Currently, the total worth of bitcoin in the blockchain is around $20 billion, or about 0.025% of global GDP of around $80 trillion,\u201d read the report.\u00a0\nPositive impacts of bitcoin and blockchain technology reaching a critical tipping point listed by the WEF included: more direct financial transactions with less and less middleman; brand new assets that can be traded; better property records, and more financial inclusion in emerging markets; blockchain-based contacts and legal services used as unbreakable escrow or programmatically designed smart contracts; and increased transparency.\u00a0\nTechnological Shifts that Will Change the Future\n\nWorld Economic Forum\u2019s Global Agenda Council on the Future of Software and Society gathered to identify 21 changes in society caused by software that would shape the future. They then survey business and technological leaders about when the \u201ctipping point\u201d for these technologies would happen and what the possible positive and negative effects of them would be, and published the results in a report titled Deep Shift: Technology Tipping Points and Societal Impact\n.\u00a0\nThe committee featured 18 thought leaders and executives in the technology industry, which included several familiar, or involved, in the bitcoin/blockchain industry. Ron Cao, managing director of Lightspeed Venture Partners, a venture firm that invested in American bitcoin exchange CirclePay and Chinese exchange BTCC (formly BTC China); Primavera De Filippi, research fellow at\u00a0Berkman Center for Internet & Society, France, and early explorer of bitcoin\u2019s and blockchain\u2019s effect on modern law, among others.\u00a0\nThe report also included the \u201csharing economy,\u201d 3D printing, smart cities, wearable devices, the Internet of Things (IoT), among the list of future-shaping technologies.\u00a0\n\u201cNow comes the second machine age. Computers and other digital advances are doing for mental power \u2013 the ability to use our brains to understand and shape our environments \u2013 what the steam engine and its descendants did for muscle power,\u201d wrote Council Vice-Chair and Director at MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy at Massachusetts Institute of Technology Erik Brynjolfsson in the report.\u00a0\nBlockchain use by governments was another trend that was included in the list. Possible uses by governments included recording land registries, tax collecting schemes, and other improvements in governmental processes. The tipping point decided by the WEF was the first time that tax is collected through a blockchain application and expected it to happen by 2023. \u00a0\n\u201c[By 2025] 73% of respondents expected this tipping point to have occurred. The blockchain creates both opportunities and challenges for countries. On the one hand, it is unregulated and not overseen by any central bank, meaning less control over monetary policy. On the other hand, it creates the ability for new taxing mechanisms to be built into the blockchain itself (e.g. a small transaction tax).\u201d\nThe WEF remained neutral on whether this would be a net positive or negative, citing corruption, real-time taxation, and unclear role for government in the process, including a state\u2019s central bank, were reasons it could \u201ccut both ways.\u201d\nAn example given by the report as already underway was a 2016 mayoral candidate of London who has suggested implementing blockchain technology to upgrade the city\u2019s\u2019 ledger for land, as well as for its finances and budget. (Similar experiments are going on in Honduras and the Isle of Man.) \u201cBecause these records are kept permanently, there is a strong possibility (without the blockchain) for them to be altered or faulted.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThe Internet is driving a shift towards networks and platform-based social and economic models. Assets can be shared, creating not just new efficiencies but also whole new business models and opportunities for social self-organization. The blockchain, an emerging technology, replaces the need for third-party institutions to provide trust for financial, contract and voting activities,\u201d concluded the report.\u00a0\n\n\n\nPhoto World Economic Forum\n", "year": 2015, "month": 10, "day": 2}

A presentation given over the summer reveals a new focus on Storj and Filecoin. \u00a0\n\nMembers of the\u00a0Dutch\u00a0National Police and UNIJURIS gave a presentation in July titled \u201cTechnical and Legal Challenges of Criminal Law Enforcement in the Digital Age\n.\u201d This is an update of a presentation given in 2013 titled \u201cThe merits & challenges of distributed least authority data storage\n.\u201d\nThe presentations explain how cloud storage and file hosting \"Data is cut up in a hundred pieces. Pieces are spread over a hundred servers, in dozens of countries, over a multitude of hosters.\u201d\nBoth presentations explain how Mega (Mega Limited) replaced the controversial Megaupload cloud storage service. Megaupload was seized and shut down by the United States Department of Justice in January 2012\nover copyright infringement claims.\nExtradition hearings are currently underway\nfor Megaupload founder Kim DotCom in New Zealand.\u00a0 When the original Megaupload site was seized, federal prosecutors stated, \u201cThis action is among the largest criminal copyright cases ever brought by the United States and directly targets the misuse of a public content storage and distribution site to commit and facilitate intellectual property crime.\u201d\u00a0 However, Kim DotCom, founder of Megaupload and Mega, recently distanced himself from Mega, stating over the summer\nthat he would not trust Mega with user data and that he intends to create a third version of the site.\n\n\nHow would you like a new Internet that can't be controlled, censored or destroyed by Governments or Corporations? I'm working on it #MegaNet\u2014 Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) February 16, 2015\n\nAs the Dutch presentation explains, next-generation technologies such as Mega make it more difficult for law enforcement to seize:\u00a0\u201cNever mind reading it. Data cannot even be located without the key.\u201d\n\nThe presentation from this year was updated to include both Filecoin\nand Storj\n(pronounced \u201cstorage.\u201d).Filecoin, according to its website, is a \u201cdata storage network and electronic currency based on Bitcoin. Users can \u201cEarn Filecoin by renting disk space.\u201d\u00a0\nFilecoin was named by both \nBusiness Insider\n and \nCoindesk\n as Bitcoin projects to watch in 2015.\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nStorj, according to its website, is \u201cbased on blockchain technology and peer-to-peer protocols to provide the most secure, private, and encrypted cloud storage.\u201d It will allow users to rent out extra hard-drive space and bandwidth using MetaDisk\n. It is built on top of Bitcoin with the Storjcoin X \u201cSJCX\u201d Counterparty\ntoken.\u00a0 According to CoinMarketCap\n, SJCX has a market capitalization of approximately $735,000 at time of publication.\nBitcoin Magazine\n spoke with Storj founder Shawn Wilkinson, who said that the presentation did a good job on half the picture:\n\n\u201cTraditionally, law enforcement could knock on the door of a third-party provider for access to information. As this is abused and data becomes more and more abstract and distributed (for economic and reliability) this will become almost impossible. This should lead to a decrease in cybercrimes as well. If governments can't get access to it, neither can attackers.\u201d\nFurther, he noted that it missed some of the benefits to law enforcement:\n\u201c[It] Misses the possible use cases with this type of system in law enforcement. For example, handling of digital evidence in a public and verifiable way.\u00a0 \u201c[This was] Not possible before.\u201d\nFor example, in a popular dashcam video\nof a phone theft on Youtube, the detective assigned to the case was eventually provided with a signed (with an indelible ink pen) DVD by the person who captured the video. This seems like an antiquated way to prove authorship.\nThe presentation offered the following \u201csolutions\u201d:\nRegarding Jurisdiction:\u00a0\u201cLegal duty (based on a warrant, of course) for third parties (companies) to hand over data\u00a0\nlocally in countries they offer their services in.\u201d\n\nRegarding Enforcement:\u00a0\u201cSeizure and acquisition moves back to the [end user or] client (not the hoster [or company].) [This creates a] New legal paradigm regarding the \u2018location\u2019 of data.\u201d\n\nWilkinson said that the \u201cP\nossible solutions portion won't work at all as these solutions become more and more distributed.\u201d While he disagrees with solutions, he thought the presentation was very forward-thinking and they are \u201casking the right questions.\u201d\nThe distributed platform such as that which Storj will provide is a paradigm shift away from traditional centralized services.\u00a0 The past year saw very high-profile hacks of SONY\n, the Office of Personnel Management\nand even Ashley Madison\n. The breadth and scale of these kinds of data breaches are made possible though centrally stored data.

The service has been used by Filipino expats working in countries including Canada, UAE, Singapore, Hong Kong, Austrailia and Canada.\n\n\u201cUsing Bitcoin, we've made it easier for Rebit users to send targeted remittances. A good number of remittances coming from overseas Filipino workers are intended for bills payments anyway. By enabling our users with this service, we've made it more convenient by eliminating that second step for them,\u201d Rebit.ph CEO John Bailon told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\n\nAn official with Satoshi Citadel, the parent company and investor of Rebit.ph told Bitcoin Magazine\nthat the Philippines-to-Canada, -Hong Kong and -Singapore remittance markets are huge, and that there are hundreds of thousands of Filipino employees working in these countries to support their families in their homeland.\n\nQuite often, these expat workers pay utility bills such as water and electricity and credit card bills directly from these countries, using the Rebit.ph platform or the Coins.ph platform, which is currently ranked among the top 300 most popular websites in the Philippines.\n\nCoins.ph, a competitor of Rebit.ph has seen a huge success through its partnerships with local banks, remittance outlets and financial institutions. The platform enables users to pay utility bills and cash out bitcoin at any of its supported outlets, including thousands of ATMs from the nationwide Security Bank and remittance outlets from Lhuiller and Palawan Pawn Shop.\n\nHowever, Bailon told Bitcoin Magazine\n \n\nthat its platform is different from services such as Coins.ph, because of its over-the-counter transactions for remittances and bills payments.\n\n\u201cCoins.ph allows people to load funds into and draw from their mobile money wallet, while Rebit is closer to the current user experience of an electronic over-the-counter transactions for remittances and bills payments,\u201d Bailon explained.\n\nCurrently, many local residents and employees prefer to pay bills at local establishments and institutions. However, the Rebit.ph team says that the local residents are starting to recognize the advantages of bitcoin and bitcoin bills payment systems.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be a paradigm shift in consumer behavior when it comes to electronic bills payments. Most Filipinos still pay their bills in-person at establishments even though they actually have access to more convenient methods. We're getting there, and when more and more people start to realize the convenience of electronic bills payments, Rebit is here to allow them to do it over the blockchain,\u201d said Bailon.\n\nLiving Room of Satoshi\n\n\nLiving Room of Satoshi, Australia-based bills payment platform allows anyone to pay any Australian bill using bitcoin. The platform has been providing bitcoin bills payment service in all sectors, including shopping, entertainment, banking, Internet, electricity/gas, rent, tax, insurance and water.\n\n\n\n\nThe platform has been welcomed and used by Australian residents across the country. In a recent interview with Bitcoin Magazine,\n \n\nAustralian farm Buda Foods founder and CEO Mark Burgunder said:\n\n\u201cWe currently have a great service available here called Living Room of Satoshi that allows us to make bill payments and electronic transfers to almost any bank account in Australia using bitcoins. We've been using this service on a number of occasions already with the largest purchases so far having been for chicken feed and for mobile electric fencing.\u201d\n\n\nMany bitcoin enthusiasts and startups in the Philippines and Australia believe that the key to mainstream success for bitcoin is to educate the general population about its advantages, and encourage people to use bitcoin for day-to-day expenses.\u00a0\n\n\n\nPhoto\u00a0\nwww.tOrange.us\n\n", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 30}

The wait is over.\n\nCustomers have been begun receiving instructions for onboarding and will be able to officially begin trading on the Gemini exchange starting Thursday, October 8 at 9:30 a.m. EST.\n\nThe nine months it took for Gemini to go from announcement to launch is due to a belief in the need to \u201cask for permission, not forgiveness.\u201d However, on September 23, Gemini Trust Company received approval for its Articles of Organization and was further granted an exemption from the deposit insurance requirements of Section 32 of the Banking Law. Law firm Kaye Scholer\u2019s Corporate partner, Evan Greebel, advised Gemini throughout its formation and launch.\nDue to its corporate structure as a limited liability trust company (LLTC), it is able to service both individual and institutional customers, which is important because many believe that banks are curious about trading bitcoin.\n\u201cThe reality is that institutions will bring the most amount of capital to the exchange,\u201d Cameron Winklevoss, president of Gemini Trust Company, told Bitcoin Magazine in an interview and demo. \u201cEvery major bank in the world has people looking at bitcoin.\u201d\nThe downside of being an LLTC is that the company itself cannot provide FDIC insurance for its accounts. That being said, Gemini revealed at launch that a New York based bank is the depository institution for all US dollars transferred to Gemini. Through this partner, all USD is eligible for FDIC insurance.\n\nFour Silos of Success\nIn an interview with Cameron Winklevoss, he revealed that the company operates on four silos that they drive toward for success.\n\nThe fastest way for a user to lose trust in a company is for security to be insufficient. Because of that, security is the company\u2019s primary objective. They hired Cem Paya, the former security lead at AirBnB, to be the chief security officer at Gemini. Further, all bitcoin is held by Gemini in a cold, geographically dispersed network of servers. When the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF, COIN, launches, all of its bitcoin will be held by Gemini.\nTaking it a step further, though, the company has put in place a rule that prohibits any links in emails. For example, in its \u201cGemini is open for business!\u201d launch email, there is no link to Gemini. To prevent phishing attempts whereby a hacker gains access to a user\u2019s account, the individual has to manually type in Gemini.com to register.\nFollowing security came compliance. Since the company is based in New York, that meant working with the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYFDS). According to Winklevoss, NYDFS seemed open to working with Gemini. Compliance was also required for the remainder of the country.\n\nAt launch, users in California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota,Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont,Washington, D.C., and Wyoming can use Gemini starting on Thursday.\n\nThe third component of the Winklevoss\u2019 four silos is banking. There have been too many instances where a bank won\u2019t cover a bitcoin company because of the concern about auditing. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take a lot of selling to convince the bank to work with us,\u201d Winklevoss said. \u201cThey liked the team and the product.\u201d\n\nOnly after security, compliance and banking were handled did the product become a priority. And if any of the four silos had to suffer, it would be product.\n\u201cYou have to have all four right to succeed, but if you\u2019re missing a little bit on product, it\u2019s not going to be catastrophic,\u201d he explained. \u201cRather than building a rocket shop in the air, we built it in the hanger, tested it, and tested it again, and then we have liftoff.\u201d\nIn his interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Winklevoss talked at length about the risk tolerance of banks and the simple fact that they hate risk.\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to have the regulatory framework figured out because the risk appetite of banks is conservative. People don\u2019t recognize how important regulation is these institutions. Banks care,\u201d he explained.\n\nAnd because it is the big institutions that are bringing the majority of the capital, it was important to the team to have that regulatory framework squared away. \u201cThere is a lot of dark pool trading, because it is easier, that will go on exchange when they are regulated.\u201d\n\nGemini wasn\u2019t the first to market, but Winklevoss said that wasn\u2019t important to him.\n\n\u201cMarket centers [like Gemini] will build up reputation and credibility with participants over time. A month does not make or break your business,\u201d he explained, referring to other exchanges that had already launched in New York City.\n\n\nTrading on the Exchange\nThe exchange opens for trading on Thursday 9:30 a.m. EST, but users can begin the process of signing up today.\nPart of the registration process is a knowledge-based authorization. The system will attempt to verify a user\u2019s identity through a Social Security number and then questions about that user\u2019s credit. For example, it will ask if they have ever owned a house on a particular street if that appears on the credit report. This is meant to speed up the authorization process for that user.\n\nIn our demo, Winklevoss stressed the importance that he wanted Gemini to become the favorite of both institutions and individuals.\n\u201cEarly community is certainly very important because they are the most vocal and they are the ones who will touch the product more,\u201d he explained.\n\n\nThe team went with a very clean look, using as much white space as possible. Further, the system was built with visualization engines that enable the user to identify what impact their particular trade will have on the order book.\n\n\nFor example, in the image above, if a user decided topurchase 0.631 BTC at a limit of $237.71, the blue portion of the order book would fill in darker where that purchase takes place. This is meant to show what the average price would be for the user.\n\n\nAt launch, it will be free to deposit and withdraw fundsfrom Gemini. However, the company will charge a 25 basis points fee for both buyers and sellers who trade on the exchange. There will also be APIs for individuals who are more interested in programmatically trading to participate.\n\nPhoto\u00a0TechCrunch\n\u00a0/\u00a0Flickr\n\n", "year": 2015, "month": 10, "day": 5}

DigiCash, which pioneered anonymous digital transactions and is often considered a conceptual precursor of Bitcoin, declared bankruptcy in 1998. Negroponte was an investor and the first chairman.\n\u201cChaum\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre was electronic privacy, and his plans for DigiCash were ambitious,\u201d noted a\u00a0Forbes\u00a0article titled \u201cRequiem for a Bright Idea\u201d published after the DigiCash went out of business. \u201cDigital pseudonyms would protect the identity of Netizens as they roamed the Web. Chaum became a hero to cyberlibertarians.\u201d\nDespite his past involvement with DigiCash and the idea of electronic transactions, Negroponte definitely doesn\u2019t come across as a cyberlibertarian. On the contrary, he self-identifies as a socialist. \u201cIf it\u2019s not clear, I am about as socialist as you can get,\u201d says Negroponte at the beginning of the Q&A session after the talk. \u201cI come from an era and a part of the world where socialism was viewed as good.\u201d\nNegroponte opened his talk with three anecdotes: the spontaneous use of sky lift e-tickets as a parallel currency by the people of a Swiss sky resort; his experience as target of cybercrime by hackers who impersonated him via email and stole a lot of money from his bank account, which he couldn\u2019t recover even after the intervention of his brother\u00a0John Negroponte, former U.S. Deputy Secretary of State; and his recent experiences in Greece when\u00a0the banks were closed\u00a0as a consequence of the Greek crisis.\nNegroponte is firmly persuaded of the importance of Bitcoin.\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of too many things that are more important than Bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t blow it. Don\u2019t screw it up.\u201d\nMany people in the audience applauded at this point, including libertarians and crypto-anarchists, but these didn\u2019t applaud much after Negroponte started to explain his thoughts on how to ensure a bright future for Bitcoin \u2013 with a socialist slant.\nThe worst thing entrepreneurs can do, according to Negroponte, is to consider Bitcoin as a get-rich-quick scheme, because treating Bitcon as such creates large price fluctuations and episodes that scare people away from Bitcoin. On the contrary, Bitcoin should be approached with a sense of mission \u2013 a mission to make the world a better place, he said.\u00a0\u00a0Negroponte urged the entrepreneurs in the audience to do non-profits.\nSimilar considerations apply beyond Bitcoin. Negroponte, who has been involved in about 60 startups himself, is critical of the startup culture. Today\u2019s startups, according to Negroponte, cause enormous brain drain.\n\u201cSome of the smartest kids are being sucked out of society to do the stupid apps on some iPads with their girlfriends and boyfriends,\u201d he said (another applause here), instead of working on big, hard problems. Here, Negroponte seems to agree with hardcore libertarian venture capitalist\u00a0Peter Thiel, who, in\u00a0an interviewpublished on\u00a0MIT Technology Review, exhorted entrepreneurs to go after bigger problems than the ones Silicon Valley is chasing.\n\u201cWe wanted flying cars; instead we got 140 characters,\u201d Thiel said.\nThough the role of entrepreneurs and philanthropists in technology development is often emphasized, Negroponte thinks civil servants also have an important role to play. He considers roads, public transportation, education and the Internet itself as important parts of the infrastructure of a civil society, which should be developed by the government and made available to everyone at no cost.\nCurrency \u2013 including emerging digital currencies like Bitcoin \u2013 should also be part of the essential infrastructure provided by the government, he said. Bitcoin is important from a global point of view, said Negroponte, and could help creating much-needed global governance structures in an increasingly fragmented world.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong in being run by the government?\u201d asked Negroponte, \u201cIf you think the government can\u2019t run anything, go to Switzerland and ride a train.\u201d He added that Finland has the world\u2019s best education system, and no private schools. While acknowledging that there are lessons to be learned from libertarians, Negroponte sees an important role for the government to collect taxes and distribute benefits to everyone.\nNegroponte\u2019s talk, which is likely to provoke heated debates, can be interpreted as self-serving. In fact, the\u00a0Digital Currency Initiative\u00a0at MIT Media Lab, founded by Negroponte, is claiming a role of arbitration and\u00a0leadership\u00a0in Bitcoin developments, in prestigious academic settings far from get-rich-quick schemes, and Negroponte hinted at the Media Lab\u2019s role at several points in the talk.\n\nPhoto\u00a0Gin Kai /\u00a0Wikimedia (CC)", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 15}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nAt the crux of the\u00a0block-size limit debate\u00a0in Bitcoin is an argument between scaling and securing the network. Although raising the block-size limit would allow more transactions to be processed in each block, it could also limit the ability for individuals in some parts of the world to run a full node or participate in the mining process. This problem would arise due to the increased costs of processing a greater number of transactions every 10 minutes as a\u00a0full node.\nBlockstream\u00a0co-founder and President\u00a0Adam Back\u00a0recently discussed the security vs. scalability debate on an episode of\u00a0Epicenter Bitcoin, noting that increased centralization due to a raised block-size limit could be even more problematic when factoring in all of the other forms of centralization that already exist in the digital cash system:\n\n\u201cOne of the challenges we\u2019re facing right now with the block size is that decentralization is already under stress. There\u2019s a certain amount of centralization that\u2019s crept in \u2014 sort of\u00a0boiling the frog.\u201d\n\nBack, who created\u00a0Hashcash\u00a0(the\u00a0proof-of-work\u00a0system used by Bitcoin), then pointed to three specific areas of Bitcoin that already are experiencing problems related to centralization.\nMining Pools\nThe problems associated with the centralization of Bitcoin\u00a0mining pools\u00a0are generally known by the overall Bitcoin community. Whenever a mining pool gets close to 51 percent of the overall network hashrate, there are usually more than a few panic-induced posts on various Bitcoin forums warning of a possible\u00a051 percent attack.\nWhen it comes to the fundamental problems associated with large mining pools owning a majority of the\u00a0network hashrate, Back seems concerned about the ability of those pools to introduce restrictions on certain types of transactions on the Bitcoin network. He stated the following during his interview:\n\n\u201cThere are a number of quite high percentage hashrate pools and vertically integrated miners such that, arguably, it would only take a policy decision by maybe three to six of them to fairly, practically implement a policy.\u201d\n\nBack also was quick to note that such a policy implementation would not be completely successful due to the reality that the nefarious mining pools would not be mining every single block on the blockchain:\n\n\u201cPart of the way that Bitcoin achieves policy neutrality is that there are different people who process the transactions, so potentially even if 75 percent of the hashrate wanted to freeze or block a Bitcoin payment \u2014 let\u2019s say Wikileaks had received a payment and someone wanted to stop them spending it \u2014 still, the remaining 25 percent would eventually process the transaction. So, it would just be delayed, not blocked. Nevertheless, there is a degree of centralization there.\u201d\n\nASIC Mining Hardware Manufacturers\nAnother problem Back sees for Bitcoin in terms of centralization has to do with the companies building the hardware that people use for bitcoin mining:\n\n\u201cAnother kind of metric is the number of\u00a0ASIC\u00a0manufacturers that are selling direct to the public or to small businesses or people that would buy $10,000 or $100,000 worth of mining equipment and put it in a small warehouse or garage or something. The number of independent ASIC manufacturers is, I think, decreasing. There are still a couple that will sell to the public, but there are also more that have turned their attention to vertical integration or have merged or been bought and a few that have gone bankrupt through poor timing in the market.\u201d\n\nOne of the key issues here is that the most efficient mining equipment is becoming centralized in fewer and fewer hands. The fear is that it is becoming much more difficult for the average person to get involved in securing the Bitcoin network through mining \u2014 even if they\u2019re willing to put up the relatively large amount of capital needed to build a mining facility. This could eventually lead to issues similar to the policy-related problems covered by Back when referring to mining pools.\nLack of Full Nodes\nThe third type of centralization that Back sees in Bitcoin is the dwindling number of full nodes. A full node is a node that enforces all rules of the Bitcoin protocol and contains a full copy of the blockchain. Back explained that these nodes are helpful in keeping miners honest:\n\n\u201cAnother very interesting one that people are, I think, largely not aware of \u2014 which is behind some differences in opinion, I think, at the protocol level \u2014 is this concept of running a full node (sort of an auditing node). The percentage of economic interest in the network that is validating transactions that it receives via its own full node \u2014 I think we\u2019re seeing evidence that that is falling as well. That is an interesting and necessary part of the Bitcoin security picture \u2014 that the proportion of economic interest in the network that is relying on a full node that is under its control or is trusted by it should be relatively high. If it falls too low, there is no longer a security assurance for users because the miners are providing a service to users \u2014 particularly for\u00a0SPV\u00a0users. If there are no auditors, there\u2019s no kind of checkpoint; there\u2019s only miners balanced against other miners.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to define Bitcoin at the start of the\u00a0Epicenter Bitcoin\u00a0interview, Back was sure to make the point that decentralization is the core value proposition of the peer-to-peer cash system. Censorship resistance is what separates Bitcoin from other online payment systems, such as\u00a0e-gold\u00a0and\u00a0PayPal, so it\u2019s easy to see why Back believes the preservation of decentralization is of the utmost importance.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 12}

The funds are expected to go to a forthcoming Series A capital raising for R3.\nThe project will be led by R3 Founder and Managing Partner David Rutter, who served as CEO of electronic broking at ICAP, the world\u2019s largest interdealer broker, from 2010 to 2013. Prior to ICAP, Rutter was co-owner of Prebon Yamane, last serving as chief executive officer for the Americas.\nThe R3 team is composed of a highly specialized team of financial services industry veterans, technologists, subject matter experts and new tech entrepreneurs especially focused on rethinking and improving the modern financial markets ecosystem. Rutter recruited another former ICAP trading executive, Nichola Hunter, to join R3. Richard Brown, a technology expert formerly with IBM UK, and Tim Swanson, a U.S.-based cryptocurrencies consultant, have also joined R3.\nIn addition to developing commercial applications, the project will seek to establish consistent standards and protocols for this emerging technology across the financial industry in order to facilitate broader adoption and gain a network effect, notes an\u00a0R3 press release. The group will collaborate on research, experimentation, design, and engineering to help advance state-of-the-art enterprise-scale shared ledger solutions to meet banking requirements for security, reliability, performance, scalability and audit.\nR3 and its bank partners will establish collaborative joint working groups to lead these efforts, which will leverage the R3 team as well as experts within the partner banks. The group will work within a collaborative lab environment or \u201csandbox\u201d to test and validate distributed ledger prototypes and protocols.\n\u201cThis partnership signals a significant commitment by the banks to collaboratively evaluate and apply this emerging technology to the global financial system,\u201d said Rutter. \u201cOur bank partners recognize the promise of distributed ledger technologies and their potential to transform financial market technology platforms where standards must be secure, scalable and adaptable.\u201d\nR3 is an innovation firm focused on building and empowering the next generation of global financial services technology, states the company\u2019s website.

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nThe idea of a\u00a0benevolent dictator\u00a0for Bitcoin has become a topic of conversation throughout the community lately due to\u00a0Mike Hearn\u2019s role as the final authority for changes in\u00a0Bitcoin XT. Although it should be made clear that Hearn is able to dictate only policy for that particular implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, some individuals are turned off by the idea of having a single point of failure in the development process.\nBlockstream\u00a0co-founder and President\u00a0Adam Back\u00a0is one such person, and he shared some of his views on the subject during a recent interview with\u00a0Epicenter Bitcoin.\nPutting the Entire Bitcoin Economy on One Man\u2019s Shoulders\nBack described a variety of issues with a benevolent dictatorship governance model for Bitcoin during the interview, but his main point was that having a single person with a large amount of power in the development process could lead to problems associated with moral hazard.\nThere\u2019s also the issue of the immense amount of pressure facing any individual who decides to take on the role of benevolent dictator. Back described this dynamic during his appearance on\u00a0Epicenter Bitcoin:\n\n\u201cI think the danger with Bitcoin is that there\u2019s a lot of other people\u2019s money at stake, right? There\u2019s a $4 billion economy, and as we go into the future \u2014 if Bitcoin sees adoption in certain segments for international settlements or as acompetitor to gold\u00a0or something \u2014 that could turn into a $4 trillion economy. If you turn around and think for a few minutes about would you personally like to be the final arbiter, I think you\u2019ll find the answer would be no because you would be subject to immense amounts of international pressure, potentially blackmail, people bugging your equipment, [people] trying to sabotage [you.] Even governments and central banks employing Nobel Laureate economists struggle to avoid moral hazard.\u201d\n\nPromoting a Diverse Development Process\nBack then discussed some of the other risks associated with having a single person making final decisions on important development matters in Bitcoin. He noted the importance of having a diverse development process to avoid those kinds of issues:\n\n\u201cAnother kind of risk is that a particular individual may have a hidden agenda or be working for, you know, a criminal organization or a foreign government with a conflict of interest or something. If there\u2019s a peer-review process where a group of diverse people have to review changes and approve [them] \u2014 that\u2019s the best we know how to do in terms of avoiding those kinds of influences creeping in.\u201d\n\nAlthough many people have demonized the relatively slow development process that has plagued\u00a0Bitcoin Core\u00a0for the past few years, the reality is that there may not be better options that don\u2019t introduce new, unforeseen complications.\nGavin Andresen on Being the Benevolent Dictator of Bitcoin\nBitcoin XT Developer and\u00a0Bitcoin Foundation\u00a0Chief Scientist\u00a0Gavin Andresen\u00a0was interviewed in an episode of\u00a0Epicenter Bitcoin\u00a0released one week prior to Adam Back\u2019s appearance, and he also shared his thoughts on the pressure related to being a benevolent dictator for Bitcoin:\n\n\u201cHaving been in the position of lead maintainer and knowing that this whole multi-billion dollar industry kinda-sorta rests on your shoulders because you\u2019re in charge of the code that everybody is running \u2014 that\u2019s a horrible place to be. It\u2019s insane pressure to make the right decision, which is part of the reason why I think we need to evolve beyond that \u2014 so that no one person or group of people feels like the whole weight of the system rests of their decisions, so there is more room to make decisions, to innovate and even make mistakes.\u201d\n\nAndresen\u2019s\u00a0view\u00a0is that a benevolent dictator could allow the development community to avoid delays in the deployment of bug fixes and new features, although he\u2019d also like to see a variety of implementations of the Bitcoin protocol:\n\n\u201cThe impact of those mistakes will be smaller if you have a more diverse system where maybe not everybody is running the same version of the code on the network. There are lots of different versions of the code if any one breaks; it\u2019s not that big of a deal because the whole system doesn\u2019t break. Diversity really does bring more robustness in this case.\u201d\n\nFor now, Bitcoin Core is still the main implementation of the protocol used by the vast majority of users.\u00a0Wladimir J. van der Laan\u00a0is technically the lead maintainer of Bitcoin Core, but he is not willing to act as benevolent dictator at this time. Unless the mining industry changes their minds and begins to support Bitcoin XT, it appears that there won\u2019t be any benevolent dictators of Bitcoin in the near future.\n\u00a0\nPhoto\u00a0World Economic Forum\u00a0/\u00a0Flickr (CC)", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 14}

The remittance services and outlets such as Western Union and Lhuiller (Filipino Local Remittance Service) can be extremely expensive and inefficient, as it requires 5 percent to 12 percent of the entire transaction to be paid as \u201cservice fees.\u201d\nSatoshi Citadel Industries and its subsidiary company Rebit.ph aims to break this barrier of the Filipino and Canadian remittance markets to enable Filipino expat workers to send and transfer payments with ease. The company is seeking to get a significant share of the Philippines-to-Canada remittance market and process as many remittance payments as possible using Bitcoin technology.\nSpeaking to\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine, Satoshi Citadel Industries CEO John Bailon explained:\n\u201cWe\u2019re aiming high. We want to capture as much as we can, and although this seems farfetched, I truly believe that with the current existing technologies, i.e. ubiquitous smartphones and the Bitcoin technology, this is now achievable. The timing is right, and with partners like ZipZap, building the open remittance network on top of the blockchain is now a reality. Cost of remittances is a huge pain point (USD 2B huge) for a lot of my fellow countrymen, and that is what ultimately motivates us to bring a faster and cheaper service to market.\u201d\nProcess\nThe process of sending remittance or, as the company calls it, a \u201crebittance,\u201d via rebit.ph is simple. Users can use the ZipZap application which acts as an on-ramp interface for remitters.\nThen, the users \u201care asked how much they want to send in Candadian dollars, plus the corresponding recipient details, and as soon as they hit \u201csend,\u201d the transaction goes through the Bitcoin network.\n\u201cIn a matter of minutes, we process the transaction at Rebit and cash in PHP is made available for the recipient through whatever payout method the remitter nominated,\u201d Bailon said. \u201cFor both remitter and receiver, the bitcoin part is invisible, they don\u2019t have to know how the funds were sent accross the network, what they know is that it\u2019s a more convenient and cheaper way to send money back home.\n\u201cBecause we use Bitcoin at Rebit, we\u2019re open to receive transactions from any individual or company, effectively an open network for remittances,\u201d explained Bailon.\nPossible Expansion\nUltimately, Satoshi Citadel Industries intends to expand its services and \u201ctarget the top 10 locations where there is significant Filipino migrant worker population,\u201d including UAE, Singapore and Hong Kong.\nToday, residents of Australia, Canada, Japan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Taiwan and many other Asian countries can transfer and send money using bitcoin to remittance outlets and banks in the Philippines. Through partnerships with local banks and financial institutions, Rebit.ph has made it extremely easy for Filipino expat workers to send payments, and Filipino residents to receive transactions at remittance outlets, which are available across the country.\n\u201cBy partnering with companies such as ZipZap, we\u2019ve made sending remittances to the Philippines via Bitcoin easy, cheaper and faster compared to traditional methods.. It\u2019s like Western Union, except it\u2019s open to for anyone to participate in. We jokingly call this network the Eastern Union,\u201d added Bailon.", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 15}

{"title": "The Decentralist Perspective, or Why Bitcoin Might Need Small Blocks", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/decentralist-perspective-bitcoin-might-need-small-blocks-1442090446/", "birthday": "Sep 12, 2015  4:40 PM EST", "date": "2015-09-12 21:40:00", "content": "Aaron van Wirdum is interested in decentralized consensus, FOSS, privacy in the digital age, censorship resistant payments, and more of that stereotypical Bitcoin stuff. Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\n\u00a0The block-size limit debate has dominated Bitcoin blogs, forums, chat rooms and meet-ups for months on end, while many of Bitcoin\u2019s brightest minds are gathering in Montreal to discuss the issue face-to-face at the\u00a0Scaling Bitcoin Workshop\u00a0this weekend.\nSo far, however, the two sides of the debate have made little progress coming to a consensus. At least for some part, this seems to result from a difference of visions \u2013 visions that are based on a different set of priorities.\nOne of these visions \u2013 represented by Bitcoin XT developers Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn \u2013 is straightforward and clear. For Bitcoin to succeed, they believe it needs to grow, preferably fast. And for Bitcoin to grow fast, it needs to be cheap, accessible and easy to use. This, in turn, means that the block-size limit needs to increase in order for more transactions to fit on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, for fees to remain low, and without having to rely on complicated and far-off alternative solutions. This could mean that some aspects of the Bitcoin ecosystem need to specialize further, but that was always to be expected.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, a majority of Bitcoin\u2019s most active developers think it\u2019s not that simple. For them, Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature is sacrosanct, and they believe that an increase of the block-size limit represents a trade-off with this core feature. Some of these developers \u2013 perhaps best described as Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cdecentralists\u201d \u2013 even warn that too big an increase could destroy the system as a whole.\nBut for many outside this select group developers it still seems unclear why, exactly, big blocks could pose such a grave threat. To find out,\u00a0Bitcoin Magazinespoke with four of the most prominent of these decentralists: Bitcoin Core developer Dr. Pieter Wuille, Bitcoin Core developer and long-term block-size conservative Peter Todd, hashcash inventor and Blockstream founder and president Dr. Adam Back, and well-known cryptographer and digital currency veteran Nick Szabo.\nMining Centralization\u00a0\nAccording to decentralists, the problem of big blocks is essentially twofold. On one hand there is the basic assumption that bigger blocks favor bigger miners \u2013 presumably mining pools. On the other hand is the fact that bigger blocks complicate mining anonymously.\nThe main (though not only) reason bigger blocks favor bigger miners has to do with latency. As the block size increases, so does the time it takes for a newfound block to transmit through the Bitcoin network. That is disadvantageous to all miners, except for the miner that found the block. During the time it takes a new block to make its way through the network, the miner who found the block gets a head start mining on top of the new block, while other miners are still busy mining on top of an older block. So as a miner find more blocks, it gets more head starts. And as a miner gets more head starts, it finds more blocks. Meanwhile on the other end of the equation, smaller miners find fewer blocks and, as a result, have more trouble turning a profit, ultimately causing them to drop off the network. Bigger blocks tend to centralize mining.\nThis problem is worsened, moreover, if a miner wishes to remain anonymous, and wants to use Tor. Since latency on the Tor network is always higher, the problem as described above is simply magnified. If smaller miners are disadvantaged by bigger blocks to the point where it\u2019s hard to remain profitable on a regular connection, miners using Tor don\u2019t even stand a chance.\nNeither of these arguments against bigger blocks is controversial in itself. The controversy lies in the question how big is too big. Andresen and Hearn believe an increase to 8 megabytes or even 20 megabytes should be OK, and assume that it\u2019s fine to grow this limit to 8 gigabytes over a 20-year time period.\nSpeaking to\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine, Bitcoin Core developer and Blockstream co-founder Dr. Pieter Wuille explained why this assumption is not shared by decentralists.\n\u201cIt is obvious that block propagation is too slow\u00a0already,\u201d Wuille said. \u201cA recent software update revealed that several mining pools maintain arrangements where they share block headers \u2013 the minimal required part of an actual block \u2013 the moment they find a new block. All miners in on the deal then start mining on top of that block header instead of waiting for the full block to propagate over the network \u2013 waiting would cut into their profits too much.\u201d\nExplaining why this is a problem, Wuille continued:\n\n\u201cThis practice is harmful for Bitcoin, as it requires a lot of trust among miners. They no longer verify the validity of blocks individually, and instead just rely on their peers. But validating blocks is supposed to be a miner\u2019s main task on the Bitcoin network\u2026\u201d\n\nMoreover, decentralists warn there might be no turning back once bitcoin mining has become too centralized. At that point, the remaining miners could have created a deadlock on the mining market, essentially preventing newcomers to compete profitably.\nCore developer and long-time block-size conservative Peter Todd told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n\u201cThe big concern we have here is, as we reduce these security margins, we\u2019ll see the already worryingly small number of pools decrease even further. Even more concerning though, is that while currently it\u2019s pretty easy to start a new pool if an existing one \u2018goes rogue,\u2019 bigger blocks can make it much more difficult to do so, because from the beginning you\u2019ll be much less profitable than the big pools.\u201d\n\nAnd while it has been suggested that miners can connect to a VPS if they prefer to remain anonymous rather than connect through Tor, this is not quite satisfying for decentralists either. Speaking to\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine, hashcash inventor and Blockstream CEO Dr. Adam Back explained why.\n\u201cIt is technically possible to mine using a VPS (Virtual Private Server), but miners who do so are not choosing their own transactions,\u201d Back emphasized. \u201cInstead, they connect to a server that does this for them. It\u2019s another form of centralization, at the extreme. And we\u00a0already\u00a0see this happening due to bad connectivity in some countries, where miners use VPS services set up in another country to win some time and increase profits\u2026\u201d\nRegulation\nDecentralization \u2013 and anonymity \u2013 might be sacrosanct for decentralists, but that does not mean they are goals in and of themselves. Instead, decentralists cling to these properties because they believe the health of the Bitcoin network relies on them. It\u2019s only through decentralization and anonymity that the system can remain free from outside influence, such as government regulation.\n\u201cBitcoin achieves policy neutrality by decentralization of mining,\u201d Back explained. \u201cIf one miner won\u2019t mine your transaction, another will. It\u2019s an additional benefit if miners are many, geographically dispersed and anonymous, since it\u2019s complex to coordinate a policy imposition on many small geographically dispersed miners. And it\u2019s even more complex to impose policy on someone who is anonymous.\u201d\nIf, on the other hand, Bitcoin reaches the point where only a handful of professional miners will be able to profitably partake in the process of Bitcoin mining, and if these miners are no longer able to do so anonymously, decentralists worry that Bitcoin\u2019s fundamental properties might be at risk.\n\u201cIt is pretty clear that forcing the Bitcoin protocol to implement anti-money laundering policy and blacklisting of funds is a long-term goal of governments, which can be done by pressuring mining pools,\u201d Todd explained. \u201cBeing able to tell regulators that pressure will simply cause pools to leave regulated jurisdictions is important, but without anonymity, there really aren\u2019t that many jurisdictions to run to.\u201d\nFurthermore, once more that half of all hashing power is effectively regulated, authorities could even demand a complete freeze of certain funds, Back explained:\n\n\u201cIf more than 50 percent of mining is subject to policy, it can actually censor any transaction by ignoring \u2013 orphaning \u2013 blocks made by other miners. We don\u2019t know if that would happen or not, but given the fact that it would be within their technical power to do it, it should be expected that regulators demand their regulations achieve an effect.\u201d\n\nMoreover, once this sort of regulation does set in, decentralists believe it will probably be too late to fix. Bitcoin would be caught in a regulatory trap without even noticing it \u2013 until the trap closed.\nBack continued:\n\n\u201cIf Bitcoin is already at high policy risk \u2013 sort of effectively centralized but not experiencing the side-effects of that yet \u2013 and then the policy problem arises, the properties of Bitcoin are lost or eroded. How can you fix it at that point? Suddenly decentralize it? It\u2019s uncertain that the parties who are at that point under central control over the Bitcoin network have the free choice to work to decentralize it. They would have been regulatory captured.\u201d\n\nFull-Node Centralization\nBut even mining centralization and regulation might not be the end of it, decentralists warn. Ultimately, over-sized blocks bear with it another \u2013 perhaps even bigger \u2013 risk: full-node centralization.\nFull-node centralization could be an even bigger risk than mining centralization, decentralists argue, as full nodes effectively verify the consensus rules Bitcoin plays by. These consensus rules enforce that Bitcoin has a 1MB block-size limit, but also that the block reward halves every four years, or that the total supply of bitcoin will not exceed 21 million. And \u2013 importantly \u2013 being able to verify these rules is what makes Bitcoin a trustless solution. In essence, full nodes allow users to check that Bitcoin does as promised.\nBut as it becomes expensive to run a full node, decentralists worry that verifying the consensus rules could become reserved to a small elite. This could have several consequences.\nAn obvious consequence would be that it injects trust in the system. Instead of using trustless full nodes, users would, for instance, use web-wallets \u2013 which obviously require a lot of trust in the service. But even solutions such as Simplified Payments Verification (SPV) nodes are no better in this regard, as they do not verify the consensus rules either.\nPeter Todd explained:\n\n\u201cSPV nodes and wallets are not a trustless solution. They explicitly trust miners, and do no verification of the protocol rules at all. For instance, from the perspective of an SPV node there is no such thing as inflation schedule or a 21 million bitcoin cap; miners are free to create bitcoins out of thin air if they want to.\u201d\n\nAnd while the cheating of SPV nodes could be seen as a short-term problem, some decentralists argue that a drop in full nodes might even have more severe consequences in the longer term.\nAccording to Wuille:\n\n\u201cIf lots companies run a full node, it means they all need to be convinced to implement a different rule set. In other words: the decentralization of block validation is what gives consensus rules their weight. But if full node count would drop very low, for instance because everyone uses the same web-wallets, exchanges and SPV or mobile wallets, regulation could become a reality. And if authorities can regulate the consensus rules, it means they can change anything that makes Bitcoin Bitcoin. Even the 21 million bitcoin limit.\u201d\n\nIt is of vital importance for the health of the Bitcoin network, therefore, that it remains possible to run full node anonymously, Todd urged:\n\n\u201cLike mining, having the option to run full nodes totally \u2018underground\u2019 helps change the discussion and gives us a lot of leverage with governments: try to ban us and you\u2019ll have even less control. But if we don\u2019t have that option, it starts looking like regulation efforts have a decent chance of actually working, and gives governments incentives to attempt them.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the block size limit debate itself, Back added:\n\n\u201cI believe that the unstated different assumption \u2013 the point at which views diverge \u2013 is the importance of economically dependent full nodes. It seems that Gavin thinks a world where economically dependent full nodes retreat to data-centers and commercial operation \u2013 and basically all users can only get SPV security \u2013 is an OK trade-off and cost of getting to higher transaction volume a year early. But most of Bitcoin\u2019s technical experts strongly disagree and say this risks exposing Bitcoin to erosion of its main differentiating features.\u201d\n\nTrade-Offs\nSo what if decentralists are right? Bitcoin mining, and perhaps even running a full node, is reserved to specialists working from data centers. Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer policy might be imposed, and perhaps the protocol rules are regulated to a certain extent. Sure, it would be a blow for drug dealers, CryptoLocker distributors and extortionists, but Bitcoin would still be a global, instant and cheap payments system. In a way, Bitcoin might actually be better of without these outlaws. Right?\nWell, not according to decentralists.\nMost decentralists maintain that Bitcoin\u2019s distinguishing features are not its global reach, its instant transactions, or its low costs of use. Instead, they argue, Bitcoin\u2019s single most important distinguishing feature is its decentralized nature. Without it, there would be no reason for Bitcoin to even exist.\nWell-known cryptographer and digital currency veteran Nick Szabo explained:\n\n\u201cIn computer science there are fundamental trade-offs between security and performance. Bitcoin\u2019s automated integrity necessarily comes at high costs in its performance and resource usage. Compared to existing financial IT, Satoshi made radical trade-offs in favor of security and against performance. The seemingly wasteful process of mining is the most obvious of these trade-offs, but it also makes others. Among them is that it requires high redundancy in its messaging. Mathematically provable integrity would require full broadcast between all nodes. Bitcoin can\u2019t achieve that, but to even get anywhere close to a good approximation of it requires a very high level of redundancy. So a 1MB block takes vastly more resources than a 1MB web page, for example, because it has to be transmitted, processed and stored with such high redundancy for Bitcoin to achieve its automated integrity.\u201d\n\nThe crucial importance of this trade-off, was seconded by Wuille:\n\n\u201cIf we were to allow centralization of mining, we simply wouldn\u2019t need a blockchain in the first place. We could just let a central bank sign transactions. That would allow us much bigger and faster blocks without any capacity problems. No variable block times. No wasted electricity. No need for an inflation subsidy. It would be better in every sense, except that it would involve some trust. Really, if we don\u2019t consider centralization of mining a problem, we might as well get rid of it altogether.\u201d\n\nSzabo added:\n\n\u201cThese necessary trade-offs, sacrificing performance in order to achieve the security necessary for independent and seamlessly global automated integrity, mean that Bitcoin cannot possibly come anywhere near Visa transaction-per-second numbers and maintain the automated integrity that creates its distinctive advantages versus these traditional financial systems.\u201d\n\nBitcoin versus bitcoin\nThis leaves us with one last question. If \u201cBitcoin cannot possibly come anywhere near Visa transaction-per-second numbers\u201d as decentralists claim, then what is the point of it all? Why even bother building software, investing in startups, and spend time evangelizing Bitcoin, if it inherently doesn\u2019t scale?\nThe point of it all, for decentralists, lies in a classic distinction: the distinction between Bitcoin the network and bitcoin the currency.\nBitcoin the network, decentralists argue, is fundamentally designed as a settlement system,\u00a0not\u00a0as a network for fast and cheap payments. While maybe not the most typical decentralist himself, a recent\u00a0contribution\u00a0to the Bitcoin developer mailing list by Core developer Jeff Garzik perhaps explains the decentralist perspective best.\nGarzik wrote:\n\n\u201cBitcoin is a settlement system, by design. The process of consensus \u2018settles\u2019 upon a timeline of transactions, and this process \u2013 by design \u2013 is necessarily far from instant. \u2026 As such, the blockchain can never support All The Transactions, even if block size increases beyond 20MB. Further layers are \u2013 by design \u2013 necessary if we want to achieve the goal of a decentralized payment network capable of supporting full global traffic.\u201d\n\nBut, importantly, this vision of Bitcoin as a limited settlement network, does not mean that\u00a0bitcoin the currency\u00a0cannot flourish beyond these built-in limits.\nAs explained by Szabo:\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to small-b bitcoin, the currency, there is nothing impossible about paying retail with bitcoin the way you\u2019d pay with a fiat currency \u2013 bitcoin-denominated credit and debit cards, for example, with all the chargeback and transactions-per-second capabilities of a credit or debit card. And there are clever trust-minimizing ways to do retail payments in the works. Capital-B Bitcoin, the blockchain, is going to evolve into a high-value settlement layer, and we will see other layers being used for small-b bitcoin retail transactions.\u201d\n\nOr as Garzik elaborated:\n\n\u201cBitcoin payments are like IP packets \u2013 one way, irreversible. The world\u2019s citizens en masse will not speak to each other with bitcoin (IP packets), but rather with multiple layers (HTTP/TCP/IP) that enable safe and secure value transfer or added features such as instant transactions.\u201d\n\nMoreover, decentralists contend that even these upper layers could include most of the advantages that the Bitcoin network introduced. Once fully developed, technological innovations such as the Lightning Network and tree-chains should allow users to transact in a decentralized, trustless, and even instant fashion \u2013 while ultimately settling on the Bitcoin blockchain. While it is true that on-chain transactions will cost more as room in blocks becomes scarce, decentralists maintain that it is the only way to keep that chain decentralized and trustless \u2013 and that that does not need to be a problem.\n\u201cYes, on-chain transaction fees will rise,\u201d Todd acknowledged. \u201cBut that changes what you use Bitcoin\u2019s underlying blockchain layer for, and how often \u2013 not whether or not you can transact at all. A world where you can send anyone on the planet money directly on the blockchain for five dollars \u2013 or for near zero via caching techniques like Lightning \u2013 is a very good option, and it will buy us time to develop techniques to make blockchains themselves scalable \u2026\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 12}

Apart from the substantial fee for transactions and payments, PayPal and the bank transfers have been extremely inefficient, freezing funds for weeks at their will.\n\nIn search for a cheaper, yet quicker, payment method, Budafoods founder Mark Burgunder came across bitcoin, a decentralized currency which enables instantaneous and cheap transactions for merchants and small businesses.\n\n\u201cMy main reason for attempting to get others to accept bitcoins is that I love the speed and ease of bitcoin payments and have a distrust of most central banking methods,\u201d Burgunder told\u00a0\nBitcoin Magazine.\n\n\n\u201cOn a deep emotional level, fractional reserve banking feels like cheating to me and has only been successful because it benefited the already rich,\u201d he said. \u201cAdditionally through experience with credit card processing and using PayPal I have realized that not only are merchants/sellers charged a substantial fee for accepting money, but we also need permission from the banks, credit card companies and/or PayPal to accept payments.\u201d\n\nUnlike most companies that claim to accept bitcoin, Budafoods is not converting the bitcoin it accepts to fiat money.\n\n\u201cIn Australia, a surplus of bitcoins wouldn\u2019t be an issue as we currently have a great service available here called Living Room of Satoshi that allows us to make bill payments and electronic transfers to almost any bank account in Australia using bitcoins. We\u2019ve been using this service on a number of occasions already with the largest purchases so far having been for chicken feed and for mobile electric fencing,\u201d Burgunder told\u00a0\nBitcoin Magazine.\n\n\nClosed Bitcoin Economy Among Farmers\n\nAs computer scientist and cryptographer Nick Szabo stated before, suppliers, businesses and customers must all accept and use bitcoin for it to be effective in an economy. Szabo calls this concept a complete closed cycle: store => supplier = workers => store.\n\nBurgunder attempts to implement this concept into the local farm and business networks in Queensland. Currently, Budafoods is trying to convince local businesses in its community to accept and pay them in bitcoin, as it is faster and cheaper than other online payment methods available in Australia.\n\n\u201cWe are supplying one of the local restaurants and would be more than happy to accept payment in bitcoins from this restaurant. We feel this should make it easier to allow the restaurant to accept bitcoins from tourists and, in turn, pay us for supplies with the bitcoins they\u2019ve accepted,\u201d said Burgunder.\n\nThe Use of Multi-Sig Wallets between a Supplier and a Business\n\nBurgunder further explained that the use of multi-signature wallets between a supplier and a business will be far more efficient than any other payment method/systems available today.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d envisage in an escrow scenario we\u2019d pay for the purchase into a multi-sig wallet with one of the signatures being ours, with us signing a transaction to release the funds to the supplier once we\u2019ve received the shipment,\u201d explained Burgunder. \u201cWith the supplier also having one of the multi-sig keys it wouldn\u2019t be possible for us to just withdraw the funds, giving the supplier certainty that the funds will not disappear on them. I feel this would help incentivize the supplier to assist in speedy and hassle-free delivery as in this scenario it would be in their interest to have the shipment arrive with us in a timely manner.\u201d\n", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 17}

The new platform would operate without a native currency like bitcoin and be used to keep track of B2B \u2013 business to business, bank to bank, and bank to business \u2013 transactions and enforce smart contracts.\n\nThe new IBM software platform will permit creating digital contracts that \u2013 like bitcoin transactions \u2013 would be recorded publicly and securely on a worldwide computer network.\n\n\u201cBlockchain, as a technology, is extremely interesting and intriguing,\u201d said Arvind Krishna, senior vice president and director of IBM Research. \u201c\u201cI want to extend banking to the 3.2 billion people who are going to come into the middle class over the next 15 years. So I need a much lower cost of keeping a ledger. Blockchain offers some intriguing possibilities there.\u201d\n\nKrishna\n\n, who previously was general manager of IBM Systems and Technology Group\u2019s Development and Manufacturing organization, leads IBM\u2019s overall technical strategy, overseeing a global organization of approximately 3,000 scientists and technologists located at 12 labs on six continents.\n\nOver the past year, dozens of IBM researchers have been developing their own blockchain-based technology for secure online smart contracts. Krishna said that the project \u2013 which is still considered as an experimental project by IBM \u2013 could log transactions between banks or international businesses, or even let banks and businesses share the same system of record.\n\nFor example, once a Chinese supplier and a U.S. buyer agree that a product had been delivered, a U.S. bank could pay the supplier instantly over the Internet.\n\nThe IBM researchers are modifying the original bitcoin ideas to build a blockchain that operates without currency, ensures that contract details remain private and makes it easier for companies to embed business rules into their smart contracts \u2013 for example, automatically paying for a package upon delivery.\n\nExtremeTech\n\u00a0notes\n\n\u00a0that this is the first time the concept of blockchain-based smart contracts is backed by a company as large and powerful as IBM. With a track record of successful open-source software solutions, and with its name and reputation behind their blockchain idea, IBM could convince major companies to get on board.\n\nSmart contracts are computer programs that can automatically execute the terms of a contract. In 2001, legendary cryptographer Nick Szabo\u00a0spoke\n\n\u00a0of smart contracts that solved the problem of trust by being self-executing, and having property embedded with information about who owns it. For example, the key to a car might operate only if the car has been paid for according to the terms of a contract.\n\nNow, Szabo\u00a0expects\n\n\u00a0emerging \u201cBitcoin 2.0\u201d smart contracts platforms likeEthereum\n\n\u00a0to have a disruptive impact on financial and legal systems, comparable to that of Bitcoin itself. \u201c[E]ventually more so, since Ethereum\u2019s more flexible and general language can facilitate a much wider variety of commercial and other formal relationships,\u201d said Szabo.\n\nHowever, according to the scarce information about the IBM project that has been released so far, there seems to be an important difference between Ethereum and the upcoming IBM platform: the concept of \u201cminers\u201d \u2013 end users who contribute computing to validate transactions and receive a financial reward in the native crypto-currency carried by the blockchain \u2013 would be absent in IBM\u2019s implementation.\n\nTherefore, it appears that IBM wants to go one step beyond the now fashionable concept of\u00a0permissioned blockchains\n\n, where only approved financial operators and governments are allowed to validate transactions, and implement a blockchain without a native crypto-currency, to be used only for record-keeping and smart contracts.\n\nIBM has been doing research on blockchain technology for some time \u2013 at CES 2015 it unveiled ADEPT, a system developed in partnership with Samsung that leverages elements of blockchain technology to coordinate a decentralized Internet of Things.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn March,\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine\n\u00a0reported\n\n\u00a0that, according to solid rumors, IBM was developing a digital cash and payment system for major currencies, \u201csort of a Bitcoin but without the bitcoin,\u201d and discussing the project with a number of central banks, including the Federal Reserve, in view of possible adoption by governments.\n\nThe new project described by Krishna is unrelated to ADEPT, but it could be related to the rumors reported in March. It\u2019s evident that, if IBM were to become the preferred partner of governments for next-generation fintech based on blockchain technology, the payoff could be huge. It\u2019s unclear, however, how IMB plans to achieve operational robustness and scalability without crowd-sourcing the operations of the blockchain to properly incentivized miners.\n\n\nPhoto\u00a0Mr Seb\n\u00a0/\u00a0Flickr (CC)\n\n", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 18}

The new platform launches in this month with a competition in collaboration with the\u00a0\nCollege Cryptocurrency Network\n\n.\n\n\nFor the uninitiated, financial derivatives are simply contracts agreed upon between two parties: whoever holds the asset, in this case, bitcoin, and whoever wants to speculate on the future price of the asset. One of the most popular types of derivatives, a call, is defined as the right to purchase an asset at a preset price, called a strike price, before some date in the future. Should the market price increase above the strike price, the option owner purchases and immediately sells the asset, pocketing the difference.\n\nIn exchange for signing the contract, the option purchaser pays whoever owns the asset a small fee. Asset owners enter into these types of contracts for the guaranteed income, and the option purchasers are incentivized with the large upsides associated with this type of trading. Other popular financial derivatives include puts, where the option owner reserves the right to purchase an asset at a specific price up until a period of time, and futures, where the owner must purchase the asset at a specific price on a specific day in the future.\n\nUsers can purchase financial derivatives offered by Alt-Options in order to both speculate on large bitcoin price movements and decrease volatility. For instance, if a user believed the price of bitcoin was going to increase above $300 sometime in the next six months, he or she could purchase a call at $300 for a small fee. If the price were to reach $350 before six months passed, the user would exercise his option, the bitcoin would be sold on the open market, and the user would pocket $50. If the user\u2019s prediction proved incorrect, the asset owner who sold him the option would simply keep the small fee.\n\nHowever, if a user wanted to protect herself from a price drop below $250 in the next six months, she would purchase a put at $250 on her personal balance of bitcoin on the Alt-Options platform, again paying a small fee. Should the price fall below $250, she would exercise her right to sell her bitcoin for the strike price of $250, protecting her from volatility in the bitcoin market. And while this arrangement may not seem revolutionary, calls and puts play an important role in the world market today by allowing large players to hedge against large swings in the market.\n\nFinancial derivative exchanges have been lucrative for years. Founded in 1898, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange took in $3 billion in 2010. At the end of March 2008, the notional amount of all outstanding positions stood at $81 trillion, according to the Bank for International Settlements.\n\nWhile Alt-Options is currently regulated by Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) regulations, it has been able to bypass stricter guidelines by using \u201cstrong partnerships with regulated (bitcoin) exchanges,\u201d said Alt-Options co-founder Joe Zhou in a recent interview. \u201cThere are no specific guidelines regarding digital assets, but we foresee some sort of regulation or set of guidelines from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the future.\u201d\n\nAlt-Options aims to find the same volume that allowed Chicago Mercantile Exchange to prosper with bitcoin trading. With tools typically found on pro-trading platforms and American-style options for retail clients, a team of students is hoping to revolutionize the way mining firms liquidate assets, hedge risk and manage the incredible amounts of bitcoin they generate every day while allowing casual and professional traders to experiment with bitcoin.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 17}

In 2013, she completed 12 years at Alliance Bernstein as chief investment officer of Global Thematic Strategies with nearly $5 billion in assets under management and superior long-term investment returns.\u00a0New York Business Journal\n\u00a0notes\n\n\u00a0that ARK has holdings in LinkedIn, Amazon, Facebook and Netflix, which says much about Wood\u2019s ability to pick stocks of disruptive technology companies with high potential for growth.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been watching [Bitcoin] for a long time, not long after Satoshi Nakamoto, whoever he or she is, designed it,\u201d\u00a0Wood said to\u00a0New York Business Journal\n\n\n. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at something now that\u2019s stabilized.\u201d Grayscale\u2019s director of sales Michael Sonnenshein added that ARK can\u2019t hold bitcoin directly \u2013 because bitcoin is considered as property by the IRS in the United States \u2013 but can hold Bitcoin Investment Trust shares. \u201cRather than them purchase bitcoin directly, the way they can purchase shares of Apple and Tesla, they can buy shares in the Bitcoin Investment Trust,\u201d he said.\n\nIn March,\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine\n\u00a0reported\n\n\u00a0that Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Investment Trust received formal\u00a0approval\n\u00a0for listing on the\u00a0OTC Markets Group\n\u2019s\u00a0OTCQX\n\u00a0exchange, with the symbol\u00a0GBTC\n.\u00a0Trading started\n\n\u00a0in the following week.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to receive an investment into the Bitcoin Investment Trust from an innovative firm like ARK,\u201d said Grayscale Founder Barry Silbert. \u201cARK, a pioneer in the investment community, is in good company. Recent news has highlighted Goldman Sachs, UBS and Citi for their initiatives in the digital currency space.\u201d\n\n\u201cGrayscale is a leader in the bitcoin ecosystem, bridging the gap between digital currency and the broader investment community,\u201d added ARK\u2019s Chief Operations Officer Jane Kanter. \u201cOur investment philosophy is to invest in innovative companies, and we\u2019re glad to be making our own innovative mark within the ETF community.\u201d\n\nAnother ETF focused on Bitcoin, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF (COIN) to be launched by the Winklevoss twins, is still going through the regulatory approval process.\n\nThe ARK investment signals that Wall Street is ready to accept bitcoin as an investment that, as noted by Wood, is now stabilized. Now, ARKW offers investors \u2013 including small investors \u2013 who are bullish about bitcoin, but prefer not to hold it directly, the possibility to bet on bitcoin with a traditional investment vehicle that anyone can buy.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, however, that the considerable increase in Bitcoin adoption and Wall Street incestments in Bitcoin (the technology) in this and last year hasn\u2019t increased the value of bitcoin (the currency). In fact, the price of bitcoin doesn\u2019t grow with adoption \u2013 if anything, it goes down. A reason is that bitcoin is not only a speculative investment, but also a currency that is increasingly used to pay for goods and services \u2013 you can\u2019t buy a beer with Facebook\u2019s stock, but you can buy a beer with bitcoin. Usually, merchants that accept bitcoin sell it for fiat immediately, which brings the bitcoin price down.\n\nTherefore, investors should bear in mind that the growing adoption of bitcoin by consumers and merchants, and the growing Wall Street investments in the Bitcoin system, don\u2019t necessarily result in an increase in the price of bitcoin and the value of investment vehicles tied to the price of bitcoin, such as GBTC and ARKW.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 17}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nAlthough some individuals in the Bitcoin community believed that nothing would come out of the recent\u00a0\nScaling Bitcoin\n\n\u00a0workshop in Montreal, it seems that some progress was made in finding a compromise between the small-block\u00a0\ndecentralists\n\nand the big-block progressives.\n\n\nMultiple discussions between some of the key minds in the\u00a0\nBitcoin Core\n\ndevelopment community took place at the event this past weekend, and it seems the overall goal was to find the key areas of agreement between all of the contributors\u2019 wide-ranging points of view. Rumors were originally swirling around a possible implementation of\u00a0\nAdam Back\n\n\u2019s\u00a0\n2-4-8\n\n\u00a0block-size limit increase proposal, but it appears that the area of agreement is more general than that.\n\n\nA Short-term Bump in the Block-size Limit\n\nInstead of implementing a long-term solution as soon as possible, the majority of Bitcoin Core contributors are interested in a short-term fix. When reaching out toBlockstream\n\u00a0co-founder and President Adam Back to clarify some of the rumors that were swirling around the Montreal workshop, the longtime applied cryptographer pointed to a\u00a0short summary\n\u00a0of the discussions between Bitcoin Core contributors posted to the\u00a0bitcoin-dev mailing list\n\u00a0by Bitcoin Core DeveloperJeff Garzik\n. In his summary, Garzik noted:\n\n\u201cMany [are] interested or at least willing to accept a \u2018short term bump,\u2019 a hard fork to modify block size limit regime to be cost-based via \u2018net-utxo\u2019 rather than a simple static hard limit. \u00a02-4-8 and 17%/year were debated and seemed \u2018in range\u2019 with what might work as a short term bump \u2013 net after applying the new cost metric.\u201d\n\n\nThe 2-4-8 plan is Adam Back\u2019s simple fallback plan of increasing the block-size limit to 2 megabytes now, 4MB in two years, and 8MB in four years. This is similar to Garzik\u2019s\u00a0\nBIP 102\n\n, which simply increases the block-size limit to 2MB on November 11, 2015. The 17 percent per year plan is in reference to Bitcoin Core Developer\nPieter Wuille\u2019s plan\n\n\u00a0to increase the block-size limit in accordance with technological advancements. The 17 percent per year number is\u00a0\nbased on\n\n\u00a0data publicly released by Cisco on an annual basis.\n\n\nAvoiding an Endless Block-size Increase\n\nBlockstream co-founder and Bitcoin Core Contributor\u00a0\nMatt Corallo\n\n\u00a0also\u00a0\nchimed in\n\nin regard to the Scaling Bitcoin discussions on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. He noted that there does not seem to be widespread consensus on the idea of a block size that continues to grow over time. He noted:\n\n\n\u201cStill, the \u2018greatest common denominator\u2019 agreement did not seem to be agreeing to an increase which continues over time, but which instead limits itself to a set, smooth increase for X time and then requires a second hardfork if there is agreement on a need for more blocksize at that point.\u201d\n\n\nMore Work to Be Done in Hong Kong\n\nThere are bound to be more discussions before the next Scaling Bitcoin event in Hong Kong, but that\u2019s where real proposals can be presented alongside test results based on the guidelines for scaling outlined in the Montreal event. Although some view a small block-size limit increase as nothing more than \u201ckicking the can down the road,\u201d the reality is that more time is needed to fully develop long-term solutions, such as the\u00a0\nLightning Network\n\n\u00a0or\u00a0\nflexcap\n\n, that could help Bitcoin scale to millions (or even billions) of users over time. For now, it seems that a simple block-size limit increase to 2MB or 4MB is an area where many notable Bitcoin Core developers and contributors have found some common ground.\n\n", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 18}

The\u00a0Commodity Futures Trading Commission\n\n\u00a0(CFTC) announced on Thursday that it had filed and settled charges against a Bitcoin exchange for facilitating the trading of option contracts on its platform.\n\n\u201cIn this order, the CFTC for the first time finds that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are properly defined as commodities,\u201d notes the\u00a0CFTC press release\n\n.\n\nThe U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent agency of the U.S. government created in 1974, which regulates futures and option markets that are subject to the\u00a0Commodity Exchange Act\n\n. By this action, the CFTC asserts its authority to provide\u00a0oversight of\u00a0the trading\u00a0of cryptocurrency\u00a0futures and options, which will now be subject to the agency\u2019s regulations.\n\n\u201cWhile there is a lot of excitement surrounding bitcoin and other virtual currencies, innovation does not excuse those acting in this space from following the same rules applicable to all participants in the commodity derivatives markets,\u201d said CFTC\u2019s Director of Enforcement Aitan Goelman.\n\nThe CFTC action targets Bitcoin exchange Coinflip, which operated the Bitcoin financial derivatives market Derivabit, and its chief executive officer Francisco Riordan, for \u201cconducting activity related to commodity options transactions without complying with the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC Regulations, specifically, by operating a facility for the trading or processing of commodity options without complying with the CEA or CFTC Regulations otherwise applicable to swaps or conducting the activity pursuant to the CFTC\u2019s exemption for trade options.\u201d\n\nThe website derivabit.com hasn\u2019t been active since mid-2014. A September 2014site snapshot on Internet Archive\n\n\u00a0advertised Derivabit services as \u201cFinancial derivatives to manage exposure to Bitcoin volatility \u2013 Buy & sell option contracts to control your Bitcoin risk\u201d and listed ongoing trades.

So when they find a small one-man startup they can\u2019t resist giving themselves work to do \u2013 so they go in and whack it, especially in California.\u201d\n\nHeard added that he is not terribly surprised and not terribly worried.\n\n\u201cI think the CFTC has a very weak case here and it\u2019s a very creative reinterpretation of what the word commodity means,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ruling will be challenged, and judges will apply common sense and decide it to be a currency.\u201d\n\nSome commentators said that compliance with the Commodity Exchange Act and applicable CFTC regulations would be too costly for many Bitcoin startups, with the predictable result that many innovative U.S. companies will be forced to move offshore.\n\nOthers, in agreement with Hearn, noted that the CFTC claim is inconsistent with related decisions by regulatory agencies in the United States and other countries.\n\nJournalist David Seaman summarized the situation in\u00a0a tweet\n: \u201cTo commodities regulators, Bitcoin is a commodity. To bank regulators, it\u2019s a bank. To stock regulators, it\u2019s a stock. Everyone wants \u2018in.\u2019\u201d\n", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 21}

It is the only secure and sane way of scaling bitcoin solutions for users and developer\u2019s API,\u201d the Coinkite team said.\n\nHardware Security Module stores key data in hardware separate from the server. With several tamper-proof security measures, HSM secures bitcoin of its users on the platform by preventing the theft of the keys. In a potential data breach, hackers may obtain vital information from the server, but the safeguards of HSM prevent the hackers from stealing the keys, thus, eliminating a large probability of bitcoin theft. \u00a0\n\n\u201cOur system is designed in such a way that even if our web servers were to be compromised, the private keys that protect the funds are not stored on those machines.

This first phase of proposals and presentations is intent on setting the stage for further discussions in phase two, which is planned for December 6-7 in Hong Kong, all with the goal of generating the sort of discussion that Lombrozo is referring to.\n\u201cThis conference represents a communitywide effort to understand and characterize the plethora of factors that must be considered before coming to any conclusion about how to best scale Bitcoin,\u201d Eric Martindale told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazineon behalf of Scaling Bitcoin. \u201cOur goal with this first event is to increase awareness of the research that has gone into the scaling problem over the past few years, and encourage a more open dialogue across the entire community.\u201d\nThe debate over the future of Bitcoin and scalability has ramped up over the past few weeks as proponents of one solution or another have taken to social media, discussion boards and blogs to argue various cases.\nOn September 1, in\u00a0an open letter to the Bitcoin community, 32 developers collectively\u00a0 asked people \u201cto not prejudge and instead work collaboratively to reach the best outcome through the existing process and the supporting workshops.\u201d\n\u201cThere are a lot of things we\u2019ve learned about Bitcoin that were unknown a few years ago that change many of the underlying assumptions about how the network functions,\u201d said Lombrozo, who has since become a signatory to the open letter. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of progress in ideas \u2026 but, unfortunately, there\u2019s also a lot of confusion surrounding how Bitcoin can evolve. I hope we can really take a step back and look at what we can do given what we know now \u2026 rather than focusing too much on the way we thought the system should have worked but doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nLombrozo argues that the larger underlying issue is \u201cthe lack of a process that allows us to make progress in situations where we lack near-unanimous agreement for hard forks. Until now, the policy has been to not make these kinds of changes unless everyone agrees.\u201d He adds that while he is looking forward to attending the workshops and seeing what the engineers have to offer, he is also \u201cworking on some proposals to address the consensus-building process between developers more generally.\u201d\nChinese mining pool BW, which provides approximately 8 percent of global mining power, will also be keeping a close eye on what comes out of the two workshops.\n\u201cWe would like this to be an opportunity for everyone to get together and sit down to discuss this important issue,\u201d representatives from the company told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe are in agreement with the spirit of the open letter and look forward to meeting our colleagues from around the world.\u201d\nBW will be sending Mianhuan Li, the manager of their mining farm in Inner Mongolia, to the Montreal workshop. Qingchun Shentu, their resident expert on cryptography and Bitcoin, and doctoral candidate in Signal and Information Processing, will attend the second workshop in Hong Kong.\nOn the other hand, core developer Mike Hearn, who implemented the BitcoinXT fork along with Gavin Andreson, is skeptical about the Scaling Bitcoin workshops.\n\u201cIf you look at how the Bitcoin Core devs and Blockstream have acted so far, this fits their modus operandi perfectly \u2014 stall for as long as possible whilst claiming that we just need more time for the \u2018experts\u2019 to think and debate. But don\u2019t define any way to actually come to conclusions, thus ensuring the debate never ends.\u201d\nThe workshops, which Hearn will sit out while Andresen attends, have explicitly stated that there will be academic and scientific presentations, but no debate. Furthermore, no decisions or pronouncements on scalability will be made during the workshops.\nCore developer and one of the signatories on the open letter, Peter Todd, expressed some skepticism, in correspondence with\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine, that the workshops will be able meet all the demands of the companies attending.\n\u201cIf the data supports raising the blocksize to some level safely, and we can agree on what \u2018safely\u2019 means, that won\u2019t be a hard thing to get consensus on. It\u2019s just unlikely the amount we can safely raise it to will make people happy.\u201d\nHe pointed out that what Andersen and Hearn appear to want \u2014 \u201czero or near zero fees forever with most transactions being on chain\u201d \u2014 appears to be fundamentally impossible by simply changing a constant.\nThe Scaling Bitcoin workshops are hosted by\u00a0CryptoMechanics\u00a0and underwritten by\u00a0Blockstream,\u00a0Chaincode Labs,\u00a0MIT Digital Currency Initiative\u00a0and\u00a0Chain, with further sponsorship support from other Bitcoin and blockchain companies.", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 7}

Now, with the permission of ECUREX,\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine\u00a0is publishing some excerpts of the new report before it\u2019s publicly released.\nThe report is authored by\u00a0Paolo Tasca, research economist at Deutsche Bundesbank and founder of ECUREX, with the support of ECUREX researchers James B. Glattfelder and Nicolas Perony, who also work, respectively, at the University of Zurich and Tamedia Digital. The document represents the author\u2019s personal opinions and does not necessarily reflect the views of the Deutsche Bundesbank or its staff.\n\u201cThe report is very interdisciplinary and aims at talking to technologists who want to know more about economic and legal aspects of digital currencies or economists and lawyers who want to know more about technical aspects,\u201d Tasca told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe think that the report should arrive not only on the desks of executives, but instead it should arrive to the desks of everyone interested in the topic. Thus we decided to put it online available to be downloaded by everyone for free. \u2026[I]t will be online on the ECUREX website.\u201d\nThe report describes the ongoing innovations in the financial sector brought about by digital currencies from a multi-level perspective: systemic, technical, legal and industrial. The document extensively covers the current trends in the domain in order to give the reader a quantitative understanding of the potential opportunities and risks arising from the global adoption of digital currencies. The ECUREX report, which is the result of more than two years of work involving the collection and analysis of data from more than 30 different sources, is the first comprehensive study on digital currencies that provides a joint, deep quantitative analysis of their technological, entrepreneurial, economic and legal aspects.\n\u201cOur goal is to reach the broader possible audience of students and practitioners,\u201d said Tasca. \u201cWe hope that the digital currency market report will become their guide and roadmap that will assist them to navigate the complex and evolving Bitcoin ecosystem. The idea of producing a digital currencies market report started already when I was working as Research Officer at the London School of Economics\u00a0\u00a0(around November 2013) before joining the Deutsche Bundesbank.\n\u201cAt that time I was still mostly working on systemic risk in financial markets, but I perceived and understood the revolution that digital currencies and blockchain technologies would have brought to our socio-economic systems,\u201d he said. \u201cThus, I felt the importance and the need to promote the knowledge of digital currencies and P2P financial systems (more in general) to the broader audience of students, academics and practitioners as much as possible.\u201c\n\u201cAfter two years of work, now I am even more convinced that blockchain technologies will change forever the way we do business (not only in finance).\u201d\nSection 1.3 of the paper, \u201cKey Findings,\u201d is reproduced below with the permission of ECUREX.\nThe most important key findings are summarised here. For the original research and details on the data sources, see the corresponding sections in the main text.\nThe average amount transferred per Bitcoin transaction is larger than in any other major payment network. During the period 2011\u20132015, the average amount (in USD equivalent) per transaction constantly increased, and remained larger than in the major payment networks such as Visa, Mastercard, Discover, or Western Union. Although the Bitcoin payment network is getting closer in total transaction volume to these large networks, its daily transaction volume of ca. USD 50 million (about one quarter of Western Union\u2019s) is still the lowest one.\nThe relative capitalisation of Bitcoin with regard to other digital currencies is receding in favour of Ripple\u2019s. Until mid-2014, Bitcoin dominated the digital currency market by covering up to 95% of its total volume. Since then, its dominant position has been eroded by Ripple, which now covers about 10% of the total market capitalisation. On average, the relative currency strength of Bitcoin has decreased compared to that of the other (almost) existing 500 digital currencies, even though Bitcoin remains dominant on the digital currency market.\nChina is the largest country in the world per:\u00a0\u00a0(1) number of active Bitcoin clients; (2) mining capacity (since the end of 2014, Chinese mining pools cover 50% of the total market share); (3) volume of Bitcoins exchanged via electronic trading platforms (since 2014, the traded CNY/BTC volume in is about 3 times larger than the USD/BTC volume, with peaks at BTC 4 million per week).\nBitcoin startups raised almost USD 1 billion in three years with an annual investment growth rate of about 150%. Capital investments in Bitcoin-related startups is a recent trend that started in the first quarter of 2012. Since then, the Bitcoin industry raised almost USD 1 billion and it represents the fastest growing sector for capital investment. Within the Bitcoin sector, the Mining and Payment & Remittance industries drove the funding race. Coinbase alone covered one third of the capital raised by the whole Payment & Remittance industry, and 21 Inc over half of the capital raised by the Mining industry.\nIn January 2015 the Bitcoin volume exchanged on electronic trading platforms reached 50% of the total number of Bitcoins ever mined at that time. At two points in mid-2014 and January 2015 the volume of Bitcoins exchanged via electronic trading platforms reached a historical high equivalent to over half of the number of Bitcoins that had been mined at that time. Since then, the volume of Bitcoins traded on electronic exchanges has remained stable at a higher value than the volume of transactions between users, recorded in the public Bitcoin blockchain.\nDuring the year 2014, the transaction costs in digital currencies dropped significantly. Throughout 2014, the average fee per Bitcoin (Litecoin) transaction decreased from about USD 20 (7) cents to USD 10 (1) cents.\nThe year 2014 saw fewer incidences and less arbitrage opportunities than the previous years. In effect, the digital currency market is becoming more efficient. Since 2011, Bitcoin\u2019s volatility has been constantly decreasing. In addition, the likelihood and intensity of arbitrage opportunities dramatically dropped to less than 1%, signalling that the digital currency exchange markets are becoming more efficient.\nThe wealth distribution in the Bitcoin ecosystem is highly unequal, and this inequality is growing. The inequality of the distribution of Bitcoins amongst addresses, summarized by the Gini coefficient (higher is more unequal), grew from 0.09 in 2010 to 0.99 in 2015: from quasi-perfect equality to quasi-perfect inequality. However, this is not a \u201crich get richer\u201d phenomenon. During the period 2009\u20132015, the top 100 richest addresses kept a constant relative wealth, totalling about 20% of the total value of the Bitcoin economy. The increase in the inequality is the result of: (1) a socio-economic phenomenon, due to the growing popularity of Bitcoin, and (2) wallet fragmentation due to security practices such as single-use addresses and new addresses generated for change transactions.\nThe Mining industry is consolidating as an oligopoly. The Bitcoin mining market is currently under control by 5 to 7 major mining pools. During the period 2013-2015, the cumulative market share of the largest 10 pools relative to the total market hovered in the 70%\u201380% range.", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 7}

Instead, they would prefer \u201cpermissioned ledgers\u201d owned and by the banks, which can be operated only by vetted players. Think of \u201cBankCoin\u201d blockchains that only the banks and the authorities have access to.\nSince this trend appears to be rising fast, many startups are developing infrastructures for permissioned ledgers.\nSETL is a permissioned ledger system that aims to be as palatable to top-tier banks as possible, with a view to moving cash and assets immediately and achieving settlement finality of transactions,\u00a0International Business Times\u00a0reports. The brainchild of hedge-fund investor Anthony Culligan and Peter Randall, former CEO of leading equities market\u00a0Chi-X Europe, the SETL blockchain system runs alongside and can be integrated into existing systems.\n\u201cIf you make the assumption that the nodes are actually basically benevolent to each other, which they are, of course, if you have got identity attached to it, then the type of cryptography and, therefore, the time it takes gets a lot easier,\u201d said Randall, who is persuaded that vetted identities and capacity within a blockchain system are usefully related. \u201c[I]f you are not talking in the tens of thousands per second, and possibly hundreds of thousands per second, in terms of transactions for financial services globally, you are crazy.\u201d\nFollowing this logic, Randall sees a possible scenario where the major financial players operate their own private blockchains, \u201ca UBS chain and a Deutsche Bank chain and a Morgan Stanley chain and a JP Morgan chain and so on.\u201d But he is persuaded that the BankCoins would eventually have to become interoperable for global reach and increased efficiency.\nSETL\u2019s network would work in the same way as the bitcoin blockchain, generated from each participant\u2019s server. The ledger of transactions would be stored on these servers, with encryption, but regulators or auditors would be given access to identify the parties involved. \u201cWe want to unlock the power of the blockchain for financial markets,\u201d Randall said an interview as\u00a0reported\u00a0by\u00a0Reuters. The technology will be regulator-friendly and \u201cpermissioned,\u201d meaning that participants\u2019 identities can be derived by regulators and auditors if required.\nA similar position was\u00a0recently formulated\u00a0by two Accenture representatives.\n\u201cTo be used by financial institutions, including capital markets firms and insurers, blockchains must supplant the costly methods introduced by bitcoin with a mechanism that guarantees security, privacy and speed without paying for anonymous consensus,\u201d they said.\nBloomberg Business\u00a0is running\u00a0a profile of Blythe Masters, which is also the cover story in the October 2015 print edition of\u00a0Bloomberg Markets. Masters, a financial superstar and a former JPMorgan executive, is the CEO of digital economy startupDigital Asset Holdings. In June, Digital Asset Holdings\u00a0acquired Hyperledger, a company that developed distributed ledger technology to allow banks and other financial institutions to clear and settle transactions in real time. The company\u2019s technology enables financial institutions to create multiple private blockchains across a known group of participants. Unlike other distributed ledgers, Hyperledger does not have an inbuilt cryptocurrency and uses a proven consensus algorithm capable of thousands of transactions per second.\nMasters is persuaded that Hyperledger\u2019s private, permissioned blockchain technology will permit developing \u201cgated communities\u201d where trusted users will be able to process transactions themselves rather than depend on the open bitcoin blockchain, which in her opinion is required for mainstream adoption. \u201cWith private chains, you can have a completely known universe of transaction processors,\u201d Masters says. \u201cThat appeals to financial institutions that are wary of the bitcoin blockchain.\u201d\nThe\u00a0Bloomberg\u00a0article notes that Masters is determined to make the financial system more efficient, using a technology that was initially designed to bypass the financial system \u2013 the technology of Bitcoin \u2013 without the troublesome openness and potential for privacy.\nBut it\u2019s wise to bear in mind one simple fact \u2013 Bitcoin works. While closed, permissioned blockchains and BankCoins might theoretically work tomorrow, Bitcoin works in practice today, and perhaps the chaotic anarchy of the Bitcoin network is the very reason it works.\n\nPhoto\u00a0Carlos Delgado\u00a0/\u00a0CC-BY-SA", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 2}

Later in May, itBit\u00a0was granted\u00a0a trust charter by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYFDS) under New York State banking law, the first such charter granted to a digital currency company by the NYDFS. ItBit also announced the successful completion of a $25 million Series A funding round.\nOn September 2, itBit\u00a0announced\u00a0the appointments of Daniel \u201cDanny\u201d Alter as the company\u2019s new general counsel and chief compliance officer, and Kim Petry as chief financial officer. Petry was previously CFO of global operations and technology at Broadridge Financial Services and, before that, served as CFO and vice president of global commercial/corporate card payment at American Express.\nAlter joined itBit after stepping down in February from his most recent post as general counsel of the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), where he served as principal counsel and strategic adviser to the New York state superintendent of financial services.\nThe former New York State Superintendent of Financial Services Benjamin Lawsky left the NYDFS after\u00a0releasing\u00a0the controversial Bitlicense regulations for digital currency businesses operating in New York. Lawsky\u2019s move to a consulting business was\u00a0strongly criticized\u00a0by the libertarian Cato Institute.\n\u201cBecause of the contacts he made as a regulator, [Lawsky] can hire himself out to Bitcoin companies wanting to signal to other regulators that they have the approval of the regulatory establishment,\u201d\u00a0noted\u00a0Cato Senior Fellow Jim\u00a0Harper.\nIt seems likely that Alter\u2019s move to itBit might be criticized in the same grounds.\n\u201cThe New York State Public Officers law requires that I have a two-year recusal before I can appear before the New York Department of Financial Services on behalf of the company,\u201d said Alter in a pre-emptive statement\u00a0reported\u00a0by\u00a0Reuters. \u201cAnd it will certainly apply to itBit.

The innovation lab is located in Level39, Europe\u2019s largest technology accelerator space for finance and cyber-securities, and focuses on exploring the role of blockchain technology in financial services.\nUBS, a Swiss global financial services company with its headquarters in Basel and Z\u00fcrich, is the biggest Swiss bank and is considered as the world\u2019s largest manager of private wealth assets, with more than 2.2 trillion Swiss francs (CHF) in invested assets.\nIn August, the bank launched a \u201cFuture of Finance Challenge\u201d for financial technology entrepreneurs and startups. The Future of Finance Challenge covers a broad range of emerging fintech areas, including blockchain technology and applications, cryptocurrencies, distributed ledgers, security and privacy verification and smart contracts.\nNow, the blockchain vision and strategy of the giant Swiss bank are becoming clearer. UBS is working on a prototype virtual currency that it hopes will be used by banks and financial institutions as a basis to settle mainstream financial markets transactions,\u00a0The Wall Street Journal\u00a0reports.\nThe new virtual currency, dubbed \u201cutility settlement coin,\u201d would be used for post-trade settlements between financial institutions on private financial platforms built on blockchain technology. For example, UBS might have its own blockchain-based platform to issue bonds, and another bank might have a blockchain-based stock-trading platform, but both would use the same utility coin for settlement.\nThe bank doesn\u2019t plan to issue the new digital coin itself but hopes to work with other banks, regulators and financial service providers for an industrywide product. Hyder Jaffrey, the bank\u2019s e-commerce commercial director, said UBS had already reached out to potential partners, but would not comment on specific institutions.\nThe utility settlement coin is a \u201cpermissioned blockchain\u201d similar to the\u00a0Bankchainproject recently announced by Bitcoin exchange itBit. Permissioned blockchains, also endorsed by\u00a0Accenture\u00a0and Digital Asset Holdings CEO\u00a0Blythe Masters, are the new trend in Wall Street\u2019s uneasy flirtation with Bitcoin. Basically, permissioned blockchains would offer the advantages of digital currencies powered by public blockchain \u2013 fast and cheap transactions permanently recorded in a shared ledger \u2013 without the troublesome openness of the Bitcoin network where anyone can be a node on the network anonymously.\nUsing the utility settlement coin or similar systems, financial institutions could settle trades in seconds rather than days, which could lead to reduced risk, lower operational costs, and increased efficiency. To achieve this vision, UBS is partnering with blockchain fintech startup\u00a0Clearmatics, based in London. The key difference between Clearmatics\u2019 implementation of the blockchain technology and Bitcoin is the fact that only authorized participants can validate transactions. \u201cUnlike cryptocurrency blockchains, validators are authenticated and legally accountable,\u201d states the Clearmatics website.\nA recent post on the Clearmatics website, titled \u201cNo, Bitcoin is not the future of securities settlement,\u201d provides a point-by-point analysis of the original Bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto from the point of view of the financial establishment, and a clear outline of the reasons why banks and mainstream financial institutions won\u2019t touch permissionless blockchain networks like Bitcoin.\n\u201cTo serve as a replacement for the legacy technology implementing registered, book-entry assets, a distributed ledger of financial assets will have to ensure a tight correspondence between what the ledger and the law say is the state of who-owns-what,\u201d notes the post. \u201cThis is obviously incompatible with a protocol based on anonymous transaction validators; the law will not treat a ledger record as authoritative if everyone knows that the current longest chain contains blocks generated by an anonymous attacker who replaced a bit of history that was chronologically prior. But the bitcoin protocol has no mechanism for dealing with this scenario, no mechanism for bringing ledger state and legal state back into alignment.\u201d\nAccording to the company, Clearmatics\u2019 permissioned blockchain infrastructure is not only \u201cthousands of times more efficient\u201d than the Bitcoin network, but also places a governance structure over the validators to ensure resistance to attacks.\nThe Wall Steet Journal\u00a0article wisely mentions critiques to UBS\u2019 approach and permissioned blockchains in general. In particular, former Bitcoin Foundation director Jon Matonis is persuaded that private, permissioned blockchains might fall short of their objectives. \u201cIt could end up being very similar to centralized payments networks we have right now, without the benefit of the network effect of bitcoin,\u201d he said.", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 4}

Development of\u00a0Bitcoin Core\u00a0has somewhat slowed recently due to the\u00a0lack of a clear process\u00a0for reaching development decisions, which is at least part of the reason Andresen joined\u00a0Mike Hearn\u2019s Bitcoin XT project.\nReaching consensus is a terribly difficult task when there are so many different individuals involved in a distributed system, such as Bitcoin, which is why\u00a0Epicenter Bitcoin\u00a0co-host\u00a0Brian Fabian Crain\u00a0asked Andresen about who should have a say in changes made to the protocol.\nEverybody Should Have a Say\nAndresen believes that everyone should be able to have their say through the various communication channels available to them. During the interview, he noted:\n\n\u201cI think everybody should have a say. It\u2019s hard to balance letting everybody speak and not just being drowned out by the noise. If you look on Reddit, anybody can speak there and talk about whatever issue about Bitcoin they care about. It\u2019s hard to find a signal above all the noise. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s impossible, and I think it is fairly clear what the consensus on Reddit is about the blocksize issue. But it\u2019s hard to find more than a high-level, \u2018We think something should be done about this issue.\u2019 When it gets down into the details of exactly what should be done, I think then it gets even harder.\u201d\n\nWhile allowing everyone to participate in the debate is nice in theory, it becomes difficult to find a solution on a social media platform that is well-known for\u00a0jumping to conclusions\u00a0and quickly pulling out pitchforks. In reality, there is a smaller subset of Bitcoin companies, miners and developers who have more pull in the Bitcoin network than the average user. As Andresen explained:\n\n\u201cWho should have the influence? It really comes down to what code are people running and how influential are the people running the code?\u201d\n\nSome Bitcoin Users are More Equal Than Others\nAfter explaining that some Bitcoin users are more influential than others, Andresen began to describe the roles those users play in the Bitcoin ecosystem. He started with exchanges:\n\n\u201cExchanges are incredibly influential at this stage of Bitcoin\u2019s life. Exchanges are a place where a lot of trading is done. Right now, there\u2019s a lot of speculation; exchanges are where that speculation happens. So what the exchanges want to do matters a lot.\u201d\n\nSpeculative trading is still one of the main use cases for bitcoin right now, and anyone who uses an exchange, such as\u00a0Bitfinex\u00a0or\u00a0Coinbase, is subject to the code that the exchange chooses to run on their own servers (as long as the user keeps his or her coin on the trading platform). Of course, users still have the ability to switch to another provider if they don\u2019t agree with the codebase chosen by a particular exchange, but many users of\u00a0bitcoin banks\u00a0are also not overly interested in the code running on the server.\nAndresen also pointed to the importance of\u00a0mining pools:\n\n\u201cMiners are also very influential \u2014 and more than miners, the mining pools that pool together miners are very influential. So I think they have a big influence and a big voice in what happens.\u201d\n\nMiners control the security of the network, but they\u2019ll also want to run the code that will be the most profitable option for them. If a hypothetical hard fork were to take place and split Bitcoin into two different networks, miners would be incentivized to mine on the blockchain with the more valuable coin. This is one of the reasons that the\u00a0Satoshi Nakamoto Institute\u2019s\u00a0Daniel Krawisz\u00a0believes\u00a0investors are ultimately in charge of Bitcoin.\nWhen it comes to the average user, Andresen conceded, \u201cIt\u2019s harder for them to have a huge influence.\u201d\nWho Does Andresen Listen To?\nGavin Andresen also described his own thinking process when it comes to figuring out what he should work on next. The Bitcoin Foundation chief scientist explained that he tries to keep the desires of all bitcoin stakeholders in mind before deciding on his next move:\n\n\u201cThe people who have the biggest voices right now are the developers, the exchanges and the mining pools. Those are the three biggest players. I like to think that, as a developer, I try to listen to all the stakeholders. I try to listen to what long-term bitcoin holders want, what people who are actually transacting with Bitcoin want, [and] what the companies like\u00a0BitPay\u00a0who are supporting merchants want. And try to balance all those things when I think about what am I personally going to be working on as I write code, as I submit pull requests, [or] as I decide what pull requests I\u2019m going to review? I try to channel everybody to prioritize what I work on, and I think all of the other developers do that, too. We probably have different opinions on what\u2019s important to work on next.\u201d\n\nAndresen is on the technical advisory board of a few exchanges and merchant processors, so that\u2019s how he keeps in touch with the concerns at those companies. He also mentioned\u00a0bitcointalk.org\u00a0and Reddit as the two best channels for discussion on changes to Bitcoin by ordinary users \u2014 at least for now.\n\u00a0\nPhoto\u00a0Mikael Altemark\u00a0/\u00a0Flickr (CC)", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 8}

While closed, permissioned blockchains might theoretically work tomorrow, Bitcoin works in practice today, and perhaps the chaotic anarchy of the Bitcoin network is the very reason it works.\nThat\u2019s the opinion of former Bitcoin Foundation director Jon Matonis, who is persuaded that private, permissioned blockchains might fall short of their objectives. \u201cIt could end up being very similar to centralized payments networks we have right now, without the benefit of the network effect of bitcoin,\u201d he\u00a0said.\nNow, legendary cryptographer Nick Szabo has weighed in on current issues in the Bitcoin space, including permissioned blockchains, in an interview published inInternational Business Times\u00a0titled \u201cNick Szabo: If banks want benefits of blockchains they must go permissionless.\u201d\n\u201c[Bank] bureaucracies are so heavily invested in the expertise and importance of local regulations and standards that it\u2019s extremely difficult for them to cut the Gordian knot and implement seamless global systems,\u201d said Szabo. \u201cSo they keep trying to re-inject points of control, and thus points of vulnerability, into blockchains, e.g. through \u2018permissioning\u2019; but this nullifies their main benefits, which come from removing points of vulnerability.\u201d\nOn the contrary, according to Szabo, the banks should embrace the crowd-sourced power and resiliency of permissionless blockchains like Bitcoin.\nIn his book \u201cDigital Gold: Bitcoin and the inside story of the misfits and millionaires trying to reinvent money,\u201d\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0technology and finance reporter Nathaniel Popper\u00a0argued\u00a0that Szabo is the most likely person behind the pseudonymous identity of Bitcoin\u2019s inventor Satoshi Nakamoto.\u00a0A recent interviewwith Adam Back \u2013 another legendary cryptographer \u2013 underlines the key contributions of Szabo in the developments that led to Bitcoin. Szabo\u2019s positions are\u00a0taken very seriously within the Bitcoin community.\nIn the\u00a0International Business Times\u00a0interview, Szabo also weighs in on another very hot topic: the block size. Szabo is against Gavin Andresen\u2019s\u00a0BIP 101 proposal\u00a0to increase the maximum block size from the current 1 megabyte to 8 megabytes, and double it every two years after that until it reaches 8,192MB. Andresen didn\u2019t just submit a proposal, but actually launched\u00a0Bitcoin XT\u00a0as an alternative to Bitcoin Core, which angered other Core developers and notable members of the Bitcoin community.\nAccording to Szabo, a large increase in block size would sacrifice security for performance.\n\u201cIf you reduce the redundancy of messages to allow for larger block sizes, beyond the growth of limiting-resource technology, that reduces the automated integrity that makes Bitcoin distinctive in financial IT,\u201d he says.\nAmong the proposed block-size tweaks currently on the table for discussion, Szabo prefers Bitcoin Core developer Peter Wuille\u2019s proposal,\u00a0BIP 103, which would increase the block size limit by only 17.7 percent per year starting in 2017.\nIn 2001, Szabo\u00a0spoke\u00a0of smart contracts that solved the problem of trust by being self-executing, and having property embedded with information about who owns it.\u00a0For example, the key to a car might operate only if the car has been paid for according to the terms of a contract.\nNow, Szabo expects emerging \u201cBitcoin 2.0\u201d smart contracts platforms likeEthereum\u00a0to have a disruptive impact on financial and legal systems, comparable to that of Bitcoin itself. \u201c[E]ventually more so, since Ethereum\u2019s more flexible and general language can facilitate a much wider variety of commercial and other formal relationships.\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 9}

Instead of generating all the transactions itself, the\u00a0UK-based exchange released the private keys to hundreds of addresses containing small amounts of bitcoin. Thousands of transactions have flooded the network as users seek to send the bitcoin held by these addresses to their own wallets. CoinWallet has indicated that it intends to\u00a0give away $48,000 in free bitcoin using this method. At the time of writing, there were over 70,000 unconfirmed transactions waiting to be processed by the network.\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine\u00a0will keep you updated as the effects of this \u201cstress test\u201d become clear.\nUpdated on 9/2/2015 at\u00a011:43 EST:\u00a0As of September 2, transaction rates indicate that the stress test by CoinWallet has likely begun. At time of writing, over 23,000 transactions were waiting to be confirmed by the network.\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine\u00a0will continue to monitor the network status and provide updates.\nCoinWallet, the U.K.-based Bitcoin mining and wallet business has said it will be running another \u201cstress test\u201d in early September to test the Bitcoin network, according to\u00a0International Business Times.\nThe company told the international journal that this round of \u201ctest\u201d or \u201cspam\u201d attacks \u201cwill likely render most standard wallet software worthless and create nearly a 30-day backlog\u201d in the system.\nBitcoin Magazine\u00a0reached out to CoinWallet to learn more about the company\u2019s plans but received no response by time of publication.\nStress Test will hammer the Bitcoin network\nMuch like its previous stress\u00a0test\u00a0in early July of this year, CoinWallet\u2019s so-called \u201cdust attack\u201d will flood the network with thousands of small, spam-like bitcoin transactions that are large in data but small in value.\nA backlog of thousands of transactions with almost no value (such as 0.0001 bitcoin) waiting to be confirmed can potentially tie up the network for hours.\nMaking it clear which side of the ongoing blocksize debate it\u2019s on, CoinWallet said that it needs to demonstrate that the current Bitcoin blocksize is inadequate and does not meet the demands\u00a0of a growing bitcoin market.\nBitcoin companies take steps to prepare\nAs\u00a0reported previously, exchanges and wallet companies are developing strategies including BitGo\u2019s \u201csurge pricing\u201d to deal with these nuisance attacks and may even at some level appreciate that testing may show the strength of the network.\nMycelium\u00a0Community Manager Dmitry Murashchik told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cMycelium was hit pretty hard by the last stress test, but we have implemented changes to deal with it. On our back-end we moved to a faster database and linked our nodes so they communicate transactions directly to each other to stay in sync.\n\u201cWe changed our wallet to automatically connect to another node if the current one fails, added the option to rebroadcast unconfirmed transactions in case some nodes didn\u2019t hear them, and added dynamic fees calculated based on how clogged up the network is to make sure your transaction still gets included in the next block,\u201d Murashchik added.\nAlena Vranova, CEO of\u00a0SatoshiLabs, says that they are fully prepared for the tests and are also gearing up for an increased blocksize noting, \u201cSome companies attempt to cast fear, uncertainty or doubt on their competitor\u2019s products. Let\u2019s wait for the stress test in practice to judge its impact.\u201d\nVranova sees this exercise as just as much about a political statement as about testing the network:\n\u201cWe strongly feel that the bitcoin community deserves a free and fair debate on the subject: there should be zero censorship around BIP 101 discussions in any forum, including online discussion boards such as BitcoinTalk, /r/Bitcoin, or anywhere else. We stand against any sort of information censorship. A genuinely open approach, with full public access to all available information, is the best way for Bitcoin to proceed.\u201d\nQuadrigaCX\u00a0CEO Gerald Cotten is not really bothered by the upcoming test.\n\u201cWe use BitGo for our hot wallet, a third-party multi-signature wallet solution,\u201d he told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine. One of the ways that we handle this type of thing is that we use a dynamic fee structure which changes based on the network load. Usually, the fee we pay on outgoing transaction is about $0.03. However, when \u2018spam attacks\u2019 are taking place we often increase it automatically to as much as $1 per transaction. Basically, we pay whatever is needed to ensure that the transaction will be confirmed within the next few blocks.\u201d\nMycelium\u2019s Murashchik is taking a positive view of all this saying:\n\u201c[A]lthough the first stress test was painful, it has shown us whatever weaknesses we may have had, which we have since patched, and we are looking forward to the next stress test to see how well those things we implemented will work. We believe we\u2019re ready for it.\u201d\nBitPay also released an\u00a0updated version\u00a0of their Copay wallet that includes dynamic transaction fees to ensure that transactions are confirmed quickly, even during transaction backlogs. \u201cNow Copay users can count on their wallet to scale fee levels based on the bitcoin network load, ensuring their transactions aren\u2019t delayed,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\u00a0\nPhoto\u00a0sara marlowe\u00a0/\u00a0Flickr (CC)", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 10}

The recent funding rounds also showed a significant increase in corporate\u00a0investors, rather than just traditional venture capitalists. These five funding announcements follow several months without any big fundraises\u00a0and may signify that the bitcoin investment market is beginning to heat up again.\nChain Inc. Raises $30 Million from Visa and NASDAQ\nChain Inc., a blockchain software company, has raised\u00a0$30 million\u00a0from Wall Street investors and companies, including Visa Inc., Citi Ventures and NASDAQ Inc., to enable developers and financial institutions to design, deploy and operate blockchain networks to trade and transfer financial assets and smart contracts.\nAs an investor and a strategic partner, NASDAQ will be using the technology of Chain Inc. to facilitate unlisted companies on its private market, without the involvement of third-party startups and developers.\n\u201cWe believe in the power of blockchain technology to transform how financial assets are transferred, but it has to be done with the right partners to ensure it gets off the ground,\u201d said Adam Ludwin, CEO of Chain, in\u00a0an interview\u00a0with\u00a0The Wall Street Journal.\nToday\u2019s banking and financial systems are extremely inefficient; it takes days to weeks to settle and process the transfer of assets or stocks, which also requires the involvement of intermediaries and regulators in its process.\nThe blockchain in contrast, enables instantaneous settlement of payments, transactions and assets, thus cutting a significant portion of the cost of asset trading platforms and companies. Furthermore, the integration of the blockchain technology onto today\u2019s stock market trading platforms could rid the services of intermediaries, which account for a large portion of the costs of major stock market trading platforms such as NASDAQ.\nBitcoin Remittance App Abra Raises $12 Million\nGlobal bitcoin remittance startup Abra has raised more than USD$12 million in aSeries A funding round\u00a0participated in by Arbor Ventures, RRE Ventures and First Round Capital, to further develop the iOS mobile application and to expand the reach of its services to as many countries possible before its official launch.\n\u201c[Abra] is fully leveraging the potential of the technology by reducing friction in financial services. It\u2019s not about bitcoin for the sake of bitcoin \u2013 it\u2019s about how the technology can solve problems for consumers worldwide, even if they don\u2019t know what the blockchain is,\u201d RRE Ventures general partner Jim Robinson told\u00a0CoinDesk.\nAbra, a remittance app launched at the Launch Festival 2015 founded by former Netscape director Bill Barhydt, aims to gather as many trusted \u201ctellers\u201d or users to create a bitcoin-based Western Union type of service that enables users to send and receive bitcoin quickly, anywhere in the world.\nDuring his presentation at the festival, Barhydt\u00a0explained, \u201cOur mission with Abra is to turn every smartphone into a teller that processes withdrawals. This is not just another bitcoin app. The wallet is a full-fledged digital asset management system, and you don\u2019t have to understand it.\u201d\nHardware Bitcoin Wallet Manufacturer Case Raises Another $1 Million\nHardware bitcoin wallet manufacturer and developer Case has added another $1 million to their seed funding round from Future/Perfect Ventures.\nJust yesterday, the Case team\u00a0announced\u00a0their involvement with former JPMorgan executive Blythe Masters\u2019 bitcoin startup Digital Asset Holdings and the development of crypto-security for an interactive marketplace that uses public opinion, news, and other data to produce odds on global event outcomes in a variety of categories including sports, finance and politics, called Pivit.\n\u201cBitcoin and other distributed ledger technologies facilitate the transfer of digital financial assets within cryptographically secured, immutable environments. Case acts as a secure signing device that streamlines this process without increasing the risk of compromising sensitive data,\u201d explained Case CEO Melanie Shapiro in a\u00a0blog post.\nCoinalytics Raises $1.1 Million for Blockchain Data Platform\nCoinalytics, a \u201creal-time intelligence service\u201d for blockchain platforms, has raised USD$1.1 million in a seed round led by a Palo Alto-based startup incubator The Hive. The startup aims to provide risk management assessments and analysis technologies to help bitcoin startups, wallet providers, payment gateways and bitcoin exchanges to conduct risk assessments using blockchain analysis.\nIn\u00a0an interview\u00a0with Coindesk, Coinalytics CEO Fabio Federici explained that its clients can accept bitcoin transactions before they are confirmed by the bitcoin mining network, through its in-house tools for pattern recognition and its blockchain services.\n\u201cWe analyze the inputs of the transaction, the structure of previous transactions and pull in metadata around those inputs to get a feel for whether the customer is reliable,\u201d Federici told Coindesk.\nChronicled Inc. Raises $1.4 Million for Blockchain Authenticity Platform\nChronicled announced a $1.4 million convertible note financing lead by Colbeck with Mandra Capital, Pantera Capital, Social Starts and Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch participating. The company is building a blockchain-based platform to verify the authenticity of consumer goods, such as branded apparel.\n\u201cThe secondary market for luxury goods and collectibles is flooded with fakes, resulting in illiquidity and daunting consumer risk,\u201d said Dan Morehead, CEO of Pantera Capital.\n\u201cChronicled\u2019s technology has the potential to make the market safe and efficient, while giving users a better experience.

At the same time, financial institutions and states find some aspects of Bitcoin worrisome.\nOne concern is that the Bitcoin network relies on anonymous miners to validate transactions. This concern is addressed by various concepts and implementations of \u201cpermissioned blockchains\u201d that are popping up, which would offer the advantages of digital currencies powered by public blockchains but be restricted to banks and vetted financial operators. Permissioned blockchains have been supported by\u00a0Accenture\u00a0and Digital Asset Holdings CEO\u00a0Blythe Masters, andcriticized\u00a0by Jon Matonis and legendary cryptographer Nick Szabo, among others.\nAnother concern is the privacy and semi-anonymity of Bitcoin. Many governments have expressed the position that private digital currencies shouldn\u2019t be tolerated because they can facilitate criminal activities and money laundering, and make tax collection much more difficult. So, on the one hand governments wish to modernize the financial system with blockchain technology, but, on the other hand, they want to remove privacy.\nConcepts and implementations of blockchains without privacy, where all users are explicitly identified, and all transactions traceable by the government by design, are beginning to appear.\nThe website of \u201cidentifiable digital currency\u201d\u00a0GreenCoinX\u00a0highlights a statement of Bill Gates in a 2014\u00a0Bloomberg TV\u00a0interview:\n\u201cThe customers we\u2019re talking about aren\u2019t trying to be anonymous, they\u2019re willing to be known, so Bitcoin technology is key, and you can add to it or you could build a similar technology where there\u2019s enough attribution where people feel comfortable that this is nothing to do with terrorism or any type of money laundering,\u201d said Gates.\nGreenCoinX, developed by GreenCoinX Inc., a company jointly owned by lead developer Nilam Doctor and investment company\u00a0GreenBank Capital Inc, has digital identification built-in.\n\u201cOther cryptocurrencies are not identifiable and, therefore, those cryptocurrencies are not only susceptible to be used for illegal purposes, but are not easily taxable by governments,\u201d state the developers. \u201cThese concerns make global acceptance of cryptocurrency transactions more difficult. GreenCoinX provides a solution by adding email and phone identification to all GreenCoinX transactions. Those intending illegal activities will likely not use GreenCoinX as they can be easily identified. Furthermore, global governments will be able to collect taxes based on GreenCoinX transactions with country-by-country rules for each type of transaction.\u201d\nGreenCoinX is clearly and unambiguously targeted at governments. The developers hope that governments around the world will adopt their digital currency to automate tax collections in the context of an efficient digital economy. The\u00a0government section\u00a0of the GreenCoinX website invites all governments to contact the developers to build custom implementations of GreenCoinX tailored to specific national requirements and laws.\n\u201cGreenCoinX is flexible and modifiable such that each government can decide what identification rules they require for a GreenCoinX transaction and what country-specific taxes should be attached to each transaction,\u201d reads the call for interest. \u201cAdditional parameters can be added on an as-needed basis depending on the requirements of each country.\u201d\nThe\u00a0GNU Taler\u00a0project, promoted by the\u00a0Free Software Foundation\u00a0and developed in the\u00a0GNU\u00a0framework in collaboration with\u00a0INRIA, is a new free software system for electronic payments under development. Unlike BitCoin or cash payments, Taler will be aimed at ensuring that governments can easily track their citizens\u2019 income and thus collect sales, value-added or income taxes. Taler will not be a new currency, but use an electronic mint holding financial reserves in existing currencies such as U.S. dollars, euros or bitcoin.\nThe\u00a0government section\u00a0of the GNU Taler website notes that, with Taler, the receiver of any form of payment is known, and the payment information comes attached with some details about what the payment was made for. \u201cThus, governments can use this data to tax businesses and individuals based on their income, making tax evasion and black markets less viable.\u201d\nHowever, GNU Taler is different from GreenCoinX because, while it doesn\u2019t protect the identity of the merchant, it does protect the identity of the customer. The identity of a customer won\u2019t be revealed to the merchant, and the government won\u2019t be able to learn how consumers spend their electronic money.\n\u201cTo facilitate [end user anonymity], we are developing a system for anonymous payment called GNU Taler,\u201d said Free Software Foundation founder\u00a0Richard Stallman\u00a0in a\u00a0comment\u00a0posted to the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies website. \u201cWith anonymous payment, we can put an end to surveillance-based web services that collect dossiers about their users.\u201d\nThe GNU Taler project seems an interesting attempt to put together two conflicting requirements \u2013 anonymity for consumers and ability for the government to tax merchants. However, the government doesn\u2019t want to know only how much a merchant earns, but also who buys what. Therefore, it seems likely that governments would prefer simpler systems with no privacy at all, such as GreenCoinX.", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 10}

In June, we\u00a0reported\u00a0the official announcement of Android Pay at the annual Google I/O event on May 28 and 29, where Google revealed more information on its upcoming payment platform.\nOn Thursday, September 10, Google\u00a0announced\u00a0that it is beginning to roll outAndroid Pay.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be rolling out gradually over the next few days, and this is just the beginning,\u201d notes the announcement. \u201cWe will continue to add even more features, banks and store locations in the coming months, making it even easier to pay with your Android phone.\u201d\nAndroid Pay works with all NFC-enabled Android devices (running KitKat 4.4+), on any mobile carrier, at every tap and pay-ready location across the U.S. Android Pay will support credit and debit cards from the four major payment networks: American Express, Discover, MasterCard and Visa, issued by the most popular banks and credit unions.\nExisting Google Wallet users will be able to access Android Pay through an update to the Wallet app. For new users, Android Pay will be available for download on Google Play in the next few days. Currently, seven out of 10 Android phones in the U.S. are equipped for Android Pay, and the app will come pre-installed on new NFC-enabled Android phones from AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon Wireless.\n\u201cStarting Thursday, shoppers will be able to use their phone to pay at more than one million retail stores in the U.S. that have point-of-sale registers equipped with near field communication technology, known as NFC,\u201d\u00a0Fortune\u00a0reports. \u201cAndroid Pay incorporates fingerprint biometrics to authenticate payments, whereby people verify their identity by pressing their finger onto their phone\u2019s screens.\u201d\nAndroid Pay is, evidently, Google\u2019s response to Apple Pay. The two systems are remarkably similar, but Android Pay seems more flexible \u2013 as is usually the case when comparing Apple\u2019s walled garden to Android\u2019s more open ecosystem. Android owns a much larger slice of the mobile devices market, especially in the developing world where mobile payments are growing faster.\u00a0According to IDC, Android dominated the smartphone market with an 82.8 percent share in the second quarter of 2015, and it\u2019s the only mobile OS whose share is growing, while iOS, Windows Phone and Blackberry are all declining. Android Pay could, therefore, boost mobile payments.\n\u201cAndroid Pay doesn\u2019t store or transmit your credit card number,\u201d\u00a0notes\u00a0The Wall Street Journal. \u201cInstead, like Apple Pay, it relies on an industry-standard approach called \u2018tokenization.\u2019\u00a0\u00a0After you enter a\u00a0card into Android Pay, the app generates a unique code called a token. Each card has its own token, and each token is specific to each Android. When you make a purchase with Android Pay, this token is used to create yet another temporary token to\u00a0complete\u00a0a purchase.\u201d\nAfter launch, Android Pay will support in-store payments in more than 1 million checkout stands in the U.S. that currently work with Android Pay. Besides adding more stores, Google will enable in-app payments via Android Pay. The feature, according to the\u00a0Android Pay developers website, is coming soon. \u201cAndroid Pay requires no changes to your payment processing,\u201d reads Google\u2019s invitation to developers wishing to integrate Android Pay into their apps. Apparently, Google will offer developers the possibility to channel all sorts of payments in their apps through the enhanced authentication and security features of Android pay, and leave the rest as it is.\n\u201cLeading payment gateways and processing platforms are also adding support to make it even easier for developers to enable Android Pay,\u201c says Google. Bitcoin-friendly companies\u00a0Braintree\u00a0and\u00a0Stripe\u00a0are among the payment processors integrating Android Pay in their platforms.\nIt is also possible that Bitcoin wallet and payment apps developers will integrate Android Pay. According to information currently available, it appears that Bitcoin operators will be able to do so.\n\u201cWe are doing it in a way so that anybody else can build a payments service on top of Android,\u201d Sundar Pichai \u2013 who was\u00a0announced\u00a0as the next Google CEO in August \u2013\u00a0said in March.

MOOCs give anyone, anywhere, the possibility to acquire a world-class education.\u00a0\u00a0Courses include video lectures, exercises and online interaction with teachers and other students. Some courses offer\u00a0certification\u00a0as well.\nThe Princeton Bitcoin course will last six weeks, with the last lecture on November 1, 2015, but students also will be able to follow the video lectures after that date. That\u2019s part of the appeal of MOOCs \u2013students who prefer to learn at their own pace can follow the video lectures asynchronously, when they want, while students who can adapt their schedules to a course\u2019s official timetable have the added benefit of semi-synchronous interaction with the instructors.\n\u201cTo really understand what is special about Bitcoin, we need to understand how it works at a technical level,\u201d notes the Coursera website. \u201cAfter this course, you\u2019ll know everything you need to be able to separate fact from fiction when reading claims about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. You\u2019ll have the conceptual foundations you need to engineer secure software that interacts with the Bitcoin network. And you\u2019ll be able to integrate ideas from Bitcoin in your own projects.\u201d\nThe\u00a0Freedom to Tinker\u00a0website, hosted by Princeton\u2019s\u00a0Center for Information Technology Policy, notes that a preliminary version of the Princeton Bitcoin course has been\u00a0publicly available\u00a0since January, with 11 video lectures, lecture notes and exercises, on the\u00a0Piazza\u00a0online educational platform. The new Coursera version includes new lectures, embedded quizzes to test the students\u2019 understanding, and a wider community of students to discuss the lectures with. About 15,000 students already have signed up, and the enrollment is growing fast.\nThe instructors \u2013\u00a0Arvind Narayanan, Joseph Bonneau, and Edward Felten from Princeton University, and Andrew Miller from The University of Maryland \u2013 are completing the course\u2019s textbook, which will be published by\u00a0Princeton University Press. The draft book chapters will remain freely available online after the publication of the book, but the instructors recommend buying the book.\nThe Princeton course is clearly aimed at a technically oriented, hands-on audience of programmers and computer scientists.\n\u201cHow does our textbook (and course) differ from other books on Bitcoin?\u201d\u00a0wroteNarayanan in the first Princeton announcement in January. \u201cIt\u2019s simple: this is unabashedly a computer science text and course. We connect the ideas we discuss to the rest of computer science, and separate fundamental concepts from implementation details. The hype in the Bitcoin community has sometimes\u00a0gotten ahead of the technology, and we think that for cryptocurrencies to truly realize their potential, entrepreneurs must go back to the basics, rigorously understand the technology and build on it.\u201d\nThe course will be very useful to Bitcoin entrepreneurs and job seekers wishing to enter the very hot digital currency sector. In fact, banks and Wall Street companies are rushing to enter the Bitcoin space and\u00a0fishing for top talent in Bitcoin waters, and online Bitcoin job ads are surging to record highs.\nIn related news, Stanford University is offering a\u00a0Cyber Security Graduate Certificate\u00a0focused on computer systems security, including attack protection and prevention, very important skills in the Bitcoin space.

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nRegulation has always been a contentious issue in the Bitcoin industry. Some members of the community wish to avoid any regulation at all costs, while others want to work closely with regulators to bring clarity to the space as soon as possible. A\u00a0panel on Bitcoin regulation\u00a0was recently featured at the\u00a0American Banker Digital Currency Conference, and it was during this discussion that\u00a0GemCEO\u00a0Micah Winkelspecht,\u00a0Chainalysis\u00a0VP of Business Development\u00a0Jonathan Levin,Chamber of Digital Commerce\u00a0President\u00a0Perianne Boring, and\u00a0Bitcoin FoundationRegulatory Affairs Committee Chairman\u00a0Marco Santori\u00a0were able to discuss the various challenges for Bitcoin startups in the face of impending digital currency regulations around the world.\nIs the BitLicense Too Broad and Flexible?\nThe\u00a0BitLicense\u00a0has been the center of attention when it comes to Bitcoin regulation since it was first announced by Former Superintendent of Financial Services for the State of New York\u00a0Benjamin Lawsky, so it made sense that it was used as an example piece of regulation throughout the panel discussion. During an early portion of the conversation, Santori offered his thoughts on one of the core issues with the BitLicense, which is the broad nature of the language found in the regulation:\n\n\u201cWhat is the difference between a pure software play and a custodial wallet? What kinds of exchanges do act as custodians? These are highly fact-specific questions, and the way that the BitLicense is drafted \u2014 for better or for worse \u2014 it seeks elasticity. It wants to be flexible. I think that\u2019s, on one side, good drafting. On the other side this speaking in metaphor makes it difficult to apply.\u201d\n\nOne of the clearest signs that Bitcoin is difficult to regulate is the elasticity with which the regulation was drafted. As Santori mentioned, there may be unique situations where it is unclear whether or not a startup needs a BitLicense.\nFitting a Round Peg in a Square Hole\nWinkelspecht took the issue of broad regulation in another direction when he discussed\u00a0multi-signature addresses. After explaining what multi-sig addresses are and what they can accomplish, he noted how this kind of innovation could force changes in various legal definitions:\n\n\u201cWhen you think about this new definition of what it even means to own something, it totally transforms the way we think about solving these problems. One of the problems that we have with the regulations the way they\u2019re written is that they\u2019re really geared for trying to fit a round peg in a square hole, in that they don\u2019t take into account the fact that the entire definition of custody and control can change. And so, what does custody or control mean?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to force Bitcoin into the current legal framework because, as Winkelspecht noted, certain aspects of the peer-to-peer digital cash system may require completely new legal definitions. Winkelspecht provided one such example during the panel discussion:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve actually pushed \u2014 so for the legislation in California \u2014 we\u2019ve actually written to the senate to try to get them to add a line, which just defines what they mean by custody or control. That was actually left out of the recent legislation.\u201d\n\nRaising Startup Costs Decreases Innovation\nThe problems associated with stifling innovation through regulation were also brought up by Winkelspecht during this part of the conversation. The Gem CEO explained some of the issues that small startups face when it comes to regulatory uncertainty in the Bitcoin industry:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still very, very murky and very unclear, so from a startup company who\u2019s trying to figure out where you fit in the eyes of the law, it\u2019s very difficult . . . Not having that level of clarity makes it extremely hard to do things like raise investment and actually try to build a sustainable business around it . . . We work every day with brilliant developers who are building solutions, and these are the guys who are actually innovating on things. They need the flexibility to try a lot of things and fail at a lot of things. If you raise the bar of what it takes to just get started, you are massively decreasing the innovation that\u2019s going to come out of that space.\u201d\n\nBoring discussed ways in which a\u00a0nonprofit incubator\u00a0could bring along smaller new businesses before they had the ability to comply with the BitLicense. The Chamber of Digital Commerce had submitted the incubator idea to the\u00a0New York Department of Financial Services\u00a0as a possible solution to the regulatory issues troubling Bitcoin startups during the second comment period for the BitLicense, but the concept was never rolled into the final draft. During his own remarks, Winkelspecht went out of his way to support Boring\u2019s suggestion.\nFor now, it appears there is plenty of work to be done in creating more regulatory clarity for Bitcoin companies and ensuring that innovation is not halted in the name of various legal costs.\n\u00a0\nPhoto\u00a0BTC Keychain\u00a0/\u00a0Flickr (CC)", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 25}

Now, in the first technical post to appear on the Blockstream blog after the announcement of Sidechain Elements, Blockstream and Bitcoin Core developer Pieter Wuille proposes the intriguing concept of\u00a0Tree Signatures, an efficient multisig method with enhanced privacy.\nBlockstream\u00a0was formed by renowned cryptography experts, including some Bitcoin Core developers, to accelerate innovation in digital currencies and implement the sidechain concept described in the paper \u201cEnabling Blockchain Innovations with Pegged Sidechains,\u201d released in October. In November,Blockstream closed a $21 million seed funding round\u00a0with nearly 40\u00a0high-profile investors.\nTree signatures, which can be coded only in the extended Alpha scripting language, can implement M-of-N multisig transactions (which required more than one keyholder to participate) more efficiently than Bitcoin scripting. Wuille shows how to combine Merkle trees and Schnorr signatures to implement large M-of-N multisig schemes:\n\u201cMerkle tree keys support very large 1-of-N. Schnorr signatures support very large M-of-M. This means that if we can write our spending conditions as a 1-of-(N possible M-of-M\u2019s), we can build a Merkle tree consisting of Schnorr combined public keys.\u201d\nAn interesting feature of the new multisig scheme is that only the keys actually used for signing are exposed to the public. For example, in a 1-of-N multisig policy, only one key is revealed on spending and the other keys stay hidden.\nWuille gave a talk titled \u201cKey Tree Signatures: A Mechanism for Very Large, Compact, Efficient Multisig\u201d at the SF Bitcoin Devs Group.\n\u201cIn our first sidechain, Elements Alpha, we introduced several improvements to the cryptography and scripting abilities of Bitcoin,\u201d reads Wuille\u2019s abstract. \u201cIn this talk, I will discuss how some of these features can be used to build an improved multisig construction that is more efficient, compact, and flexible.\u201d\nA video of the talk will soon be posted online. In the meantime, Wuille posted hispresentation slides.\nSidechains are a fundamental innovation because they permit separating the codebase and functionality of a blockchain (sidechain) from its currency. A sidechain can implement all sorts of innovative changes from Bitcoin Core, while still carrying bitcoin as a currency by means of two-way pegs that permit transferring bitcoin to the sidechain and back. Therefore, sidechains permit innovating without threatening the stability of Bitcoin or having to introduce ad-hoc altcoins. Elements Alpha is the first experimental sidechain, and, hopefully, it will be followed by operational sidechains.\nSidechains could put private bitcoin transactions back and adapt to anti-privacy techniques as they are developed. One of the most interesting features in Elements Alpha is\u00a0Confidential Transactions, a cryptographic tool to improve the privacy and security of bitcoin transactions by keeping the amounts transferred visible only to participants in the transaction.\u00a0Richard Gendal Brown, an executive architect for banking innovation at IBM UK, who wrote a simple but excellentexplanation of sidechains, is persuaded that Confidential Transactions are a good step forward.\n\u201cConfidential Transactions are a very clever application of cryptography to hide the value of transactions whilst still allowing them to be fully validated by the network,\u201dwrote\u00a0Gendal Brown. \u201cWithout features like Confidential Transactions (or related technology such as ZeroCoin or ZeroCash), [Bitcoin-like] systems may be unsuitable for those with confidentiality and privacy requirements.\u201d He added that perhaps Confidential Transactions aren\u2019t a full solution, but they are a good start.\nIt\u2019s important to bear in mind that sidechains will be able to operate with bitcoin as a currency only after suitable hooks are implemented in Bitcoin Core, which might encounter some resistance.\u00a0\u00a0A Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) to allow for bitcoin sidechains is in the works.\n\nPhoto by Denise Terry", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 26}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nIt has been little over a week since Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen included Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 101 (BIP 101) into the alternative Bitcoin implementation Bitcoin XT. BIP 101 is designed\u00a0to create a hard fork in the blockchain to allow for blocks of up to 8 megabytes, doubling every two years.\nDespite a major uproar on forums, chat rooms and in the media, not to mention a significant drop in bitcoin\u2019s exchange rate, support among miners is minimal. Bitcoin XT will need 75 percent of newly mined Bitcoin blocks to trigger a maximum block-size increase, but only some 1 percent of new blocks so far\u00a0included\u00a0such a message \u2013 all mined by Slush Pool.\nMoreover, it seems unlikely that the 75 percent threshold will be reached any time soon. A significant chunk of mining pools has\u00a0taken a fierce stand against Bitcoin XT, while others are very hesitant to make such a switch.\nFurthermore, a rapidly growing amount of hash power is now publicly backing BIP 100, the proposal by Jeff Garzik that grants miners the right to vote the block-size limit up or down. Both F2Pool and BTCChina, as well as several smaller pools, have come out in support of BIP 100 in the past few days.\nBelow is an overview of all known mining pools that had at least 1 percent ofhashing power\u00a0on the Bitcoin network over the past week, and their stance on the block-size issue.\nF2Pool (~21%): BIP 100 / 8MB\nThe mining pool that is perhaps most outspoken against Bitcoin XT is also the one representing the largest amount\u00a0of hashing power on the Bitcoin network: 21 percent. Instead of BIP 101, F2Pool currently supports BIP 100, which, of course, makes it the biggest mining pool to do so.\nSpeaking to\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine, F2Pool administrator Wang Chun explained that the Chinese mining pool is open to other suggestions on raising the block size as well. Chun does maintain, however, that consensus among the Core development team is a requirement, and made it abundantly clear that switching to Bitcoin XT is not an option at all.\n\u201cWe do support big blocks if it is implemented in Bitcoin Core. But we believe the whole \u2018Bitcoin\u2019 XT thing is manipulation,\u201d Chun said. \u201cWhile the question whether and how to increase the block-size limit is a technical one, the Bitcoin Core and \u2018Bitcoin\u2019 XT issue is political. By introducing \u2018Bitcoin\u2019 XT, Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn are splitting the community. Totalitarianism and dictators cannot co-exist with the\u00a0free and open-source software\u00a0spirit.\u201d\nChun\u2019s opposition wasn\u2019t subtle.\n\u201cBoycott \u2018Bitcoin\u2019 XT. Bitcoin Core forever. Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn should resign,\u201d he said.\nEarlier this year, F2Pool\u00a0agreed\u00a0on a block-size limit increase to 8 megabytes, in accordance with other Chinese mining pools. This did not, however, include a doubling of the block-size limit every other year, as implemented in BIP 101 and Bitcoin XT.\nAntPool (~18%): 8MB\nAntPool, the second-largest ming pool on the Bitcoin network with 18 percent of hashing power, is also part of the conglomerate of Chinese mining pools that proposed a raise of the block-size limit to 8 megabytes in June of this year. Additionally, AntPool includes a message in support for an 8 megabyte limit in their blocks. As opposed to messages that trigger a switch in Bitcoin XT, however, the message merely broadcasts an opinion. Whether the message should be interpreted as support for BIP 101, which apart from a bump to 8 megabytes is also set to double the limit every two years, is not entirely clear.\nAntPool does seem a bit more willing to potentially make a switch to Bitcoin XT in the future, compared to most other mining pools. Somewhat confusingly, CEO of AntPool\u2019s mother company Bitmain, Jihan Wu,\u00a0tweeted\u00a0that AntPool is willing to make a switch to Bitcoin XT if \u201ca majority\u201d has switched. It is unclear, however, exactly what majority Wu was referring to.\nSpeaking to\u00a0CoinTelegraph\u00a0in June, AntPool indicated support for bigger blocks as well, although the pool also voiced concern about a contentious hard fork:\n\u201cWe like the idea of increasing the maximum block size, but if Bitcoin XT is too contentious, we also don\u2019t want the community to be divided. Doubling the block size every two years may be too arbitrary, we\u2019d like to see the block size grow according to the real needs of the network.\u201d\nBitcoin Magazine\u00a0reached out to AntPool, but received no response at time of publication.\u00a0\nBitFury (~14%): BIP 100\nUpdate:\u00a0As of August 26, 2015, Bitfury has begun voting for BIP 100.\nBitFury is the biggest non-Chinese mining pool on the Bitcoin network, with 14 percent of hashing power. While the pool supports an increase of the block-size limit as well, it is currently not prepared to run Bitcoin XT and vote for bigger blocks. Despite a conservative approach, however, BitFury does not completely exclude the possibility of switching to Bitcoin XT at some point in the future \u2013 but only after careful analysis and consideration.\nBitFury CEO Valery Vavilov told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine: \u201cThe Bitcoin Blockchain is not an amateur project anymore \u2013 it is becoming a platform for the Global Economy of Things. Changing the base rules can affect a lot of things, thus, any changes should be done very carefully, gradually, and with tests.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThe proposed transition to the alternative client raises some concerns about its security: It is well known that key parts of the default Bitcoin Core client were thoroughly checked and sometimes formally verified, which cannot be said about alternative clients \u2013 including Bitcoin XT.\u201d\nBTCChina (~13%): BIP 100 / 8MB\nBTCChina is part of the conglomerate of Chinese mining pools that proposed a raise of the block-size limit to 8 megabytes in June of this year as well. Since today, moreover, BTCChina has started to sign their blocks in support of BIP 100.\nSpeaking to\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine,\u00a0BTCChina\u2019s Mikael Wang made it clear that his mining pool is not prepared to make a switch to Bitcoin XT. The Chinese pool that contributes 13 percent of hashing power to the network maintains that a consensus should be found among Bitcoin Core developers on how and when to raise the block-size limit.\n\u201cWe will not support Bitcoin XT,\u201d Wang said. \u201cWhat the Bitcoin community needs now is stability and growth, and we will not do anything to jeopardize this further.\u201d\u00a0\nBW Pool (~7%): 8MB\nBW Pool has not mined any blocks in support of a hard fork switch to BIP 101. The Chinese mining pool that controls 7 percent of all hashing power on the Bitcoin network does, however, include messages in support of 8 megabytes in their blocks. Additionally, BW Pool was also part of the conglomerate of Chinese mining pools that agreed to an 8-megabyte maximum block-size limit in June of this year.\nWhether BW Pool\u2019s support for an increase to 8-megabyte blocks includes support for a doubling every other year, as programmed into BIP 101, remains unclear.\nBitcoin Magazine\u00a0has not been able to reach BW Pool for comment.\nEligius (~5%)\nU.S.-based Eligius, accounting for 5 percent of hashing power on the Bitcoin network, is another fierce opponent of Bitcoin XT and has no plans to make a switch. Much like F2Pool, Eligius\u2019 owner who goes by the pseudonym \u201cwizkid057\u201d does not even consider Bitcoin XT a Bitcoin implementation \u2013 rather an altcoin.\nSpeaking to\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine, wizkid057 said, \u201cI see no reason to mine yet another altcoin: \u2018Bitcoin XT\u2019 is not Bitcoin.\u201d\nWizkid057 does agree that the block-size limit should be raised at some point, somehow, but said he prefers a careful approach, and contends that such a step should be taken only when widespread consensus is reached.\n\u201cSomething should \u2013 and will \u2013 be done about the block-size limit eventually, but based on real-world data,\u201d Wizkid057 said. \u201cIt is definitely not a dire thing to try to force people into today. When a technically sound solution gets at least the most basic of consensus from users, developers, experts, miners and services, then I\u2019ll consider moving in that direction. At this time I see nothing that fits the bill.\u201d\u00a0\nKnCMiner (~5%): BIP 101\nSweden-based KnCMiner \u2013 controlling 5 percent of hashing power \u2013 is in favor of raising the block-size limit, and endorses BIP 101 in particular. Through a\u00a0lettersigned by seven of Bitcoin\u2019s leading companies \u2013 including KnCMiner \u2013 CEO Sam Cole has expressed his support for the implementation of bigger blocks on the Bitcoin network. The letter did not explicitly state that this would entail running Bitcoin XT, but it did indicate that KnCMiner will run software in support of bigger blocks by December of this year.\nEarlier this year, expressing his support for bigger blocks, Cole told\u00a0CoinTelegraph: \u201cWe would like to see millions of people using bitcoin. To do that we need transaction fees that everyone can afford and is willing to pay. Putting it simply, that means many more paying transactions in each block, not less paying a higher fee.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cIf bitcoin transactions end up costing the same as regular transfers then most of the world won\u2019t see any advantages at all. Add to the fact that MasterCard\u2019s main argument against bitcoin is the seven transactions per second limit \u2026 The sooner we fix it the better.\u201d\nKnCMiner has so far not mined any blocks that would trigger a raise of the block-size limit in Bitcoin XT.\nBitcoin Magazine\u00a0reached out to KnCMiner, but received no response at time of publication.\nSlush (~5%): optional\nThe only mining pool that has come out in support of Bitcoin XT so far is Slush Pool, controlling 5 percent of hashing power. While the Czech-based mining pool does not automatically sign new blocks in support of a block-size increase, it does allow its users to choose to do so individually. Currently, some 10 percent of hashing power on Slush is devoted to mining blocks in support of Bitcoin XT, and these numbers are slowly growing. Additionally, Slush is working to inform miners connected to its pool on the pro\u2019s and cons of Bitcoin XT.\nSpeaking to\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine, Slush Pool operator Marek \u201cslush\u201d Palatinus said: \u201cAt this moment we\u2019re preparing some online materials and articles to explain for our users what exactly BIP 101 is and why they should vote for or vote against this proposal.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThe hash-rate is rising, and I expect more to come after we publish our articles on the topic. I see there\u2019s lot of misunderstanding and fears about a hard fork, but I\u2019m sure Bitcoin will resolve it smoothly in any way \u2013 even if we\u2019ll continue with 1 megabyte blocks or switch to BIP 101 on the first day of 2016.\u201d\n21 Inc. (~4%): 8MB\n21 Inc, which controls 4 percent of hashing power on the Bitcoin network, has not been mining blocks in favor of a hard fork switch to Bitcoin XT. However, the American mining pool that\u00a0received\u00a0a record investment for the Bitcoin industry worth $116 million earlier this year, has been mining blocks supporting an increase to 8 megabytes. Whether this includes support for a yearly growing block size as included in BIP 101 remains unclear.\nBitcoin Magazine\u00a0reached out to 21 Inc., but received no response at time of publication.\n\u00a0Telco 214 (~2%)\u00a0\nBitcoin Magazine\u00a0has not been able to reach Telco 2014, which controls 2 percent of hashing power on the Bitcoin network.

The efforts of these companies are beginning to pay off, as India has seen a gradual increase in the number of developers and freelancers in the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\u201cThere is lot of interest from freelancers in India who suddenly are now getting bitcoins from U.S.-based companies, and then they scramble to understand what is bitcoin,\u201d Indian Bitcoin startup Blockonomics founder Shiva Sitamraju told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine.\nThe increase of Indian freelancers\u2019 and developers\u2019 involvement with Bitcoin startups and organizations has created an efficient environment for local people to buy and purchase bitcoins instantly.\n\u201cFrom publicly available sources that display data transparently, like LocalBitcoins and Coinsecure, we see about $4 million-$5 million USD moving in bitcoin in India every month. Apart from that, the forums see few 100 BTC being traded as well,\u201d India\u2019s prominent Coinsecure founder Benson Samuel explained.\nBarriers Toward Adoption\nIndians are\u00a0skeptical toward new technologies. It took years for the Internet and smartphones to take off in the country, and it may take even longer for bitcoin to reach mainstream adoption in India.\nBut, Sitamraju told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine,\u00a0once bitcoin is adopted by a substantial part of the Indian population, it could really explode across the country, especially in rural and underbanked regions.\n\u201cIndians are slow technology adopters, and we are far behind China/U.S. in bitcoin adoption. \u2026 [O]nce the early adopters/risk [takers] adopt it and enough user-centric applications [sprout]\u2026 this stuff really explodes in India. Indians are second-biggest users of blockchain.info, and today, we are seeing growing merchant adoption,\u201d said Sitamraju.\nSome of the Indian population\u2019s skepticism towards bitcoin may be due to the Indian government\u2019s\u00a0tight regulations\u00a0and restriction for the finance/banking sector. Currently, fewer than\u00a035.5%\u00a0of households in India maintain bank accounts, and less than 20 percent of the Indian population owns credit cards or debit cards.\n\u201cMore education and good press coverage is necessary. India has a tightly regulated finance/banking sector and so people/government is a bit weary of new financial instruments,\u201d explained Sitamraju. \u201cIt is important to stress than bitcoin is not evil. Tipping people [in] bitcoin so that they can themselves experience the power of the technology is an easy way. Also if major Internet merchants here accept bitcoin it would be a major driving force, as e-commerce companies like Flipkart, Amazon are now booming in India.\u201d\nBitcoin\u2019s Potential\nThe number of Internet users has been growing at an annual rate of 32 percent, as the cost of smartphones with 3G and 4G data plans and Wi-Fi access have decreased substantially over the last two years. Today, India has more than\u00a0300 million Internet users,\u00a0and the majority are mobile users.\nBecause of widespread smartphone penetration in India, many users have begun using mobile bitcoin applications such as Blockchain.info and Coinsecure. To continue to this trend, extraordinary bitcoin startups such as Blockonomics emerged over the last few months, to ease the use of bitcoin for the Indian population.\nBlockonomics is a simplified wallet watcher that allows users to track transactions and balance of many public bitcoin addresses at one place. Through Blockonomics, users can receive instant notifications and quick overview of pending and confirmed transactions in their wallets.\nHowever, \u201cWe are not planning a wallet service, as we believe that the major strength of bitcoin is decentralization and that people should retain control of their own coins,\u201d Sitamraju told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0\u201cWe are planning to be a one-stop destination for managing crypto finances having advanced graphs/analytics and eventually becoming the Mint.com of bitcoin.\u201d\nStartups such as Blockonomics in HackCoin or bitcoin accelerators recently have been focused on creating Bitcoin applications that could provide users with advanced analytics and data about Bitcoin.\n\u00a0\nPhoto via\u00a0Coinsecure", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 26}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin has entered into a new phase of its existence. Prominent developers Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen have made changes to the alternative Bitcoin implementation Bitcoin XT, designed to fork Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain in order to allow for bigger blocks.\nBitcoin users and \u2013 in particular \u2013 miners are, therefore, faced with a choice. Will they support Bitcoin XT and vote for an 8 megabyte block-size limit \u2013 doubling every other year? Or will they stick to Bitcoin Core with 1 megabyte blocks, limiting the Bitcoin network to a maximum of seven transactions per second?\nOr at least that is the choice as it is often presented. In reality, the possibilities are not binary. At the time of publication of this article, two other Core developers have proposed three more Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) to increase the block-size limit, and an even wider spectrum of ideas has been suggested on the development mailing list, forums, chat rooms and other media. This article presents an \u2013 undoubtedly incomplete \u2013 overview of these ideas, categorized in six types of solutions.\nSolution 1:\u00a0No Cap on Block Size\nA first option is a full removal of the block-size limit. Such a cap on the block size, after all, constricts\u00a0the number of transactions on the Bitcoin network, which could become a barrier to adoption or utility at scale.\nSatoshi Nakamoto\u00a0originally\u00a0implemented the block-size limit as a quick fix to avoid denial-of-service (D0S) attacks on the Bitcoin network. But since Bitcoin\u2019s creator\u00a0has gone silent, most of Bitcoin\u2019s developers have come to believe that the block-size limit might actually serve more purposes than just the prevention of DoS attacks. The arguments to keep a block-size limit today are diverse, but can be divided into two main categories.\nFirst, a block-size limit might be needed to avoid centralization of the Bitcoin network, and, in particular, further centralization of mining. Perhaps most importantly, bigger blocks would take longer to propagate to other miners when first found. A longer propagation time should\u00a0lead to a higher\u00a0orphan\u00a0rate, as more miners would be mining on older blocks, while newer blocks are still finding their way through the network. That would, in turn, incentivize miners to join larger miner pools, as they find blocks more often, and therefore don\u2019t need to wait for the propagation of new blocks as often.\nSecond, facing a diminishing block reward, and barring\u00a0radical alternative solutions, scarcity in the blocks might actually be needed to secure a long-term income for bitcoin miners. After all, miners effectively sell the space in blocks to fill them with transactions. But if the space in these blocks is not scarce, competing miners could always undercut other miner\u2019s fees in a race to the bottom, until fees reach a near-zero level and miners earn close to nothing to reinvest in hashing power. The end result could be an insecure network.\nSolution 2: A Fixed Cap on Block Size\nThe simplest and current solution to solve this problem is the implementation of a fixed cap; a block-size limit set by Bitcoin\u2019s core development team and embedded in the Bitcoin protocol. This fixed cap is currently still 1 megabyte, as set by Satoshi Nakamoto, but is slowly coming within reach as the number of transactions on the Bitcoin network continues to increase.\nIn order to prevent blocks from filling up, several other limits have been proposed. As a last-ditch effort before shifting his efforts to Bitcoin XT, Andresen suggested raising the block-size limit to 20 megabytes\u2013 although this was never formalized into a BIP. A conglomerate of Chinese mining pools later indicated that 20 megabytes might be problematic, as \u201cthe great firewall of China\u201d could limit the propagation of Bitcoin blocks over the network, and instead proposed a\u00a0compromise\u00a0to 8 megabytes. And since consensus was still not reached, Core developer Jeff Garzik recently submitted\u00a0BIP102\u00a0to double the maximum block size to 2 megabytes in order to buy time to come up with better solutions. Naturally, every other size could be picked as a possible limit as well, whether it\u2019s 4 megabytes or 400 gigabytes, or even a decrease in size as Core developer Luke Dashjr\u00a0suggested.\nA slight variation to this idea, as recently\u00a0proposed\u00a0by Core developer Sergio Lerner, is to hold onto the 1 megabyte limit, but speed up the block interval. If 1 megabyte blocks are found every five minutes instead of 10, that would allow for double the amount of transactions on the network while also decreasing\u00a0confirmation times.\nSolution 3: A Growing Cap\nArguably the biggest problem with a fixed cap \u2013 any fixed cap \u2013 is that it is hard to change. A change of the block-size limit requires a hard fork, meaning all users need to make the switch in order to not be left behind on the old blockchain. This is no easy feat on a decentralized network, especially if different participants of that network vary in their preferences. Furthermore, since the number of transactions on the Bitcoin network is optimistically expected to keep rising, while the cost of bandwidth and hardware is optimistically expected to keep falling, it is broadly assumed that the block size should grow over time.\nThis is why Andresen proposed\u00a0a growing block-size limit. Based on\u00a0Moore\u2019s Law\u00a0and\u00a0Nielsen\u2019s Law, his first public suggestion was to automatically increase the limit by 50 percent per year, which he later readjusted to 41 percent per year \u2013 or 100 percent per two years. Combined with an initial bump to 8 megabytes (a number picked in accordance with Chinese mining pools), he formalized this proposal in\u00a0BIP101. Since it was not adopted by the Bitcoin Core development team, Andresen has programmed BIP101 into Bitcoin XT, to be triggered once 75 percent of hashing power has expressed support.\nAnother Core developer, Pieter Wuille, thinks Andresen\u2019s preferred growth rate is much too progressive. Based on\u00a0research\u00a0by Blockstream colleague Rusty Russell, Wuille believes average internet connection speed will not be able to keep up with Andresen\u2019s proposal. Wuille has, therefore, proposed to increase the block size limit by 17.7 percent per year starting in 2017, which he formalized in\u00a0BIP103.\nBut much like the fixed cap, any set growth rate can theoretically be picked. Perhaps Russell\u2019s\u00a0revised\u00a0figures \u2013 he now suggests 30 percent yearly growth should be OK \u2013 will lead to another BIP in the near future?\nSolution 4: A Dynamic Cap\nRegardless of the preferred figures, a set growth rate has its own problems. Most importantly, it typically includes predictions about the future \u2013 and no one can reliably predict the future. The growth of Bitcoin usage has proved to be rather unpredictable over the past years, and historic technological improvement rates defined by Moore\u2019s Law or Nielsen\u2019s Law are in reality not laws at all \u2013 rather, trends.\nThis is why some suggest that Bitcoin might need a dynamic cap instead of a fixed cap or a cap based on a set growth rate. A dynamic block-size limit would, much like the mining difficulty, readjust itself automatically, based on a pre-defined rule set. And again, there have been multiple ideas on how to define this rule set.\nAnother of Andresen\u2019s\u00a0suggestions\u00a0is to readjust the block-size limit on the basis of the size of recent blocks. This in itself can be done in multiple ways, and Andresen agreed to take the average size of the last 144 blocks (about a day\u2019s worth), and double it to represent the new limit. If the blocks of the past day were an average of 1 megabyte in size, the limit would automatically be set on 2 megabytes.\nA similar proposal entailed to adjust the maximum block size once a certain threshold is reached. For instance, when a series of blocks would on average reach 90 percent capacity, the block size limit could automatically readjust upward. Or, if a series of blocks would not even reach 50 percent of the maximum allowed block size, the limit could automatically readjust downward.\nBut it\u2019s also possible to use parameters not even directly related to the block size. The block-size limit could, for example, be linked to the total amount of\u00a0fees\u00a0in a block. Or it could be based on the\u00a0mining difficulty, as proposed by Core developer Gregory Maxwell. As long as it\u2019s an internal parameter, Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit can be tied to it.\nSolution 5: A\u00a0Cap Chosen Through Voting\nAlmost all interesting dynamic cap suggestions, however, seem to have one common weakness: The data that informs the new dynamic cap on\u00a0the block-size limit can often be manipulated. For instance, miners could send transactions to themselves in order to fill up blocks or to increase fees.\nTherefore, a\u00a0more transparent solution could be a direct vote, possibly on some kind of regular interval. This solution begs another question: Who gets to vote? An obvious option would be to allow all Bitcoin users a vote. But unfortunately, it\u2019s not really possible to determine who Bitcoin\u2019s users are, while it\u2019s easy to game elections by posing as multiple entities.\nHowever, it is possible to vote with bitcoin. This could easily be done by setting up burn-addresses as voting booths. Anyone could partake in the elections, though it would cost money to do so, as the bitcoin used to vote would be lost forever. This way, the side of the debate that is prepared to spend most bitcoin on its desired solution wins. Elections would literally, and intentionally, be up for sale.\nIt\u2019s also possible to organize a one-bitcoin-one-vote election without the need to burn bitcoin. As\u00a0endorsed\u00a0by Core developer Peter Todd, bitcoin holders could vote on the block size with the bitcoin they control, meaning the biggest stakeholders in the Bitcoin economy would have most of the influence on the block-size limit.\nAnd lastly, of course, there is the voting method that is already used to determine consensus within the Bitcoin network: hashing power. Hashing power currently gets to determine what the longest chain is, and it also could be used to vote on the block-size limit. This idea was formalized by Core developer Jeff Garzik in\u00a0BIP100. BIP100 transfers the power to set the block-size limit from the Core development team to the Bitcoin miners by allowing miners to include a message into freshly mined blocks indicating they want to mine bigger \u2013 or smaller \u2013 blocks. If 90 percent of hashing power endorses either bigger or smaller blocks, the block-size limit will double or halve each 90 days.\nAs a possible downside of BIP100, miners \u2013 and especially large mining pools \u2013 would of course gain even more power over the network than what they have today. But at least it would be transparent.\nSolution 6: Extension Blocks\nA completely different solution is conceived by hashcash inventor and Blockstream CEO Adam Back. In what is perhaps the most advanced idea to date, Back\u00a0proposed\u00a0allowing so-called \u201cextension blocks\u201d on the Bitcoin network. In essence, extension blocks would be an opt-in solution. The 1 megabyte limit could remain intact, while users and miners who\u2019d be willing to handle bigger blocks \u2013 say 10 megabytes in size \u2013 could run software to process these as well. This would introduce a new dimension to Bitcoin usage, as it would essentially create multiple blockchains with the same bitcoin \u2013 the 1 megabyte blockchain would simply be more secure than the 10 megabyte blockchain.\nFurthermore, it would still be possible to accept, store and spend bitcoin on the 10 megabyte blockchain, while running only a full node for the 1 megabyte blockchain \u2013 or even no full node at all. Users could, for instance, run a full node for the 1 megabyte blockchain on which they store the bulk of their money, while using an SPV wallet for the 10 megabyte blockchain for day-to-day payments. Bitcoin would, of course, be transferable from the 10 megabyte to the 1 megabyte blockchain, though the decreased security on the 10 megabyte blockchain would suggest to wait for some extra confirmations before trusting the payment on the 1 megabyte blockchain.\nBonus Solution: Flexible cap\nFinally, flexible caps deserve a mention. While not really a complete solution to the block-size issue as a whole \u2013 some type of limit still needs to be set somehow \u2013 flexible caps could relieve the Bitcoin network from a lot of stress. Separately proposed by mathematician\u00a0Meni Rosenfeld\u00a0and Core developer\u00a0Gregory Maxwell, flexible caps don\u2019t really have a hard limit on the maximum block size, but, instead, penalize miners for producing bigger blocks. As such, a sudden influx of new users, or a surge in transaction volume, would not lead to a severe backlog of transactions that could potentially crash the network. Instead, flexible caps would allow room for growth, while at the same time indicating the limit should be adjusted to improve network performance.\nThe Good News and the Bad News\nThe good news is that the block-size issue is being widely discussed by smart people coming up with inventive solutions. A number of new ideas have been proposed, while it\u2019s also possible to combine different solutions into new proposals. A dynamic cap, for instance, could easily be combined with a voted cap. Or a flexible cap could be attached to a fixed cap. Or an extension block joined with set growth. It\u2019s even possible to mix three or more solutions to construct a completely unique approach. And, who knows, maybe some genius mathematician or programmer will come up with an entirely novel long-term solution for the block-size issue.\nThe bad news, however, is that this long-term solution has probably not yet been conceived; every single possibility so far seems to effectively \u201ckick the can down the road.\u201d All sides of the debate acknowledge that Bitcoin will ultimately need additional scaling solutions built on top of the protocol layer, and possibly a revision of the funding structure to reward miners. Bitcoin is still an experimental work-in-progress, with no clear-cut solutions. In an often heated debate, that is the one thing practically everyone agrees upon.", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 22}

Besides the month-long slide in the Chinese markets, the Dow plummeted from approximately 16,459 on August 21st\u00a0to 15,446 on the 24th.\nWhen the going gets tough, investors have historically flocked toward assets that are considered safer, including cash, gold, and treasury bills. Often times, the asset of choice is gold because it is considered the greatest store of value. However, some think that Bitcoin might one day trump gold as a means of protecting against volatility.\nTim Draper, founding partner of Draper Fisher Jurvetson, a prominent Silicon Valley venture capital fund, believes that bitcoin might one day be the preeminent store of value for investors.\n\u201cWhen bitcoin is mature, I expect people to run to bitcoin the way they do to gold when the market gets scary,\u201d Draper said in an email to\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine.\u201cCurrently, there is not enough usage to make people feel comfortable investing in Bitcoin when they come out of the market. I expect that to change.\u201d\nDraper suggests that currently, bitcoin is far too speculative an investment for it to be a store of value. According to\u00a0Investopedia, a store of value means, \u201cany form of commodity, asset, or money that has value and can be stored and retrieved over time. As long as a currency is relatively stable in its value, money (such as a dollar bill) is the most common and efficient store of value found in an economy.\u201d\nFundamentally, the reason people run to cash when the stock market falls is because they view the small inflation to be a small loss in comparison to what could happen in the stock market. Even more, they run to gold because, as Investopedia says, \u201cthey can be counted on to retain some value in almost any scenario, especially in those cases where the store of value has a finite supply (like gold).\u201d\nFor bitcoin to be considered an efficient store of value, the price of it would need to start rising and stay relatively consistent rather than having significant volatility. Draper explained that the bitcoin ecosystem isn\u2019t in a place, yet, for this to happen.\n\u201cThere will be pressure on Bitcoin pricing as there is supply to sell as miners get more bitcoin, and less demand to buy as the use cases evolve,\u201d Draper explained. In essence, miners need to sell their bitcoin more to pay for electricity than hoarders and users need to buy. This results in a drop in the price.\n\u201cI expect this phenomenon to turn around in about 6 months as use cases become apparent,\u201d Draper went on to say.\nDue to the understood finite supply of bitcoin\u2014there will only ever be 21 million coins released\u2014as usage increases and the supply stays relatively constant, the only place for the price to go is up. As the price goes up, investors will potentially see bitcoin as a functioning store of value, which will perpetuate its value.\n\u00a0\nJacob Donnelly is a full-time product manager and journalist covering finance and bitcoin.

(tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe\u00a0block-size limit debate\u00a0has\u00a0taken a turn\u00a0now that some of Bitcoin\u2019s biggest mining pools are\u00a0publicly\u00a0endorsing BIP 100 (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 100) instead of backing a Bitcoin XT blockchain fork. So far, F2Pool, BTCChina, BitFury, KnCMiner, 21 Inc. and several smaller pools have come out in support of this alternative proposal. Combined, this represents well over half of all hashing power on the Bitcoin network.\nWhile these endorsements are just a show of support, and do not trigger a change of the block-size limit or a blockchain hard fork as Bitcoin XT is programmed to do, the mining endorsements do mandate a closer look at BIP 100.\nWhat is BIP 100?\n\u00a0Over the past weeks most of the attention regarding the block-size issue has gone to BIP 101 and the Bitcoin XT fork, but BIP 100 was really the first BIP to offer a solution for the block-size limit. Drafted and published as a\u00a0PDF\u00a0by Bitcoin Core developer and BitPay employee Jeff Garzik in June, BIP 100 does not set any specific block-size limit or program in any sort of predetermined growth. Instead, Garzik\u2019s proposal \u2013 which does not exist as code quite yet \u2013 allows miners to vote what the limit should be.\nThe intended purpose of BIP 100, as described by Garzik, is to take the power to set the block-size limit away from the Bitcoin developer community and, instead, hand it to the free market. The Core developer does not believe such a responsibility over the Bitcoin protocol belongs to any select group of people, and argues that the only sensible solution would be to let the broader mining community decide.\nIn the BIP 100 draft, Garzik writes:\n\u201cEconomic actors that wish to see the speed limit [block-size limit] at X or Y \u2013 thus dictating the free market \u2013 will lobby the Chief Scientist and other \u2018core\u2019 developers, individually, in private, in public, with carrots, and with sticks. When [the] Bitcoin market cap [grows 10 times] or more, the lobbying [will be] even more intense. Yet there is no single human or commitment on the planet capable of picking a good speed limit.\u201d\nVoting procedure\nWhile the details of the voting process are not set in stone yet, the PDF as well as Garzik\u2019s\u00a0comments\u00a0suggest it works as follows: First, 90 percent of hashing power on the Bitcoin network needs to accept BIP 100 for it to activate. This is a one-time thing that will trigger a hard fork. Once BIP 100 is activated, miners can include a public message in a newly mined block indicating how big (or small) they want the block size limit to be. For every 12,000 blocks (some three months\u2019 worth), the bottom 20 percent of all votes is discarded, after which the minimum is chosen.\nImportantly, however, the block-size limit can be only doubled or halved at most. Thus, if more than 20 percent of blocks vote to\u00a0lower\u00a0the limit, the maximum block size is\u00a0decreased\u00a0to whatever is the lowest suggestion \u2013 apart from the bottom 20 percent. If more than 80 percent votes to\u00a0raise\u00a0the limit, the maximum block size is also raised to the\u00a0lowest\u00a0suggestion \u2013 again disregarding the bottom 20 percent. But miners cannot vote the block-size limit up indefinitely. BIP100 has a hard limit of 32 megabytes, meaning the maximum can be reached in five doublings from 1 megabyte. Whether Garzik\u2019s proposal includes a minimum block-size limit remains unclear for now.\n\u201821% attack\u2019\nWhile relatively simple, some say that the voting procedure as described above has some flaws. (But note that it is not yet completely certain that this is how BIP 100 will actually function.) One issue that was raised on\u00a0Reddit\u00a0is the so-called \u201c21% attack.\u201d This refers to the ability of 21 percent of miners (possibly a single pool) to vote the block-size limit down as much as they want.\nThere is some logic behind Garzik\u2019s rule, however. It is generally believed that bigger blocks are disadvantageous for smaller pools. Most Bitcoin developers worry, therefore, that left to their own devices, big pools could keep voting the limit upward \u2013 indirectly putting smaller pools out of business and further centralizing mining. This is why Garzik proposed the threshold; he believes the block size should be raised only if a supermajority of miners (81 percent) agree. Or put differently: he believes that smaller mining pools representing 21 percent of hashing power should have \u201cveto power\u201d to keep the limit low.\nWhether a \u201c21% attack\u201d is really a feature or a bug, therefore, is a matter of perspective. While \u201cblock-size conservatives\u201d consider it an important restraint on the power of big mining pools, proponents of bigger blocks \u2013 such as\u00a0Mike Hearn\u00a0\u2013 feel that a minority of miners can hold the rest of the network back.\nOne last option that should be mentioned, is probably the reason it has been dubbed a \u201c21% attack\u201d. The voting process could allow any entity controlling more than 20 percent of hashing power to decrease the block size so much that it essentially destroys Bitcoin.\u00a0While this would not be in the self-interest of this entity from a bitcoin-profit maximizing perspective, it does mean the Bitcoin network would be less resilient against outside attacks.\n\u201851% voting attack\u2019\nBut, at the same time, the significance of the \u201c21% attack\u201d (or \u201c21% veto\u201d) has been questioned by Bitcoin developers for wholly different reasons. This is because colluding miners can simply ignore any opposition as long as they control any majority of hashing power.\n\u201cIt would be trivial for any majority of miners to skew the vote,\u201d Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cOnce a group of miners is convinced they control at least 51 percent of hashing power on the network, they could simply refuse to mine on top of any block that doesn\u2019t vote along with them. They can do that in subtle ways, for instance by just discarding \u2013 orphaning \u2013 a subset of blocks, something that naturally happens in the protocol anyways. In reality, therefore, miners controlling 51 percent of hashing power would have complete control over the block size under BIP 100.\u201d\nFurthermore, Todd argued that a miner vote could \u2013 and probably would \u2013 be bought by non-mining entities. Payment processors could, for instance, enter into contracts with pools to vote for bigger blocks. And since this would add overhead costs to the equation \u2013 lawyers need to be paid \u2013 Todd believes it would, again, disadvantage smaller pools, particularly in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nTodd himself offered a solution for this problem:\n\u201cIf we ever get to the point that BIP 100 does get implemented, these contracts should be programmed onto the blockchain. This would both reduce overhead costs for everyone, creating a more level playing field, and make the vote-buying transparent at the same time.\u201d\n32MB Issues\nAnother point of critique on BIP 100 is that the 32-megabyte limit might be too small in the long run. Proponents of a bigger block size in particular \u2013 including Bitcoin XT developers Gavin Andresen and Hearn \u2013 believe this is much too low. If Bitcoin becomes widely used, a 32-megabyte limit is expected to be reached sooner or later, which probably means the block-size debate would need to be held all over again \u2013 not something they look forward to.\nGarzik, on the other hand, believes this upper limit would be a good safety net.\n\u201cThe 32-megabyte limit is a check-and-balance, to ensure that the system does not \u2018go off the rails,'\u201d Garzik said. \u201cIt would require a second user \u2018vote\u2019 \u2013 a second hard fork \u2013 to ensure everybody is on board with the levels of decentralization so far, and comfortable with increasing it further. My personal preference is to remove all upper limits, as the system and the free market will naturally find an equilibrium size based on individual miner choices. The 32-megabyte limit is a compromise.\u201d\nOn the opposite side of the debate, developers who favor a conservative block-size approach worry that the block-size limit could actually be increased much too fast under BIP 100. From the moment of activation, it could take as little as a year and three months to reach the maximum of 32 megabytes. This is much faster than other BIPs would allow, and too fast according to several Core developers.\n\u201cBIP100 is somewhat ambiguous, and perhaps the details are still subject to change, but as-is the text allows for up to four doublings per year,\u201d Bitcoin Core developer Pieter Wuille told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict the future, but the ecosystem should not allow such near-unbounded growth.\u201d\nEconomics\nAnother problem is that BIP 100 might hand over too much economic power to Bitcoin miners. This issue was\u00a0first\u00a0raised\u00a0by Israeli mathematician and Bitcoin expert Meni Rosenfeld, and later\u00a0echoed\u00a0by Hearn.\n\u201cThe Bitcoin economy is composed of several groups, and no single group should be given complete power over the protocol. Miner interests are not completely aligned with those of users and node operators,\u201d Rosenfeld told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cUsers want transactions to be cheap and plentiful, nodes want blocks to be small and manageable, and miners could want either big or small blocks \u2013 whatever maximizes profits. If given the power to vote on the block-size limit, miners are likely to abuse it, disregarding the other groups. In every single market, giving producers the power to artificially limit supply and competition can lead to disastrous consequences, and Bitcoin is no different. \u201d\nGarzik, however, contends that miners will ultimately have an interest to keep Bitcoin users content. The Core developer argues that the mining community would be unwise to abuse its powers, as it would effectively mean that the market would respond. In other words: Users would sell their bitcoin.\n\u201cMiner income is in the long-run aligned with users in a cooperative market relationship, even if short-term counter-incentives exist,\u201d Garzik writes. \u201cUsers signal economically via the market \u2013 or directly via email and social media! \u2013 their views on miner behavior, which must be signaled up front, months in advance of any change. While imperfect, miner voting works; it has been field tested.\u201d\nRosenfeld, however, is not convinced.\n\u201cCommittees and discussions where all groups are represented, though slow and inefficient, are much more likely to result in a decision that is good for the Bitcoin economy as a whole,\u201d Rosenfeld said.", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 28}

Mayer believes that while it offers \u201ca potential solution to this intractable global problem \u2026 (bitcoin) is not currently viewed as such by the majority of the investment community.\nP. Bart Stephens, co-founder and managing partner of Blockchain Capital LLC, believes it is too early in the evolution of Bitcoin for it to be considered a safe haven for investors in times of panic.\n\u201cThe recent drop in global stock prices is being driven by macro-economic factors \u2026\u00a0 namely, the slowing Chinese economy and Chinese policymakers\u2019 quixotic responses to stock market volatility,\u201d he said. \u201cThis puts investors in \u2018risk off\u2019 mode and causes a flight to safety\u201d.\nFurthermore, Stephens argued, at roughly $3 billion, the entire Bitcoin market is about the size of one small cap tech stock and therefore a small amount of selling in the Bitcoin market can cause dramatic moves in price. As a result, \u201cBitcoin is still seen as a high-risk investment,\u201d he said.\nDavid Ripley at digital wallet provider Glidera believes it is difficult to predict how weakening markets might affect the Bitcoin ecosystem: \u201cOn one hand, a downturn may lead individuals to feel they have less money available to obtain an alternative investment such as Bitcoin. On the other hand, some individuals may actually view Bitcoin as a better alternative investment to the traditional economic system, which could be facing challenging times\u201d, he said\nProminent Bitcoin investor Roger Ver believes that the fall in the price of Bitcoin might even be a symptom of improving adoption.\n\u201cI think the price has dropped because people can now spend bitcoins at tens of thousands of locations, but most of the merchants are converting it to their local currency\u201d,\u00a0Ver told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cBitcoin wasn\u2019t (previously) spendable at many places, but more people were just holding it as a speculative instrument.\u201d\nVer\u2019s comments echoed those made by\u00a0Tim Draper of Draper Fisher Jurvetson\u00a0that the bitcoin price was bound to come under short-term pressure as miners get more bitcoin, causing selling pressure and less demand to buy as the use cases evolve.\nStephens agrees that the near-term might see further weakness in the bitcoin price.\n\u201cBitcoin is in a bear market and has been for almost two years. \u2026 More recently this summer, the weakness in the price is due to the\u00a0divisions in the Bitcoin development community\u201d, he said. \u201cMarkets, and this includes bitcoin, dislike uncertainty\u201d.\nHowever, looking further ahead, Stephens is more buoyant.\n\u201cOver the intermediate to long term, we think bitcoin will perform very well, especially in a macro-economic environment characterized by fiat currency wars and currency volatility\u201d, he said.\nDespite the concerns around the short-term outlook, the Bitcoin community appears unanimous in its optimism for the longer-term prospects for the digital currency.\n\u201cEvery time we are reminded of the difficulty of central banks and governments trying to manage currencies, economies or markets, we are reminded of the potential value of an alternative, truly free-market approach to currency and financial transactions,\u201d said Ed Boyle, CEO at payments processing platform Blade Payments.\n\u201cLarge negative stock market swings remind everyone that volatility is not limited to bitcoin,\u201d Boyle continued. \u201cTo the extent that Bitcoin transactions continue to grow as strongly as they have been \u2026 bitcoin itself will become more and more stable and more and more valuable.\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 28}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nMastering Bitcoin\u00a0Author\u00a0Andreas Antonopoulos\u00a0recently gave at\u00a0talk\u00a0at\u00a0Harvard\u2019s i-lab, spending much of his time in front of a small audience describing the various issues with Bitcoin as a brand. He noted many problems with the terminology used in Bitcoin, and he also focused on specific products or services in the Bitcoin space that seem to be doing a disservice to potential users.\nAt one point during the presentation, Antonopoulos turned his attention to\u00a0Bitcoin ATMs, asking the audience how many of them had used one of the machines in the past. While a few people raised their hands, those hands went down when Antonopoulos then asked how many of them enjoyed their experience with the Bitcoin ATM.\nHow Traditional ATMs Work\nTo explain the user experience issues with Bitcoin ATMs, Antonopoulos first talked about the setup of traditional bank ATMs:\n\n\u201cWhen you interact as a person with an ATM, 1. you have a pre-existing relationship with the bank or financial institution; 2. you have a pre-existing balance; 3. your primary objective is to get in, get cash, [and] get out. Twenty seconds is too long. Three clicks is too long.\u201d\n\nIn other words, there is no need for long explanations or user-onboarding with traditional ATMs. Everyone who uses them already has a debit card, and they\u2019ve already interacted with the corresponding bank in the past. The process can be simple because the user already has his or her bank account setup.\nBitcoin ATMs Have Nothing in Common with Traditional ATMs\nAccording to Antonopoulos, many Bitcoin ATM developers have been looking too closely at how traditional bank ATMs work when designing their own machines. He noted that Bitcoin ATMs have \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d in common with the ATMs that are currently used by banks, and he went on to describe the experience an average person has when attempting to use a Bitcoin ATM for the first time:\n\n\u201cThe average user of Bitcoin ATM is someone who has never seen bitcoin before. It is a person who doesn\u2019t understand what bitcoin is, and the ATM is their first introduction to this currency. It is a person who does not have a pre-existing relationship with anyone in the Bitcoin space. It is a person who does not currently have a wallet because they didn\u2019t know they needed one \u2013 because they don\u2019t know what a wallet is (it\u2019s a keychain). And so they walk up to this machine, and this machine has been designed by engineers to simulate the experience of an ATM, even though the experience shares absolutely nothing with the use case we\u2019re putting it to. So you walk up and the ATM tries to give you bitcoin in as few clicks as possible with a minimum amount of interaction. Is that a way to build brand loyalty? Is that a way to build user experience? Is that a way to introduce new users? I mean, it just throws it at you, and you\u2019re not ready for that. But, \u2018Please open your phone and display your QR code.\u2019 Like, what? What\u2019s a QR code?\u201d\n\nIn an effort to solidify the point that Bitcoin ATMs should not be operating in the same manner as traditional bank ATMs, Antonopoulos then went through a long list of questions that a user would likely have while attempting to use a Bitcoin ATM for the first time.\nThe Right Model for a Bitcoin ATM\nAfter describing the problems with currently available Bitcoin ATMs, Antonopoulos explained how he would design such a device:\n\n\u201cIf I was designing a Bitcoin ATM, first of all, I\u2019d put it in bodegas. Secondly, it wouldn\u2019t have a lick of English on it. It\u2019d be all-Spanish because I\u2019m going to really push the remittance model. Thirdly, the first function on the ATM would be \u2018Send money to Mexico City.\u2019 That\u2019s it. Because I want people to use the bitcoin for something. [Fourthly], I\u2019d have a big button on the front that says \u2018Talk to a human.\u2019 I\u2019ve got an Internet-connected device with a forward-facing camera and a tablet screen, and I\u2019m not using it to do video customer service? Are you kidding me?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the device Andreas Antonopoulos is imagining is completely different from a traditional ATM. In addition to the focus on international remittances, Antonopoulos also expanded on the idea that the Bitcoin device needs to teach the user about the peer-to-peer digital cash system:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to interact for fifteen seconds. I want to interact for two hours . . . And it tells me where I can spend [bitcoin]. It gives me suggestions on wallets, and it can send them directly to my phone. It\u2019s building loyalty, brand and experience. That\u2019s not a 15-second interaction.\u201d\n\nThis is a perfect example of how sometimes simply applying the old ways of doing things to Bitcoin will not work. The most impactful innovations in the Bitcoin space have been the ones that created something completely new rather than thinking about how things worked in the past. Developers and entrepreneurs should try to avoid simply replacing the carriage with an automobile. It\u2019s time to get rid of the horse.\n\u00a0\nPhoto\u00a0BTC Keychain\u00a0/\u00a0Flickr (CC)", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 29}

In June, Barclays\u00a0signed a deal\u00a0with Bitcoin company Safello to explore financial applications of the blockchain technology that powers Bitcoin.\nBarclays is not the only bank to express interest in Bitcoin\u2019s technology and launch internal experiments and pilot projects. In fact, as recently reported by\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine, major banks including Citi, UBS, Santander, BNP Paribas, and BBVA are taking serious note of Jenkins\u2019 warning and committing resources to preliminary blockchain studies.\nNow, as reported by\u00a0The Sunday Times, Barclays plans to test the virtual currency, allowing people to make donations to charities in bitcoin. The bank has gone into partnership with a bitcoin exchange and aims to begin the experiment by the end of the year. Derek White, chief design and digital officer at Barclays, said: \u201cBarclays is enabling the bitcoin exchange to help charities accept bitcoin.\u201d\nBarclays has two sites in Notting Hill and Old Street, London, dedicated to researching Bitcoin and blockchain technology, with a combined capacity of 75 staff, and is also operating a blockchain workspace in a revamped warehouse in Whitechapel, east London.\u00a0\u00a0The bank \u201cis inviting start-ups, academics, and the government to work at the space to connect with others that are interested in the Bitcoin and blockchain community,\u201d said White.\nWith this move, Barclays will be the first major bank to help selected customers to receive bitcoin payments directly in their bank accounts, establishing an important precedent. Focusing on charities first seems a very smart decision, which can shield Barclays from the potential regulatory and image problems, giving it time to prove the value of Bitcoin in a context that can\u2019t be easily criticized. It can be expected that, after this first initiative focused on charities, Barclays could consider gradually allowing ordinary business and residential customers to receive bitcoin payments.\nThe Sunday Times\u00a0mentions that a Bitcoin company was included in the trade mission to southeast Asia led by U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron a few weeks ago, which underlines the rising status of Bitcoin in Great Britain.

Whereas the S5 used 60 chips per miner, the Antminer S7 uses 162 of the BM1385 chips. Each S7 will be able to generate upwards of 4,850 GH/s while only needing approximately 0.25 J/GH of power.\nPart of the reason the chip is so much stronger is because the company went away from using standard design flow methods. \u201cFrom the BM1385 onwards, we\u2019ll be using full-custom design flow,\u201d Smith explained. While full-custom design flow is more work intensive and does have a greater margin of error, it results in greater efficiency, which is where profit can be found.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to predict the how long our new chip will take to bring to market, but development on our next chip began almost as soon as this one was completed. Our next chip, the BM1387, will be our second full-custom chip, and our first chip built on a 16-nanometer process node,\u201d Smith said.\nWith each new chip released miners have to weigh their options on whether to upgrade. Smith said that there has been considerable interest in the S7 by current Bitmain miners, in particular because older hardware may become obsolete. \u201cThe inevitable large deployment of S7s will cause network hashrate to rise and some older hardware to be forced offline. More recent hardware like the S5 will still be profitable, but to a lower degree than at present,\u201d Smith said.\n\u2018We\u2019ll continue to make our machines available to Joe Miner \u2026\u2019\nBitmain has deployed a different strategy than other Bitcoin hardware companies has. Other companies have focused their development efforts on creating miners\u00a0for internal use rather than widespread adoption. For example, Bitcoin Shop (BTCS) announced that it would be\u00a0merging with Spondoolies-Tech, which would give BTCS access to Spondoolies\u2019 latest miner\u00a0to give it a competitive advantage. Bitmain, on the other hand, continues to sell its hardware to the general population.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very strong believers in keeping Bitcoin decentralized. Until recently, most mining was done by so-called average users and not by large mining operations,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt would be a real shame to see this dedicated group left without options for supporting the network in their own way, and perhaps even present a dangerous situation for the network to be secured only by large and well-capitalized firms.\u201d\nAs mining does continue to get more expensive, only those companies that have the resources to create large operations will be able to survive. The fewer operations that are mining, the more likely it is that one, single source could take a majority of the hashrate, creating potential security problems.\n\u201cWe will continue to make our machines available to Joe Miner for as long as we are making hardware,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s an unfortunate situation that we\u2019re the only big ASIC manufacturer selling directly to consumers right now; we\u2019d love to see more competition in this space and for the miners themselves to have more options available.\u201d\nJacob Donnelly is a full-time product manager and journalist covering finance and bitcoin.

Today, the company announced the launch of PayPal.Me, a personal, vanity PayPal link that makes it easy to remind people to send you money.\nThe idea behind the peer-to-payment service is to erase the awkwardness of getting repaid by someone. Instead of having to ask them, a user could just send his or her friend a PayPal.me link and the friend would be able to pay using their own PayPal account. It minimizes the need for conversation about something that could, theoretically, make someone uncomfortable.\nPayPal.me has launched in 18 countries, including the United States, Great Britain, Germany, Australia, Canada, Russia, Turkey, France, Italy, Spain, Poland, Sweden, Belgium, Norway, Denmark, Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland. Payments between two users in the U.K. will be completely free. For U.S. customers, there are no transfer fees when funds are deducted from a bank account or existing PayPal balance.\nAccording to PayPal, there are\u00a0$51 billion in IOUs\u00a0from friends and family due to the hassle in chasing down debts. The company believes PayPal.me will mitigate that problem.\nThe structure of the URL is: paypal.me/username. PayPal has also allowed users to amend how much money they should be receiving from the payer by adding an amount at the end of the URL. For example, if someone owed $40, the URL would be: paypal.me/username/40.\nWhile there are many applications for paying people, such as Square Cash and Google\u2019s Android Pay, PayPal remains the largest payment platform on the Internet; therefore, its barrier of entry for paypal.me is smaller. Because each username is unique, it is likely that new ones will fill up quickly.\nWhile\u00a0PayPal.me\u00a0doesn\u2019t appear to let users transmit bitcoin, the company has had a more favorable approach to the currency than other legacy financial institutions. PayPal announced in September 2014 that it would allow merchants to start accepting bitcoin through its Braintree application through a partnership with Coinbase.

According to the authors, lightning networks would enable Bitcoin scalability, efficient micropayments, and near-instant transactions. The Lightning Network white paper, a work in progress, has recently been\u00a0updated.\n\u201cThe payment network Visa has achieved 47,000 peak transactions per second on its network during the 2013 holidays, and averages hundreds of millions per day,\u201d note the developers in the white paper. \u201cCurrently, Bitcoin supports less than 7 transactions per second with a 1 megabyte block limit.\u201d\nIt seems evident that as long as the transaction rate supported by the Bitcoin network remains that low Bitcoin won\u2019t be able to achieve the global reach of existing payment networks like Visa. That\u2019s the main reason for the current \u2013 and heated \u2013 discussions about raising the block size. In a recent interview with\u00a0MIT Technology Review, Bitcoin Core developer Gavin Andresen\u00a0warned\u00a0that the Bitcoin network might soon become oversaturated, and people might just stop using Bitcoin because transactions would become either unreliable or expensive.\n\u201cLooking at the transaction volume on the Bitcoin network, we need to address it within the next four or five months,\u201d said Andresen. \u201cAs we get closer and closer to the limit, bad things start to happen. Networks close to capacity get congested and unreliable. If you want reliability, you\u2019ll have to start paying higher and higher fees on transactions, and there will be a point where fees get high enough that people stop using Bitcoin.\u201d\nThat\u2019s what prompted Andresen to launch the\u00a0Bitcoin XT\u00a0alternative to Bitcoin Core, with 8 megabyte blocks, which is polarizing the Bitcoin community and could result in a \u201cBItcoin civil war.\u201d But lightning networks could achieve the same scalability and sustainability without requiring dramatic modifications to Bitcoin Core.\n\u201cWith a network of instantly confirmed micropayment channels whose payments are encumbered by timelocks and hashlock outputs, Bitcoin can scale to billions of users,\u201d note the developers in the white paper. In\u00a0a presentation at the SF Bitcoin Devs Seminar, Poon and Dryja\u00a0argued\u00a0that lightning networks could make Bitcoin capable of processing billions of transactions per day and handling the volume of all global electronic payments on a single blockchain without custodial risk of theft.\nThe implementation of lightning networks would require appropriate tweaks to Bitcoin core.\u00a0\u00a0A soft fork, described in Appendix A of the white paper, has been proposed to enable near-infinite scalability.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTo mitigate malleability, it is necessary to make a soft-fork change to bitcoin,\u201d note Poon and Dryja. \u201cOlder clients would still work, but miners would need to update. Bitcoin has had several soft forks in the past, including pay-to-script-hash (P2SH).\u201d\nImplementing the malleability soft fork will take time, but in the meantime developers are beginning to build stand-alone implementations of lightning networks for development and testing. In May, Blockstream\u00a0hired\u00a0developer\u00a0Rusty Russell\u00a0to work on lightning networks.\n\u201c[W]e can have a network of arbitrarily complicated transactions, such that they aren\u2019t on the blockchain (and thus are fast, cheap and extremely scalable), but at every point are ready to be dropped onto the blockchain for resolution if there\u2019s a problem,\u201d said Russell. \u201cThis is genuinely revolutionary.\u201d\nIn August, developer Mats Jerratsch launched a preliminary, simplified lightning network implementation dubbed \u201cThunder Network.\u201d Jerratsch\u2019s implementation, written in Java and available as open source code\u00a0on Github, is less watertight than the full Lightning Network proposal, but doesn\u2019t require a fork and can be used now as it is.\n\u201cThe initial proposal of the lightning network required some new features, that required at least a [soft fork], pushing any real implementation many months or even years into the future,\u201d notes Jerratsch. \u201cI, therefore, changed the channel design of the initial paper such that it can be implemented with the tools currently available in bitcoin. While such a channel does no longer work in a completely trustless manner, it is a good trade-off to start implementing LN. Most importantly, it allows deployment of software using something similar to the future LN implementations for now.\u201d\n\u201cI think there is a lot to be done, before LN (or similar) is even remotely useful,\u201d said Jerratsch in a Reddit discussion. \u201cMy main goal is to start the process of implementing these changes, such that we may experience LN anywhere soon.\u201d Jerratsch added that lightning networks won\u2019t arrive in time to make any difference in the block size debate.", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 1}

Signers of this letter represent about\u00a090% of the commits in the last year or two to Bitcoin Core, according to Greg Maxwell.\nAs active contributors to Bitcoin, we share this letter to communicate our plan of action related to technical consensus and Bitcoin scalability.\nBitcoin is many things to many people. However, the development and maintenance of Bitcoin is a human endeavor. Satoshi sought review and cooperation, and the subsequent work by Bitcoin\u2019s developers has made the system more secure and orders of magnitude faster. The Bitcoin developer community is dedicated to the future of Bitcoin, looks after the health of the network, strives for the highest standards of performance, and works to keep Bitcoin secure on behalf of everyone.\nWe\u2019re committed to Bitcoin and responsive to the needs of the community. For the past five years, we\u2019ve written code and managed over\u00a050 Bitcoin releases\u00a0and reviewed more than\u00a045 formal proposals\u00a0to improve Bitcoin\u2019s performance, security, and scalability. Technical discussions, while heated at times, are always focused on improving Bitcoin.\nMuch work has already been done in this area, from substantial improvements in CPU bottlenecks, memory usage, network efficiency, and initial block download times, to algorithmic scaling in general. However, a number of key challenges still remain, each with many significant considerations and tradeoffs to evaluate. We have worked on Bitcoin scaling for years while safeguarding the network\u2019s core features of decentralization, security, and permissionless innovation. We\u2019re committed to ensuring the largest possible number of users benefit from Bitcoin, without eroding these fundamental values.\nThere will be controversy from time to time, but Bitcoin is a security-critical system with billions of dollars of users\u2019 assets that a mistake could compromise. To mitigate potential existential risks, it behooves us all to take the time to evaluate proposals that have been put forward and agree on the best solutions via the consensus-building process.\nIn the upcoming months, two open workshops will bring the community together to explore these issues. The first\u00a0Scaling Bitcoin workshop\u00a0will be in Montreal on September 12-13. The second workshop is planned for December 6-7 and will be hosted in Hong Kong to be more inclusive of Bitcoin\u2019s global user base.\nWe ask the community to not prejudge and instead work collaboratively to reach the best outcome through the existing process and the supporting workshops. It\u2019s great to already\u00a0see broad excitement for the event and the high concentration of technical participants attending.\nWe\u2019re confident that by working together we can agree on the best course of action. We believe this is the way forward and reinforces the existing review process that has served the Bitcoin development community (and Bitcoin in general) well to date.\nWe welcome your participation as we continue our efforts to bring Bitcoin into the future.\nSigned,\nWladimir J. van der Laan\nPieter Wuille\nCory Fields\nLuke Dashjr\nJonas Schnelli\nJorge Tim\u00f3n\nGreg Maxwell\nEric Voskuil\nAmir Taaki\nDave Collins\nMichael Ford\nPeter Todd\nPhillip Mienk\nSuhas Daftuar\nR E Broadley\nEric Lombrozo\nDaniel Kraft\nChris Moore\nAlex Morcos\ndexX7\nWarren Togami\nMark Friedenbach\nRoss Nicoll\nPavel Jan\u00edk\nJosh Lehan\nAndrew Poelstra\nChristian Decker\nBryan Bishop\nBenedict Chan\n\u0e3ftcDrak\nCharlie Lee\nJeremy Rubin\n\u00a0\nIf you\u2019d like to express your support of this letter, please sign the\u00a0petition on Change.org.\n\u00a0\nPhoto\u00a0Kim Piper Werker\u00a0/\u00a0Flickr (CC)", "year": 2015, "month": 9, "day": 1}

On August 15, core developer Mike Hearn announced the launch of the\nBitcoin XT hard fork, in a Medium blog post. In his post, Hearn asks, \u201cWhy can\nthis dispute not be resolved in some more civilized manner than an outright\nsplit?\u201c His conclusion? \u201cPut simply, the decision-making process in Bitcoin\nCore has broken.\u201d The Scaling Bitcoin workshops appear to be poised to address\nthis specific dilemma.\n\u00a0\nOn September 12 and 13, the first of two Bitcoin scalability\nworkshops will be held in Montreal, Canada.

In\nfact, the first workshop in Montreal will not be hosting sessions on the topic\nof any specific proposals involving changes to the Bitcoin protocol. It is\nintended to set the stage for phase two in Hong Kong where participants will\nshare results from experiments performed as a result of phase 1 and discuss new\ndevelopments.\n\u00a0\nThe Bitcoin Scalability workshop\u2019s commitment to openness,\ninclusion and transparency is evident in their attendance models. Early bird\ntickets are priced at $150 USD until September 3, but interested participants\nwho are unable to travel to Montreal are invited to watch the livestream via\nIRC. Presenters also have the option of applying for a limited number of travel\nsubsidies.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is not a bunch of people at a closed-door meeting,\u201d\nRubin emphasized. He acknowledged that while in-person, face-to-face\nconversation is the most effective way to share information, it\u2019s not always\npracticable. But organizers are trying to remove as many barriers to\nparticipation and inclusion as possible.\n\u00a0\nWhile there are opportunities to support the workshop\nthrough sponsorship or by becoming an event underwriter, Togami stressed\nanother vital way that companies can support the workshop\u2019s aims: Send us your best engineers.\n\u00a0\nProposals for presentations can be submitted until September\n12, 2015. The committee encourages prospective participants to post a paper,\nsimulation results and source code or \u201cwhatever other type of research material\u201d\nthey have.

The closing date is September 23, 2015. UBS is offering the regional and global finalists cash prizes and accelerator places worth more than $300,000 USD and more than 300 hours of dedicated coaching from UBS mentors and partners.\n\u201cWe recognize there is a lot we can learn from entrepreneurs and startups,\u201d says Bussman. \u201cHence why we were so pleased to be the first global bank to move into Level39 in London. Ultimately our ambition is to help shape a more open and collaborative financial services industry and to jointly develop new solutions for our clients.\u201d\nThe Future of Finance Challenge is divided in four main categories where technology can transform how the bank works and what it delivers for its clients: Secure Banking, Client Experience, Superior Offering and Banking Efficiency. In order to address these challenges, UBS suggests a long list of innovative approaches and potentially disruptive technologies that might be relevant. The list includes a wide range of currently hot technology buzzwords, including some that are (at this moment) only weakly related to the business of banking, such as immersive virtual reality environments and quantum processing.\nBitcoin Magazine\u00a0readers and Bitcoin companies interested in participating in the UBS Challenge will be especially interested in these technologies mentioned in the UBS call: blockchain applications, blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, data analytics, digital identification, digital marketplaces, digital vault, distributed ledgers, mobile technology, security and privacy verification and smart contracts. It seems likely that, by leveraging these technologies in combination with the others mentioned in the UBS call, participants will be able to come up with innovative ideas and solutions for UBS and the banking industry.", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 13}

Core maintainers and highly influential CEOs alike, like\u00a0Peter Smith of Blockchain\u00a0andSteven Pair of BitPay, have entered the online fray, fueling passion-laden discussions across Reddit, Twitter, Medium, and GitHub.\nMultiple solutions have been proposed to alleviate the block size debate,\u00a0 like 8MB blocks,\u00a0  20MB blocks, and\u00a0 dynamic block size limits, among others. However, Bitcoin XT is gaining traction as a viable solution as it would create a hard fork in the protocol by permanently splitting the blockchain into two different ledgers.This fork will occur if 75% of miners adopt the new patch after January of 2016, and at that time, nodes running outdated versions of the software will not accept the valid larger blocks. One of the chief criticisms leveled at Bitcoin XT is the low threshold for adoption, with many core devs suggesting that 90% or 95% threshold for adoption would optimal. As of August 16th,\u00a07.2% of all nodes\u00a0were running Bitcoin XT, with the count growing steadily.\u00a0Current statistics are available, updated hourly.\nGavin Andresen, Chief Scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, and Mike Hearn, the creator of Bitcoin XT are the chief proponents and the public faces of the patch, actively engaging with those who do not support an increase to the block size limit. Andresen developed the current patch to Bitcoin XT, which implements his\u00a0 BIP101 proposal. Under BIP101, the maximum block size will increase from the current 1MB to 8MB, and will double every 2 years after that until it reaches 8,192MB.\nIn addition to an increased block size limit, Bitcoin XT includes several other changes to Bitcoin Core such as double spend relaying, anti-DOS measures, support for new apps that use partial transactions such as the\u00a0Lighthouse crowdfunding app, and DNS seed changes.\nSince Bitcoin XT is a patch to the current infrastructure, Core users will not be forced to redownload the entire blockchain. It is also important to note that at this time, running Bitcoin XT is equivalent to running Core. Bitcoin XT will create a hard fork from the current Core implementation only if a 75% majority is achieved.\nCritics of Bitcoin XT often point to the inherent technical risks of a hard fork. In addition, many experts, including three out of the five Core developers, believe that an increased block size limit would cause significant problems for bitcoin\u2019s infrastructure down the road. The larger blockchain, they argue, would force certain nodes to shut down as storage space requirements become unfeasible for privately owned nodes. As nodes close due to climbing costs, the network could shrink towards centralization.\n\u201cI strongly urge that we return to the existing collaborative constructive review process that has been used for the last 4 years which is a consensus by design to prevent one rogue person from inserting a backdoor, or lobbying for a favored change on behalf of a special interest group, or working for bad actor\u201d said Bitcoin Core developer Adam Back\u00a0in an email.\nCurrent attempts to debate Bitcoin XT\u2019s feasibility, unfortunately, have been censored in many discussion forums. A single moderator on the Bitcoin subreddit has been caught deleting\u00a0\u201chundreds of, what appear to me, to be perfectly valid comments,\u201d\u00a0according to /u/jratcliff63367, another moderator. Since Bitcoin XT would create an alternative blockchain that\u2019s incompatible with the current bitcoin blockchain, several moderators have called Bitcoin XT an alternative cryptocurrency and removed posts discussing the changes on the Bitcoin subreddit, instructing users to discuss the topic in alternative forums.\nDespite the passionate conflicts, rational heads seem to have prevailed. As core developer Mark Friedenbach\u00a0commented in a post, \u201c[T]he block size limit should be raised, but only in step with what can reasonably be accomplished with engineering improvements to ensure a decentralized, policy neutral network. There are many in this space working to identify criteria for that, and a couple of different proposals for actually raising the limit in a way that would be more sensitive to these issues. All that we ask for is the time for due process, not ultimatums and hostile forks.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPhoto\u00a0Martin Sharman\u00a0/\u00a0Flickr (CC)", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 17}

Whether it\u2019s the plethora of innovative bitcoin startups springing up all over the city, the widespread adoption of the cryptocurrency along Berlin\u2019s high streets, or the vast amount of investment flooding into the German capital, Berlin\u2019s relationship with Bitcoin will be instrumental in shaping its future.\nBerlin startups have been enjoying an unprecedented level of investment. Indeed, \u201cDie Welt\u201d\u00a0 reported that Berlin overtook London in terms of Venture Capital Investment in 2014.\n\nAccording to this report, the German capital enjoyed $2.2 billion in investment compared to London\u2019s $1.5 billion, highlighting Berlin\u2019s increasing suitability for promising startups to gain the funding they need to change the face of Bitcoin.\nRecent political developments in Westminster might further add to Berlin\u2019s appeal, as UK Prime Minister David Cameron\u00a0\u201cwould like to see a ban on certain applications that allow users to send end-to-end encrypted messages to each other over the internet.\u201d\u00a0With catastrophic regulation potentially imminent in London, and\u00a0New York\u2019s BitLicence scaring off more and more Bitcoin companies, Berlin has a great opportunity to establish itself as the Bitcoin epicenter.\nBerlin\u2019s Bitcoin startups cover a wide range of specialities ranging from the use of blockchain to protect creative ownership online, to global P2P lending, to bitcoin mining supercomputers. Companies like\u00a0ascribe.io,\u00a0Bitbond,\u00a0SatoshiPay\u00a0and\u00a0Coynoare using bitcoin technology to find game-changing solutions to traditional problems, while\u00a0BitcoinBrothers\u00a0and\u00a0All4btc\u00a0are improving bitcoins availability and usability on a global scale.\nDrawing its philosophical roots from\u00a0Muhammad Yunus\u2019s\u00a0Grameen Bank,\u00a0Bitbondenables people from around the world to access business funding through the use of Bitcoin technology. With 800,000 EUR in funding, its P2P lending and investment model cuts out the banks, allowing investors to fund promising businesses on the other side of the globe at no cost. The need for bankless investing and lending is thrown into sharp relief in light of the 2 billion adults lacking access to banks, as recently reported by\u00a0CNBC.\u00a0Disintermediation allows access to working capital in the world\u2019s financially underserved region, making lending and borrowing globally accessible.\u00a0Recently, another Berlin-based startup,\u00a0ascribe.io, has been garnering a lot of media attention, along with $2 million USD in seed funding from investors like Earlybird, Digital Currency Group and Freelands Ventures. CEO and Co-founder, Bruce Pon, describes ascribe as \u201ca service for creators to protect their ideas and define how they want their ideas to spread.\u201d With this inventive use of blockchain technology, creators can register, transfer and track their valuable digital creations, allowing them to discover where their work is being used.\nSince the funding round, ascribe has been enjoying a growth rate of 10% per week. Its team of 14 is working toward allowing marketplaces to be built on top of their platform.\nAlso working on innovative blockchain solutions in Berlin are\u00a0Satoshipay, a micropayment service for publishers, and\u00a0Coyno, a user-friendly blockchain bookkeeper. \u00a0Both came through the\u00a0Axel Springer Plug & Play Accelerator\u00a0earlier this year.\nLike ascribe, Satoshipay\u2019s goal is to help monetize content for its creators. Its prototype, which recently won second prize at the\u00a0 Coinbase BitHack, focuses on micropayments that allow content publishers to charge fractions of a cent. Founded by Meinhard Benn in 2014, the Berlin bitcoin startup envisions a world where content creators can monetise their work using nanopayments without scaring away consumers with cumbersome fees or subscriptions.\nCoyno, on the other hand, aims to overcome the implicit tax reporting and bookkeeping difficulties inherent in bitcoin transactions in personal and professional settings. As co-founder\u00a0Erasmus Hagen\u00a0says, \u00a0Coyno provides \u201ca full and secure SaaS Bitcoin bookkeeping solution. Coyno offers easy-to-use wallet analytics and automatic bookkeeping, which enables private Bitcoin users to stay in control of their Bitcoin holdings.\u201d \u00a0\nBitcoin mining startup\u00a0 BitcoinBrothers, founded in 2013 by the Welle siblings, is building better, faster machines to make bitcoin mining cost-effective again. The Berlin-based startup offers mining services using its MSEM bitcoin mining supercomputers at over 6 petahash per second. BitcoinBrothers represents a fascinating new perspective on the scalability of one of Bitcoin\u2019s most controversial topics.\nWhile Greece\u2019s former Minister of Finance Yanis Varoufakis has condemned Germany for its \u201cabsolutely impossible, totally non-viable and toxic\u201d economic plan for Greece, Berlin-based\u00a0All4BTC\u00a0is allowing ordinary Greeks a way out of their fiduciary disaster. Specifically, All4BTC is a personal shopping service, that opens up every online store on the internet to bitcoin. For Greeks who are finding it increasingly difficult to gain access to their savings, All4BTC offers an alternative. Backed by the bitcoin incubator\u00a0 BitcoinsBerlin, the young startup has benefitted from the euro\u2019s recent volatility, as an ever-increasing number of people in eastern and southern Europe turn to bitcoin when they find banks inaccessible.\nBerlin\u2019s attractiveness goes beyond the startup scene, government regulations and investment portfolios however.\u00a0The Federal Association of Bitcoin, with its headquarters in the German capital, represents and fights for the Bitcoin community and Bitcoin businesses in Germany. Beyond that, Bitcoin businesses\u2019 entrepreneurial spirit is merely an expression of the creative influence of the city. \u00a0As\u00a0Jason Fell\u2019s\u00a0insightful remark makes clear: \u201cBerlin\u2019s 3.5 million residents are creating a bright, new history for their city.\u201d Berlin is itself a startup, and its citizens love bitcoin. The truth of this statement can be tasted in the beers of\u00a0Room 77, heard in the\u00a0EpicenterBitcoin\u00a0podcasts, and seen in the eyes of the\u00a0Bitcoin Meetupmembers.", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 14}

Drew is also frequently published and cited for his work on IT and technology-related issues, including virtual currencies, smart contracts, distributed ledger-based technologies, computer data security/breaches, and technology regulation.\nTokyo District Court Judge Masumi Kurachi recently rejected a claim for relief brought by a Kyoto man against the Mt. Gox bankruptcy receiver for bitcoin lost as a result of Mt. Gox\u2019s collapse. In his ruling, Kurachi opined that bitcoin is \u201cnot subject to ownership.\u201d\nThe court ruled that Japanese law allows only for proprietorship of \u201ctangible entities that occupy space and which allow for exclusive control over them.\u201d Since transactions of bitcoin require the involvement of a third party, exclusive control over bitcoins was not possible. Although the ruling seems dangerously misguided, it will likely be relegated to its own specific facts and not govern future disputes over bitcoin ownership.\nWhy This Opinion Seems Dangerous:\nTaking the court\u2019s conclusions about bitcoin at face value could create problematic results. Many assets, including stocks and bonds, transact through third parties. Most large-value transfers occur through the SWIFT network, which itself reduces value to intangible digital information. Many intangible assets such as trademarks, franchises, patents, consumer goodwill and contract rights are recognized as legally protectable assets worldwide. The logic of the recent ruling could potentially disturb long-understood concepts of property law, and drastically alter the legal status of many payment methods.\nThe court\u2019s conclusion seems confused, or based on an improper understanding of bitcoin. Use of bitcoin requires only an Internet connection. Thus, it requires less intermediate infrastructure to use than a credit card. The court also appears to have misunderstood \u201cownership\u201d of bitcoin. Although bitcoin itself may exist as intangible computer code, ownership and control of the private key providing access to a specific wallet functionally establishes exclusive ownership of whatever value is represented by the bitcoin held by that wallet. The court\u2019s conclusions appear to be the result of an improper understanding of bitcoin.\nHowever, as discussed below, the facts here are critical, and probably rescue this decision from having a long-term negative impact, or more widespread application.\nA Digression About Japan\u2019s Legal System\u2026\nJapan has a code-based legal system that differs from America\u2019s common law legal system because courts in code-based legal systems generally cannot act in the absence of a specific applicable law. Prior decisions carry much less weight and generally do not bind judges determining future controversies.\nIn Japan, judges consider precedent to fill gaps or clarify the meaning of statutes, but precedent is generally non-binding.\u00a0 Thus, if a similar claim was brought before a different district judge in Japan, that judge may not be compelled to rule the same way on the same issue.\nBoth systems provide the right to appeal decisions to a higher court. If this opinion is appealed in a timely manner, the higher court will reconsider the arguments and evidence submitted to the district court. Thus the outcome of this case, may be changed.\nThe All-Important \u201cWhy\u201d:\nAlthough the court\u2019s conclusion seems wrong, it likely ruled to uphold the bankruptcy receiver\u2019s power to control the disposition of Mt. Gox\u2019s assets and avoid the need to untangle commingled assets.\nFormer Mt. Gox customers who claim they lost bitcoin can assert claims for recovery through the claims administration and investigation process set up by the Japanese bankruptcy receiver. The claims process, which closed on May 29, 2015, may result in claimants from Mt. Gox\u2019s remaining assets.\nThe lawsuit could be viewed as a collateral attack or \u201cend around\u201d of the claims process, seeking to obtain a better result than would be available by submitting a claim. This sort of gambit is not available in the United States because debtors in bankruptcy liquidating assets through Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code are protected by an automatic stay of litigation pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7362.\u00a0 This stay shuts down litigation against the bankrupt entity and establishes the bankruptcy (generally) as the exclusive means for claimants to recover against the debtor. Japanese bankruptcy law, however, does not provide the same stay unless it is requested by the debtor. The court\u2019s ruling may have been intended to prevent an \u201cend around\u201d to the bankruptcy liquidation claims system.\nEven if the lawsuit was not an attack on the bankruptcy claims process, the court may have dismissed it to avoid tracing and separating commingled bitcoin assets. Recent news from a self-professed insider suggests that Mt. Gox operated a single bank account. Other reports suggest that client wallets previously held on the site were commingled. The claim brought in district court may have required the bankruptcy receiver to attempt to identify specific coins among its commingled assets, which may be burdensome or impossible. The litigant\u2019s request for the return of specific bitcoin, as opposed to cash, may have provided a second reason to deny the claim.\nWhat This Opinion Means for the Future:\nIt is likely that this opinion will be limited to its facts. This was a claim alleging entitlement to bitcoin held by a third party in bankruptcy where specific identifiable assets sought by the claim may not have ever existed, and where relief was available through a bankruptcy claims process.\u00a0 The very specific facts of this case may render the ruling not applicable to future claims regarding bitcoin.\nFurther, another lawsuit regarding bitcoin in Japan is unlikely to present the same facts. Finally, as noted by the\u00a0Japanese\u00a0Times, the presiding judge may have felt constrained because bitcoin is not directly addressed by any existing Japanese law. This suggests that the decision may have been a request to the National Diet of Japan to \u201cfix\u201d this opinion by creating law directly addressing virtual currencies. It remains to be seen whether this opinion will create valid precedent, or later be fixed through legislation.\nConclusion:\nAlthough the headline is sensational, there are reasons to suspect that the opinion issued by Judge Kurachi may be limited to this specific lawsuit. Based on the structure of Japan\u2019s legal system, the precedential value of the decision is limited, so that judges are not bound to the argument when deciding future disputes over ownership of bitcoin. Future cases could easily distinguish this case on its unique facts. Finally, because there is no specific law related to virtual currencies in Japan, the precedential value of this ruling may be mooted by future legislation.\n\u00a0", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 17}
{"title": "A Quantum Theory of Money and Value", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/quantum-theory-money-value-1439938025/", "birthday": "Aug 18, 2015  6:47 PM EST", "date": "2015-08-18 23:47:00", "content": "This is a guest post by David Orrell,\u00a0a mathematician and author of books including Truth or Beauty: Science and the Quest for Order\u00a0(Yale University Press). He is currently working on a book about money.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI do not understand where the backing of bitcoin is coming from. There is no fundamental issue of capabilities of repaying it in anything which is universally acceptable, which is either intrinsic value of the currency or the credit or trust of the individual who is issuing the money, whether it\u2019s a government or an individual.\u201d \u00a0\u2014Alan Greenspan\nIs bitcoin money? To most readers the answer will be a resounding yes, but to many people, including former Federal Reserve Chairman\u00a0Alan Greenspan, the answer is less clear. Indeed, one of the things holding back the adoption of cybercurrencies such as bitcoin is that they do not conform with traditional ideas about money.\nBullionists, for example, argue that money needs to be backed by precious metal \u2013 and bitcoin is not. Chartalists (from the Latin\u00a0charta\u00a0for a record), on the other hand, assert that coins and other money objects are just tokens that the state agrees to accept as payment of things like taxes. Again, bitcoin fails. Most mainstream economists, meanwhile, would ascribe to the view that money has no unique or special qualities, but instead is defined by its roles, e.g. as a medium of exchange. But emerging cybercurrencies do not have much use as a medium of exchange \u2013 at least at first.\nSo how do they become money? The answer to this question is that\u00a0money of any sort has quantum, dualistic properties\u00a0\u2013 analogous to the wave/particle duality of quantum physics \u2013 which allow it to be booted up from the ether.\nAs an example of quantum money, consider a U.S. dollar bill. On the one hand, it is a physical object which can be owned, traded and valued. On the other hand, it represents the\u00a0number one, which is why it says \u201c1\u201d or \u201cone\u201d in fifteen different places. And numbers and things are as different as waves and particles. Numbers live in the abstract, virtual world of mathematics, while things live in the real world. Numbers are exact, while qualities such as perceived value depend on the person and the context. Numbers are hard and fixed, like the particle aspect of matter. Concepts or judgments such as worth or value are fuzzy, like the wave aspect of matter. The tension between these contradictory aspects is what gives money its powerful and paradoxical qualities.\nThe trade of money objects for goods or labor in a market means that those things attain a numerical value as well, namely the price, by contagion, just as the atoms in iron spontaneously align in a magnetic field. Market prices are therefore anemergent property\u00a0of the system, in the sense that they emerge from the use of money objects. Of course, a bitcoin transfer does not resemble the traditional, Newtonian idea of a self-contained object, but then neither does matter when viewed from a quantum perspective \u2013 the real and virtual become blurred.\nMoney objects are unique in that their value is designed to be objectively fixed and stable. For other goods, their values are indeterminate until the moment they are exchanged for money (just as, according to quantum mechanics, the position or momentum of a particle is fundamentally undetermined until it is measured, at which point it \u201cchooses\u201d a value). This special status makes money objects desirable in themselves.\nImplicit to traditional theories is the idea that money has to be backed by some pre-existing quantity, be it real (e.g. metal) or virtual (e.g. the law of the state). It therefore passively inherits its value from outside. But from a quantum perspective, rather than money being backed by something of monetary value, it is the other way round \u2013 market prices emerge dynamically from the use of money. A cybercurrency is supported not by metal or the state, but by something much more distributed and amorphous \u2013 its network of users. A property of networks is that their power expands rapidly with size. The value of a cybercurrency therefore grows in the same way with the size of the network of users, so can initially be near-zero. It is not necessary to begin with an external debt or a source of value, because the two can expand together.\nThis process makes sense only when we see money as a quantum, dualistic phenomenon. Just as bitcoin is revolutionizing money, so we need to update theories of money that were shaped by previous monetary eras of gold standard or state fiat currencies.\n\u00a0\nAdapted from the\u00a0full paper available at SSRN.\u00a0See\u00a0video presentation of related Marshall McLuhan lecture, hosted by transmediale and the Canadian Embassy in Berlin.", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 18}

If you\u2019re ever starting to doubt how much energy you\u2019re putting into the industry, just listen or read some of the things he\u2019s said about it and you\u2019ll feel your excitement rejuvenated.\nA little background on Roszak: He was named one of the \u201cWho\u2019s Who of the crypto-currency world\u201d by\u00a0The Wall Street Journal\u00a0and has been in private equity and venture capital for more than 18 years, investing more than $1 billion of capital in a broad range of industries from startup to IPO. He serves on the boards of BitGive, Blockchain Capital, Chambers of Digital Commerce, Dunvegan Space Systems, Factom, Noble Markets and Romit, among other companies.\nRecently, he founded the Chicago Bitcoin Center, which is an incubator based out of 1871. He acted as a producer of the Bitcoin documentary,\u00a0The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin.\nHow did you get your start in Bitcoin?\nBitcoin originally surfaced on my radar in 2011 when one of my portfolio companies, a social gaming company in Singapore, looked into Bitcoin as a potential payment source. So I read Satoshi [Nakamoto]\u2019s white paper and became intrigued by the potential for Bitcoin\u2019s promise. Having a currency and protocol that was open, secure and decentralized resonated with me whereby finance, industry, government and other centers of gravity can be completely re-engineered. I was also an investor in Zero Knowledge Systems, a privacy software company, which was founded by Austin Hill. Austin is now the CEO of Blockstream, a San Francisco-based blockchain startup. All of these intersections kept pulling me into the rabbit hole \u2013 and I have been digging deeper ever since.\nBitcoin and blockchain-based technologies have the potential to change the world \u2013 from enhancing the plumbing on Wall Street to providing for greater financial inclusion for the unbanked. I was drawn to Bitcoin much like my initial experiences with personal computers, mobile phones and the Internet \u2013 I had this emotional reaction when I realized the ways in which these technologies can be very powerful change agents for innovation. Furthermore, there was this clear opportunity to be on the front end of something really transformative \u2013 on the scale of railroads, automobiles, telephony or the Internet \u2013 that has the potential to make a meaningful impact on society.\nI decided to dedicate my time and energy investing in and building out this ecosystem, and founded Tally Capital as an investment and operating platform. To date, Tally has invested in over two-dozen companies, including BitFury, Blockstream, Bloq, ChangeTip, Factom, MaidSafe, Noble Markets and Romit, amongst others. Beyond investing, I\u2019ve also been active on the boards of two leading non-profits in our industry, the Chamber of Digital Commerce (the first D.C.-based trade association) and BitGive (the first philanthropic organization). There\u2019s a ton of work to do in order to propel this industry forward \u2013 from investment and development to education and advocacy \u2013 we\u2019re just getting started.\nWhere did the name Tally come from?\nTo truly appreciate the potential of Bitcoin, one needs to understand the history of money. The name \u201ctally\u201d is derived from tally sticks, a form of currency initiated by King Henry I around 1100, in medieval England. The system of tally marks consisted of notches cut along the edge of a polished wooden stick (issued by stockbrokers) to signify denominations, and then split in half so each counterparty maintains a receipt of the transaction \u2014 this is analogous to the way in which public and private key technology behaves in Bitcoin.\nOver the course of 726 years, the British Empire was built and financed under the tally stick system, making it one of the most successful forms of currency in history. The Bank of England at its formation attacked the tally stick system as it realized that tallies were outside the power of the money-changers. By 1834, tallies were ordered to be burned by the Bank of England, and in the process the fire went out of control and nearly destroyed Parliament.\nDo you believe the \u201ckiller app\u201d for Bitcoin has already been invented? If so, what is it? If not, what do you think it will be?\nMy sense is that the killer app is upon us. It\u2019ll take some time to surface as we\u2019re still in the initial phase of building out the industry\u2019s underlying infrastructure. Some of the key innovations we have seen thus far include multisig and sidechains. Multisig is in many ways more of a feature like double-knotting your shoelaces, while sidechains are just getting off the ground, albeit have the potential to be incredibly powerful in scaling the blockchain.\nFurthermore, the use case of the killer app will likely not be promoted primarily as Bitcoin-based, as the technology will be leveraged and working in the background. There\u2019s an old adage in business that says, \u201cDon\u2019t sell drills, sell holes.\u201d Consumers and businesses are looking for solutions that leverage this new technology and some of its keystone attributes of security, privacy and decentralization.\nA lot of the key elements needed in developing Bitcoin\u2019s killer app, or our Netscape moment, are already in motion \u2013 including a $1 billion investment run rate, the best and brightest from Wall Street to Silicon Valley jumping into the ecosystem, and household names in financial services like Goldman Sachs, Citibank and UBS, and big tech names like IBM, Samsung and Intel, are now fully engaged. These are all of the right ingredients for innovation and experimentation to flourish.\nAs a venture capitalist, what do you look for when investing? What is the one sector you\u2019re most interested in within Bitcoin?\nBeyond looking at the product, market, team, etc., it used to be innovative in itself to be in Bitcoin; however, now you have to be innovative within Bitcoin. As for key investment themes, some of the areas that are of great interest include: identity, big data/analytics, messaging and bitcoin\u2019s role in the IoT [Internet of Things.]\nIdentity is the standout from my perspective. Think about the issues involved with signatures, voting registration, birth certificates, passports and the like. Being able to create a permissioned identity stack for consumers and businesses with unprecedented levels of security, privacy and control can be very powerful.\nToday, our identity is stored, updated and managed by governments, employers, banks and social networks \u2013 and not a day goes by where this sensitive information doesn\u2019t get compromised. When one goes to a Target, we give them our credit card and sometimes a driver\u2019s license is required to confirm that credit card is indeed ours. These consumer transactions require a lot more personal information than what\u2019s truly necessary.\nIdentity needs to be completely re-imagined. There should be discrete slices of our identity stack that dynamically populates the right information in the appropriate circumstance \u2013 not to mention for a predetermined amount of time. For example, if you\u2019re purchasing alcohol, all that needs to be verified is your age. If you\u2019re headed to a job interview, employers only get a specific set of information. Mortgage application? That\u2019s a different part of the stack. Hospital? Way different.\nThis new blockchain identity model can also turn the entire advertising industry upside down. Consumers will no longer be forced to look at ads, unless we provide express authorization. In return, consumers get compensated directly from advertisers and cut out the middleman (like Facebook and Google). Fast forward this movie further, and you can see how this model can turn high impact advertising into a smart contract residing on the blockchain.\nStrengthening identity and personal privacy protections with blockchain-based technologies is a game-changer, and one of the greatest opportunities in Bitcoin.\nDo you believe that BitLicense will have a significantly negative impact on Bitcoin businesses or will the increased regulation provide some validation for the businesses?\nBitLicense has created clarity as to what it takes to operate in the State of New York, which is a good thing. On the other hand, the processes and requirements to adhere to BitLicense are extremely detrimental to early-stage companies. Many other states and even countries will look to BitLicense as a model regulatory framework, which will only make it harder and more expensive to operate in this industry.\nFrom my perspective, BitLicense is akin to a big boot compressing the air hose of innovation \u2013 and will make entrepreneurs and investors think twice about doing business in New York. This may also lead to jurisdictional arbitrage, and perhaps create new power centers for Bitcoin companies in places like London, Toronto or Singapore, which have shown to be much more accommodating during these early days.\nFred Wilson owns a small amount of bitcoin but, for the most part, is more interested in investing in Bitcoin companies. Are you more focused on the companies, the currency, or a mixture of both?\n\u00a0My investment thesis is comprised of both bitcoin and companies in the ecosystem. The majority of Tally\u2019s capital resides in bitcoin, the currency. I do not check the price of bitcoin every day \u2013 this is a long-haul investment, and my sense is that it will take 5-10 years for things to materialize. To date, Bitcoin has been a speculative flywheel on the currency. Miners sell their bitcoin winnings to help fund electricity bills and next-gen chips, while investors buy and hoard hoping the price goes up. That dynamic has been relatively ho-hum over the recent past as evidenced by the relatively stable, or more like boring, price range of bitcoin. The key in all of this is to have the blockchain\u2019s flywheel get moving with innovative applications that help drive utility, throughput and transactions. Once that happens, the price of bitcoin will react accordingly.\nWhere do you see the price of bitcoin going over the next few years?\n\u00a0I think bitcoin is one of the greatest mispriced assets I\u2019ve seen in my career. I am extremely bullish on bitcoin. Given the investment capital and human capital dynamics pouring into this ecosystem, I believe bitcoin is one of the greatest generational opportunities for investors and entrepreneurs. The easiest way for people to invest in this ecosystem is by simply buying bitcoin \u2013 which I like to characterize as a tracking stock representing this exciting, new frontier in technology, and well beyond.", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 18}

While the dustup over New York\u2019s BitLicense program continues, another front has opened up in California where a member of the state assembly has introduced a bill to regulate California\u2019s digital currencies businesses.\nThe Washington, D.C.-based\u00a0Coin Center\u00a0and the San Francisco-based\u00a0Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)\u00a0each have lobbied hard against the New York Department of Financial Services attempts to regulate New York businesses with its controversial BitLicense program.\nBut with the proposed California law, the two organizations have taken two separate forks in the advocacy road, with Coin Center supporting the California legislation and EFF adamantly opposed.\nCoin Center supports while EFF opposes proposed California law\nCoin Center is now supporting the proposed California legislation, saying it is the best possible compromise under the circumstances and would prevent a worse law \u2013 the current money transmission law \u2013 from being the default in regulating bitcoin.\nPeter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center, told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazinethe proposed California law is a \u201cmodel for sound regulation in this sector,\u201d not as flawed as the New York BitLicense regulations, and is much better than the status quo.\n\u201cA Bitcoin company that actually holds all of the private keys for some user is acting just like a bank or a money transmitter. It\u2019s very difficult to convince politicians that between two companies with very similar risk profiles, one that holds peoples bitcoins and one that holds their fiat, the Bitcoin business should get special treatment,\u201d he said.\n\u201c[T]he losses suffered by customers of Mt. Gox and other failed exchanges provide all the rationale they need to treat bitcoin custodians exactly as they would treat the legacy industry,\u201d Van Valkenburgh said. \u201cSo what we\u2019re left with, the sensible strategy, is to make sure that non-custodial and highly innovative uses of the technology, like multi-sig, sidechains, the lightning network, are exempted.\u201d\nThe proposed law would require digital currencies businesses to obtain a license from the California Department of Business Oversight (DBO).\n\u201cEverybody \u2014 even Coin Center \u2014 acknowledges that this bill has serious flaws,\u201d EFF Activism Director Rainey Reitman told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cBut the biggest problems aren\u2019t for large, established Bitcoin companies like those backing Coin Center. Many of those aren\u2019t affected by this bill, either because they already qualify for a license exception or they have the resources to overcome the regulatory hurdles.\u201d\nWhat happens now?\nThe proposed legislation has passed through the California Assembly (although the vote was split), and through the Senate Banking and Financial Institutions Committee, and is due to be voted on in the California Senate in the near future.\nMeanwhile, Coin Center will work to educate people on how the law will work.\n\u201cCoin Center has been transparent from the start when it comes to bill AB 1326,\u201d Van Valkenburgh said. \u201cWhile the bill began its life unfriendly to Bitcoin and blockchain innovation, it has evolved into a model for sound regulation in this sector, even if it can still be improved.\u201d\nEFF will be fighting the proposed bill through its\u00a0online activism campaign.\nReitman noted the possible repercussions of this law.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this will stop in California. If this bill passes, I suspect it will be replicated in future states, with potentially worse provisions. That\u2019s why this battle is so important,\u201d she said. \u201cOur mission is clear and we will continue to work on behalf of Bitcoin startups, innovators, and users of future virtual currency technologies that may never exist if this law is passed. EFF has to argue for the wider public interest.\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 17}

India has the potential to become one of the largest Bitcoin markets in the world, given the country\u2019s extraordinarily large remittance market, which currently is worth more than\u00a0$50 billion\u00a0USD.\nDespite the growing remittance demands, much of India\u2019s population is underbanked, suffers from poor payment infrastructures and lacks access to traditional financial services.\nWith the help of local bitcoin exchanges such as Bitcoin India and UnoCoin and tech giants such as Microsoft and IBM, many merchants and entrepreneurs are finally shifting toward bitcoin and beginning to recognize its advantages.\n\u201cFrom publicly available sources that diplay data transparently, like LocalBitcoins and Coinsecure, we see about $4 million to $5 million USD moving in Bitcoin in India every month,\u201d Samuel Benson, CEO of Bitcoin India told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cApart from that, the forums see few 100 BTC being traded as well. This is still early days, as a lot of businesses in India in this space are relatively new.\u201d\nBenson added that achieving mainstream Bitcoin adoption in India is not a hard task. He believes that as more Bitcoin startups continue to emerge, more merchants and businesses will turn to bitcoin.\n\u201cBitcoin has to be simplified a lot more for viral growth,\u201d Benson said. \u201cWhen we look at numbers in India which point to the current distribution of payments, wherin 90 percent is cash, 7 percent is via checks and 3 percent is electronic, the cash part of this shows that it is a fairly decentralized system as it is.\u201d\nMaking the switch to Bitcoin is not a tough one for India, he said. \u201cIn order for Bitcoin to quickly reach mass adoption, we need more Bitcoin-related business building up and working on this as a technology that needs to be polished and spread rather than a golden goose.\u201d\nA majority of Indian merchants accept payments on e-commerce platforms such as FlipKart using PayPal or credit cards. PayPal, known for its tendency to freeze payments and its high transaction fees, is extremely inefficient for merchants, especially for those required to pay their suppliers outside of India.\nAs a temporary solution, Bitcoin exchange and wallet service provider Unocoin launched a Bitcoin merchant processing platform, which any merchant can use to accept bitcoin on e-commerce platform sites. The company also has been working with the\u00a0HighKart\u00a0team to develop India\u2019s first bitcoin-only e-commerce site.\u00a0\nUnocoin also has\u00a0partnered\u00a0with eTravelSmart, an online bus ticket booking portal, to allow Indian citizens to purchase bus tickets with bitcoin.\n\u201cThe Bitcoin community in India is maturing, and people started understanding it now,\u201d an eTravelTeam spokesperson told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cI see many bitcoin meetups happening in India. Now we are doing sales around five transactions, worth less than one bitcoin per month. We expect the sales to double month on month in coming days.\u201d\nHackathons and Research\nMicrosoft and IBM have sponsored bitcoin- and blockchain-related hackathons in India. The most recent event was \u201cHackCoin Mumbai,\u201d which was joined by more than a hundred developers looking to build blockchain-based applications for payments, big data and digital experience.\nThe hackathon is sponsored by Microsoft, IBM and Citruspay, and the executives of these companies will participate in the event as mentors and panelists,\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine\u00a0reported\u00a0previously.\n\u201cWe were fortunate to be a part of these events as title sponsors as well. We had given out challenges with Bitcoin-related builds and got many entries from participants,\u201d Benson told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine.\n\u201cThis is heartening, because it is a huge change in the ecosystem compared to what India has been doing with Bitcoin over the past few years,\u201d he said. \u201cLarger companies are exploring the blockchain, and as they understand it better they will turn to Bitcoin as well.

This week, one of the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin services and wallet providers Coinbase became the 25thcompany to file for a BitLicense, which is expected to cost more than $100,000 in legal and compliance fees, according to Bitstamp Executive Vice President and chief legal officer George Frost.\nSince February, Coinbase has continued to work with the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to improve the regulations and restrictions set on digital currencies such as bitcoin. Today, Coinbase is trying to\u00a0engage with NYDFS\u00a0in other states to become a fully licensed bitcoin exchange across the United States.\n\u201cPlenty of attention has been placed on New York, but the BitLicense application process is just one part of a larger multi-state licensing strategy that Coinbase has been executing for nearly two years and at significant expense,\u201d a Coinbase spokesperson told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cOur plan has always been to work with the [NY]DFS, as we have with other states, to get fully licensed and continue to serve consumers, merchants and developers across the U.S.\u201d\nReal Cost\nDepending on the size and nature of the business, the total cost required to become licensed in New York and to be fully compliant with BitLicense varies. The total cost for Bitstamp, the third-largest bitcoin exchange by trading volume, was around $100,000 including all fees, legal costs, and labor. This does not include the ongoing costs of compliance or future filings with the NYDFS.\nIn contrast, medium-sized bitcoin exchange Coinsetter has spent around $50,000, according to Jaron Lukasiewicz, Coinsetter CEO and founder. \u201cI think its bigger cost, though, has been in the uncertainty it created for investors looking to invest in our space \u2013 hopefully that will begin to reverse itself now,\u201d he said.\nAlthough a Coinbase spokesperson declined to disclose the total amount of money the company has spent to comply with the BitLicense, he told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cThe process was a significant undertaking \u2026 and we\u2019re fortunate to have the internal resources and competent team to get this done. Our plan has always been to obtain the licensing required to operate in the state of New York, and we applied for the BitLicense as soon as it had been finalized by the [NY]DFS.\u201d\nCoinbase\u2019s Contribution to BitLicense\nCoinbase\u00a0is one of the companies that submitted comments on initial drafts of the BitLicense to the NYDFS. Feedback from the Bitcoin industry was responsible for many of the changes and improvements made to the initial drafts of the BitLicense.\nIn one of the early versions drafted by the NYDFS, there was significant overlap between existing money transmitter regulations and the provisions of the BitLicense. Coinbase submitted a\u00a0formal response\u00a0to the NYDFS, asking for this duplication to be removed.\nCoinbase said \u201cthe Financial Crimes Enforcement Network put a powerful anti-money laundering policy in place,\u201d and that some of the provisions of the BitLicense could compel licensees to manage proprietary payment networks, thus removing the open protocol attribute of bitcoin. Coinbase said the BitLicense should just apply to businesses that hold funds on behalf of their customers.\nThis marks the start of Coinbase\u2019s ambitious mission to become the first fully compliant bitcoin exchange throughout U.S. The firm has\u00a0secured $75 million\u00a0USD in its latest funding round in January, and plans to allocate a big part of its fund to become licensed in as many states as possible, to keep the title of the largest bitcoin exchange in the country.", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 20}

The method doesn\u2019t require that the two criminal parties trust each other.\nSimilarly, self-executing smart contracts could be used in \u201cassassination markets.\u201d Criminals could place a smart contract for the assassination of a target, and the contract could pay the murderer automatically upon verification (for example by automatically scanning news wires) that the target has been murdered at an agreed place and time. Again, the method doesn\u2019t require that the criminals trust each other.\nThe researchers participate in the\u00a0Initiative for Crypto-Currencies and Contracts(IC3).\n\u201cEmerging smart\u00a0\u00a0contract\u00a0\u00a0systems\u00a0\u00a0over\u00a0\u00a0decentralized\u00a0\u00a0cryptocurrencies\u00a0\u00a0allow\u00a0mutually\u00a0\u00a0distrustful\u00a0\u00a0parties\u00a0\u00a0to\u00a0\u00a0transact safely with each other without trusting a third-party intermediary,\u201d notes a related IC3\u00a0paper.\n\u201cIn some ways this is the perfect vehicle for criminal acts, because it\u2019s meant to create trust in situations where otherwise it\u2019s difficult to achieve,\u201d says Juels.\nEthereum CTO Gavin Wood notes that the aspects of Ethereum that make it suitable for \u201ccriminal smart contracts\u201d can also permit all sorts of positive, radical social changes. For example, Ethereum smart contracts could permit creating decentralized versions of services such as Uber, and handling the payments without the need for a company in the middle. Such decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) systems would be nearly impossible to legislate against.\nEthereum communications officer Ken Kappler made\u00a0similar examples\u00a0of how smart contracts could permit developing P2P versions of services such as eBay and AirBNB, which work without intermediaries. In general, intermediaries have been needed to operate exchange networks where the users don\u2019t necessarily trust each other, but exchange networks built around self-enforcing smart contracts don\u2019t require trust, and therefore don\u2019t require intermediaries.\nTherefore, smart contracts represent a disruptive innovation with a huge potential. In 2001, legendary cryptographer Nick Szabo\u00a0spoke\u00a0of smart contracts that solved the problem of trust by being self-executing, and property embedded with information about who owns it.\u00a0For example, the key to a car might only operate if the car has been paid for according to the terms of a contract.\n\u201cThe potential for Ethereum to alter aspects of society is of significant magnitude,\u201d said Wood. \u201cThis is something that would provide a technical basis for all sorts of social changes, and I find that exciting.\u201d\n\nPhoto\u00a0Tim Pierce\u00a0/\u00a0Flickr (CC)", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 19}

The move was considered as a remarkably bold initiative by a mainstream bank.\nFidor Bank is no stranger to bold, innovative initiatives. The bank, which was granted a full European banking license in 2009, is known as a modern Internet Bank and an early adopter of new trends in fintech with innovative services for connected consumers.\u00a0Fast Company\u00a0named Fidor Bank one of\u00a0the world\u2019s top 10 most innovative companies of 2015 in personal finance, and described it as a social bank that leverages cutting-edge technology to respond to customer wishes.\nA key feature of Fidor Bank is its\u00a0community\u00a0site, where users and representatives of the bank discuss the financial services provided by the bank in an open forum.\u00a0The bank is popular among Bitcoin users and considered as the most Bitcoin-friendly mainstream bank. In October, Fidor Bank\u00a0partnered\u00a0with bitcoin exchange Kraken to create the world\u2019s first\u00a0cryptocurrency bank.\nIn April,\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine\u00a0reported\u00a0that Fidor Bank would begin operations in Great Britain. The move has encountered delays, which have been interpreted as due to opposition of the U.K. banking system, especially from major banks. But in a recent interview published in\u00a0International Business Times, Fidor Bank CEO Matthias Kr\u00f6nerdenied\u00a0those rumors, and stated that the delays haven\u2019t been due to lack of support, but to standard paperwork issues.\nKr\u00f6ner confirmed that Fidor Bank intends to start operating in the U.K. in 2015.\nIn the interview, Kr\u00f6ner spoke frankly about the perhaps unique position of Fidor Bank. Despite the now fashionable statements of interest in blockchain-based fintech that have been issued by many major banks, Fidor Bank remains the only bank to offer bitcoin options to its customers as part of normal banking operations.\n\u201cWe simply think that everything which is coming along with crypto or even bigger with the blockchain is a more or less a natural part of the digital environment or the digital lifestyle,\u201d said Kr\u00f6ner. \u201cIt is, as always, not a good thing to ignore or exclude important parts of a certain lifestyle once your customers are executing this lifestyle.\u201d\nAccording to Kr\u00f6ner, Fidor Bank has operated so far with the full consent of German regulators, some of which are perhaps more amenable to bitcoin than their counterparts in other European countries or in the United States. In particular, Kr\u00f6ner expressed critical views of Bitlicense regulations in New York, and mentioned that\u00a0many Bitcoin operators,\u00a0including Fidor Bank partner Kraken, are leaving New York.\nKr\u00f6ner is not interested in the underground aspects of bitcoin, and he is not impressed with the \u201cfundamentalist\u201d arguments in support of anonymous payments. On the contrary, he is in favor of reasonable and constructive regulations. At the same time, he is persuaded that the biggest obstacle to sound regulations is the fact that the politicians don\u2019t understand cryptocurrencies and the digital environment.", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 18}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nThere are many reasons why someone may become interested in Bitcoin. Some are mesmerized by the technology\u2019s\u00a0pseudonymous creator, while others simply like the idea of having a completely open payment network for the entire globe. Although it\u2019s easy to become captivated by what Bitcoin has to offer, it is difficult for many individuals to fully understand the specific areas of daily life where Bitcoin may be useful.\nCoinbase\u00a0has been one of the main drivers behind the adoption of Bitcoin in the mainstream, and CEO\u00a0Brian Armstrong\u00a0sees three areas where Bitcoin can be most useful right now. For Armstrong, disrupting traditional financial services, bringing digital financial services to people who don\u2019t already have them, and enabling completely new Internet applications are the three areas where the cryptocurrency can be the most useful right now. The Coinbase CEO expanded on these thoughts in a\u00a0recent episode\u00a0of the\u00a0a16z Podcast\u00a0with\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0ColumnistChristopher Mims.\nDisrupting Traditional Financial Services\nArmstrong\u2019s first area of focus when discussing Bitcoin\u2019s usefulness had to do with traditional financial services. Although many Bitcoin businesses have decided to focus on the developing world or industries that operate in a legal gray area, Armstrong also sees value in using Bitcoin to disrupt the financial services that people already use in the developed world:\n\u201cOne of them is . . . distributing traditional financial services and products. In [one] case, remittance. It might allow it to be faster or cheaper, right? Other examples of traditional financial products it might disrupt would be things like credit card payments where now those fees are less, or instead of going to get a loan at a bank, you might be able to get a peer-to-peer loan through something like\u00a0BTCJam, which is a startup out there.\u201d\nBringing Financial Services to the Developing World\nArmstrong\u2019s second area of focus was the developing world where there is more than a bit of cell phone penetration but a lack of access to traditional bank accounts. The\u00a0Coinbase\u00a0CEO believes that Bitcoin can bring financial services to people in the developing world who otherwise would have no access to digital commerce:\n\u201cThe second major category in my mind would be developing world use cases where people don\u2019t actually have financial services today. These are the unbanked of the world, and there\u2019s something like two to three billion people in the world who have a cell phone but do not have a bank account or credit card. So, they\u2019re living, essentially, with cash or they\u2019re using some kind of primitive digital currency \u2014 like a lot of people actually send cell phone minutes or cell phone credit. They can SMS it to each other in the developing world.\u201d\nArmstrong expanded on how something like cell phone minutes could be seen as a precursor to a digital currency such as Bitcoin:\n\u201cThere\u2019s actually some places where you can go in the Philippines and buy dinner with cell phone minutes and things like that. You text it to the person across the counter, and so those are all early precursors of digital currency \u2013 types of digital currency that people are using there. We think that a whole generation of kids and people in the developing world will actually grow up, and their first \u2018bank account\u2019 will actually be a digital currency wallet on their cell phone.\u201d\nEnabling New Internet Applications\n\u00a0Armstrong\u2019s third area of usefulness is perhaps the most interesting. With Bitcoin, certain Internet applications that did not make sense in the past are now possible:\n\u201cThe third one would be what I call brand new Internet applications that are uniquely enabled by Bitcoin. By that I mean it\u2019s not disrupting the traditional financial services industry or something like that. It\u2019s actually creating something [where] the only way it works is with Bitcoin. These are very small today, but I think in the future some of these will end up being multi-billion dollar companies and systems. Some of these are things like distributed crowdfunding, like the\u00a0Lighthouse\u00a0project is an example of that. There are prediction markets\u00a0where you can use the wisdom of crowds to predict the outcome of certain events.\u201d\nArmstrong also explained that many of these new applications made possible through Bitcoin usually have something to do with microtransactions:\n\u201cA lot of them have to do with microtransactions, actually, which is something Bitcoin uniquely enables. So, there are things like tipping on the Internet with things like\u00a0ChangeTip. These are examples of, kind of, very new use cases that are uniquely enabled by Bitcoin, which are not big yet but could actually grow \u2014 more of like a\u00a0greenfields\u00a0idea.\u201d\nWhen you combine these three areas of usefulness for Bitcoin, it\u2019s easy to see why so many people are bullish on the technology\u2019s potential rate of adoption. As Armstrong alluded to later in the conversation, it is these sorts of use cases that attack pain points in people\u2019s financial lives that will drive more adoption over the long term.\nPhoto\u00a0TechCrunch\u00a0/\u00a0Flickr (CC)", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 20}

Just 48\u00a0hours into their crowdsale, which launched at noon\u00a0EST on August 17, they have raised in excess of\u00a04200\u00a0BTC and 549000\u00a0ETH.\n\u201cUnfortunately, the ether and BTC price keep falling, so the buys can\u2019t keep up with the (USD) price,\u201d said Augur\u2019s marketing director, Tony Sakich. Bitcoin has dropped from $253 USD to around the $232 \u00a0mark since the Augur sale began.\nIt\u2019s a remarkable feat for a company that has a somewhat esoteric product, built on Ethereum, arguably an as-yet unproven blockchain platform. Ethereum\u2019s Frontier stage was released just last month, making Augur the first major platform to stake its claim there.\nAugur is an open-source, decentralized prediction market. It uses \u201cthe wisdom of the crowd\u201d to project and confirm the outcome of future events. People set up events and buy shares in the possible outcomes of those events. Once the event is concluded, the funds associated with shares of the correct outcome are distributed among the shareholders, the Augur Foundation, and the \u201coracles\u201d \u2014 people who contributed to verifying the outcome of the event.\n\u201cReputation\u201d (REP) is the token that fuels the network; the more REP a user has, the more value or trust is assigned to that person\u2019s input. After an event occurs, the consensus of Augur \u201coracles\u201d defines its outcome. People who report truthfully earn REP tokens and are also awarded a portion of the winnings. People who report against the consensus (untruthfully) lose REP tokens and earn nothing.\nJeremy Gardner, Augur\u2019s Director of Operations, told \u00a0Bitcoin Magazine\u00a0that the purpose of the Augur token sale is to distribute reputation tokens as widely as possible, not necessarily \u201cto raise tens of millions of dollars,\u201d thereby creating a decentralized and accurate network of oracles.\n\u201cThe point is to create a distributed consensus maintained by reporters all over the world,\u201d said Gardner. \u201cIt has been extraordinary to speak to folks from all over the globe looking to participate in our system. Hundreds of individuals have already bought in, guaranteeing a robust, global consensus network. Whether we raise a million dollars or 10, what we want is thousands of unique participants, each willing to help maintain this truly revolutionary system.\u201d\nThus far, the distribution of Augur accounts seems to be meeting that goal. More than 2,400 accounts have been created on the Augur crowdsale site with approximately 1,000 users already buying in. The global distribution of those accounts, according to Augur\u2019s data, is widespread, although higher concentrations of activity seem to be in the United States, along with Brazil, Italy, China, and Japan.\n\nDistribution of Augur accounts worldwide \u2013 courtesy of Augur\nSpreading the Word\nIn a conversation with\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine, Sakich discussed some of the factors that have contributed to Augur\u2019s initial appeal.\nHe emphasized the company\u2019s commitment to making Augur approachable and easy to understand. They developed an\u00a0entertaining animated explanatory video(featuring the voice-over talents of country star Shooter Jennings) and a user-friendly platform.\n\u201cOur platform will be designed so the user will be able to create a market and place wagers on it without even knowing about what\u2019s going on \u201cin the background\u201d of the app,\u201d said Sakich. \u201cMore than a few participants in the REP crowdsale have been impressed by how simple it has been to generate an Ether address via\u00a0our sale site\u00a0and purchase Reputation Tokens with bitcoin.\u201d\nAugur has also invested a lot of time and energy over the past few months spreading the word both within and outside of the Bitcoin community \u2014 with a good measure of success. Gardner admits he\u2019s probably been to \u201cabout two dozen\u201d events and conferences, promoting the platform in the months leading up to the crowdsale.\nAugur also was a finalist in the\u00a0CNBC & Singularity University\u2019s Exponential Finance XCS Challenge\u00a0\u2014 the only blockchain-related technology to make it that far. According to Sakich, the applications committee was so impressed by the technology that \u201cthey decided to put us in the \u2018Breakthrough Technology\u2019 category rather than \u2018Finance.\u2019\u201d\nSakich pointed out that the most valuable part of being invited to the Exponential Finance conference was the opportunity to meet with \u201can amazingly influential and important list of attendees. \u2026The interest we had was fantastic and it exposed us to many important people, which undoubtedly [has] helped the crowdsale performance.\u201d\nIf early results of Augur\u2019s reputation sale are any indication, the team seems to be well on that road to success\n", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 20}

The Web Payments Working Group will launch by the end of September after the end of the review on September 15, start working on an overall Web payments architecture, and prepare key topics for discussion at the next Technical Plenary/Advisory Committee meeting (TPAC 2015) in October.\nThe W3C, led by World Wide Web inventor\u00a0Tim Berners-Lee, is an international body that develops open standards to ensure the long-term growth of the Web. The\u00a0Web Payments Interest Group\u00a0acts as the overall coordinator at W3C of avision\u00a0for Web Payments.\n\u201cThe Web Payments Working Group is not creating any new digital payment schemes, but rather integrating existing and emerging schemes more efficiently and securely into Web applications,\u201d states the W3C announcement. \u201cA standardized message flow should make it easier to automate payments, which will improve the overall security and user experience of making payments on the Web.\u201d\nThe Web Payments Interest Group recently updated its\u00a0Web Payments Use Cases 1.0\u00a0working draft. The Group also published a\u00a0FAQ\u00a0with more information about the anticipated\u00a0benefits\u00a0of the future standards, a\u00a0diagram\u00a0illustrating the high-level message flow, and some\u00a0examples\u00a0of different Web payment approaches.\nThe W3C Web Payments documentation makes only sparse references to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, which are only mentioned as possible options alongside other online payment means such as Google Wallet, Apple Pay, PayPal and\u00a0iDEAL, a payment method that enables consumers to pay online through their own banks. The Use Cases draft includes a short section dedicated to cryptocurrency payments with bitcoin and ripple, with a scenario that outlines an ideal payment experience using bitcoin, or a bitcoin-like cryptocurrency.\nInternet pioneers such as Ted Nelson, Marc Andreessen and Berners-Lee himself thought that the Internet should have a built-in framework for micropayments. Berners-Lee tried to include micropayments in Web protocols, but the idea hasn\u2019t been implemented so far.\n\u201cIn the late 1990s Berners-Lee tried to develop a micropayments system for the Web through the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),\u201d reported Walter Isaacson in his 2014 book \u201cThe Innovators: How a Group of Inventors, Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution.\u201d The idea was to devise a way to embed in a Web page the information needed to handle a small payment, which would allow different electronic wallet services to be created by banks or entrepreneurs. \u201cIt was never implemented, partly because of the changing complexity of banking regulations,\u201d noted Isaacson.\nThe preparatory work of the Web Payments Interest Group and the forthcoming work of the Web Payments Working Group can be seen as gradual steps to implement Berners-Lee\u2019s vision. However, it\u2019s surprising that the official W3C documents produced to date make only incidental mentions of bitcoin, which is the only form of Internet money and \u201cInternet native\u201d payment system that exists, works, effectively implements one-click Internet payments, and is rapidly gaining recognition and partial acceptance from the financial system.\nIsaacson reports that Andreessen mentioned bitcoin as a good model for standard Internet payment systems. \u201cIf I had a time machine and could go back to 1993, one thing I\u2019d do for sure would be to build in bitcoin or some similar form of cryptocurrency,\u201d Andreessen said.\nA possible explanation for the more timid approach of the W3C is that the organization prefers to distance itself from the more controversial aspects of bitcoin, including the possibility of private and semi-anonymous transactions, and wait for \u201csanitized\u201d versions of bitcoin.\n\nPhoto\u00a0Southbank Centre\u00a0/\u00a0Flickr (CC)", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 20}

This chip, the company claims, can generate a 45\u00a0percent\u00a0increase in hashrate while needing 50\u00a0percent\u00a0less electricity than its former chip, the BM1384.\n\u201cThe problem at the heart of designing chips for bitcoin mining is the careful balance of performance with electrical consumption. With lower power consumption, miners have lower electricity bills, or they can increase their hashrate without increasing their power expense,\u201d said a\u00a0Bitmain chip designer in a statement.\nAccording to the company, the BM1385 can attain 32.5 gigahash per second at a power consumption of 0.216 watts/gigahash-second using 0.66V. This chip was built on the 28-nanometer process of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC); the company felt that it could outperform chips that were built on 14 and 16 nanometer process nodes that didn\u2019t have full custom design techniques.\n\u201cThe BM1385 chip represents more than six months of full time research and development work from our chip design team, so it required a significant effort to produce. This being our first full-custom chip design, it took a lot more work than previous chips we\u2019ve put out,\u201d said Bitmain Head of North AMerica Jake Smith.\nFull custom design is an arduous process whereby the engineers have to lay each individual transistor inside the chip. However, while the creation process is more intensive and involves higher risk of failure at tape-out, the finished chips are able to do far more with less electricity.\n\u201cWe anticipate that before we release our full-custom 16 nanometer chip, the BM1385 will continue to be the industry standard for the bitcoin mining industry,\u201d said Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu.\u00a0Bitmain has grown very aggressive with releasing its previous chips. Its BMI1380, which was used in the AntMiner S1, was released in Q4 2013. Its BM1382 and BM1384 came out in Q2 and Q4 of 2014 respectively. This is the fourth chip in two years that Bitmain has released. When Bitmain announces the launch of its AntMiner S7, it will use\u00a0this BM1385 chip.\n\u201cA few of our competitors have also announced chips with similar power efficiencies; even though they won\u2019t be selling these they will also have an effect on the network. This will probably cause hashrate to increase, and also make a lot of older, less power-efficient miners become obsolete,\u201d added Smith.\nJacob is a product manager working in the industrial news space as well as a freelance writer covering finance.

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nShapeshift.io\u00a0CEO\u00a0Erik Voorhees\u00a0was\u00a0interviewed\u00a0by\u00a0Decentralized Applications Fund\u00a0Managing Director\u00a0David Johnston\u00a0at the\u00a0Texas Bitcoin Conference\u00a0in late March, and the topics covered in the fireside chat involved everything from Bitcoin regulation to Voorhees\u2019 evolving stance on altcoins.\nNear the middle of the discussion, Johnston asked Voorhees about his philosophical beliefs and what drives him to continue his successful work in the Bitcoin space. Voorhees responded with a fascinating analogy between the freedom to choose one\u2019s religion and the freedom to choose one\u2019s money.\nThe Separation of Church and State\nWhen first asked about what drives him to continually push Bitcoin to as many people around the world as possible, Voorhees was quick to point to theseparation of church and state. He explained that this is something nearly everyone in developed nations agrees with and understands, and he would like to see this freedom of choice applied to other areas of society:\n\u201cWe all grow up in school \u2013 most of us, sadly, in public school \u2013 but, nevertheless, we learn about this thing that happened hundreds of years ago, which was the separation of church and state. We learn why that was so important that humans used to live in societies under which their religion \u2013 something very personal and precious to them as individuals \u2014 was under the management of an organization that could control those things. [They] could tell you what to worship and how, when and why. Somehow, society realized perhaps that was unethical \u2013 that we shouldn\u2019t permit control of something so personal and important to your life to be controlled by the state.\u201d\nThe Separation of Money and State\u00a0\nAfter discussing the separation of church and state, Voorhees applied the philosophy of freedom of choice to money. The Shapeshift.io CEO claimed the freedom to choose your money is, for many people, more important than being able to choose a religion. He noted that a separation of money and state might be just as \u2013 if not more important than \u2013 freedom of religion:\n\u201cIt is that narrative of human development under which I believe that we now have other fights to fight, and I would say in the realm of Bitcoin it is mainly the separation of money and state. Money is absolutely as fundamental to our lives as religion, and for many people it is far more fundamental to their lives as religion. It affects how your life unfolds. The choices that you make about money dictate the ramifications of your life and those around you. And so, to have an institution like money so controlled by a central entity \u2014 by a monopoly \u2014 is absurd. It is immoral. We should get rid of it.\u201d\nThe idea of free markets is still somewhat popular in the United States, but this logic never seems to apply to money. Although many Republicans often espouse the benefits of the free market in various political speeches, essentially none of them bring up the idea of\u00a0competing currencies. Most politicians in any part of the world seem rather selective when it comes to which markets are allowed to freely operate without government intervention.\nBitcoin Can Bring About This Much Needed Change\nDue to the decision by lawmakers to create a monopoly on money in each, separate jurisdiction, it has been difficult for alternative forms of money, such as gold and silver, to compete. Although the struggle in the past has been to convince politicians to allow different forms of money to compete with fiat currency, Voorhees alluded to the fact that Bitcoin may create a situation where those politicians don\u2019t have a choice in the matter:\n\u201cIt seems crazy to say this, but perhaps we should permit competition in money, permit competition in financial structures, just as we permit competition in religion. We allow multiple churches to exist. Why do we do that? And why don\u2019t we do that with money? I think it\u2019s a hypocrisy that our children will someday look back on and realize, \u2018Wow, that was really obvious.\u2019 And Bitcoin is what will bring that change about.\u201d\nBitcoin is already\u00a0competing favorably\u00a0against the Venezuelan bolivar when it comes to its usefulness as money, but it still has a long way to go before it can take down giants like the U.S. dollar or euro. Such a revolutionary change in what people use as money may never happen, but at least there is now competition for fiat currencies.", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 21}

That\u2019s why, at the Summer Budget, we appointed a special envoy for this fast growing sector,\u201d\u00a0said Cameron. \u201cI\u2019m pleased that Innovate Finance\u2019s manifesto has set such ambitious goals, including the creation of 100,000 jobs. This will ensure we are a world leader in the development of financial services technologies.\u201d\nThe FinTech special envoy mentioned by Cameron is\u00a0Eileen Burbridge, a partner at Passion Capital, a London early-stage technology investment fund, dubbed the \u201cQueen of British VCs\u201d by Fortune.\nThe manifesto doesn\u2019t mention Bitcoin and blockchain-based digital currencies explicitly. However, Great Britain is on its way to becoming\u00a0a global hub\u00a0for bitcoin and other digital currencies, with both the government and Bank of England having made recent moves designed to stimulate the development of digital FinTech.\nCameron\u2019s government has\u00a0launched a new research initiative\u00a0that brings together the Research Councils, Alan Turing Institute and Digital Catapult with industry in order to address the research opportunities and challenges for digital currency technology, and will increase research funding in this area by \u00a310 million ($14.6 million USD) to support this.\nCameron expressed very different views on cryptography \u2013 the technology that Bitcoin is built upon \u2013 and\u00a0recently said\u00a0that his government intends to ban strong encryption. Renowned industry expert Bruce Schneier\u00a0noted\u00a0that the proposed ban would be a disaster for the U.K. technology leadership and economy.\n\u201cWhen the U.S. tried to ban strong cryptography in the 1990s, hundreds of foreign companies sprang up to fill the gap in what the market demanded,\u201d said Schneier. \u201cToday, security is vitally important in everything we do online, and this law would put U.K. businesses and citizens under an enormous disadvantage.\u201d\nIt appears that perhaps Cameron\u2019s government hasn\u2019t realized \u2013 yet \u2013 that technological freedom and technological leadership are two sides of the same coin, and eliminating one would destroy the other.", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 2}

In January 2012 I was asked to become Mt.Gox\u2019s CEO, a process which led to my dismissal in May 2012. My statement along with other ex-employees have led the Tokyo Metro Police\u2019s arrest on embezzlement and \u2018illegal manipulation of accounting.\u2019\n\u201cWe plan to eat pizza in front of Mark while he is in prison\u2026\u201d\nBarr talked openly about the work culture at Mt.Gox while he was there and about Karpeles in particular.\nBarr wrote, \u201cAll in all, I felt Mt.Gox was [a role-playing game] to Mark, as he didn\u2019t quite grasp the reality that the money being in deposited into his bank account meant more to other people than just numbers on his screen.\u201d\nIn the post, Barr took the opportunity to clarify what his role was during his time at Mt.Gox. He also wrote at length about what he knew of the company\u2019s state of affairs. He explained that Karpeles had wanted Barr to take over as CEO, a position Barr declined when he realized that he couldn\u2019t get access to the information necessary to paint a clear picture of the company\u2019s financial situation.\n\u201cBasically, after Mark asked me to be CEO, I tried my best at due-diligence. I asked Mark to show me the financials of the company. He wouldn\u2019t, or feigned that he would do it later, all while pressuring me to take the role.\u201d\nBarr asserted that his \u201cdue diligence\u201d unearthed discrepancies in the company\u2019s financials.\n\u201cI confronted Mark about it, told him I couldn\u2019t take the role if he couldn\u2019t explain this gross incompetence in spending (he was also asking employees other than myself to find investors\u2026something impossible without knowing the financial status of the company).\u201d\nAround the same time, we learned that Mark only had one bank account, shared with Mt.Gox\u2019s customer deposits. That was the nail in the coffin.\u201d\nBarr went on to describe Karpeles\u2019s response to being confronted with allegations of financial wrongdoing:\n\u201c\u2026his answer was simply: \u2018My grandmother lives in a castle in Switzerland.\u2019\u00a0That was it. That was all, we couldn\u2019t get him to explain it. He just ignored the rest of our inquiries. It. was. insane.\u201d\nBarr went on to make the stunning assertion that Mt.Gox\u2019s only bank account, the one that held customer deposits, was actually Karpeles\u2019s own personal account.\nBarr also revealed his strong belief that Mt.Gox had no cold storage for any funds stored on the exchange.\n\u201c[Karpeles] said there were many cold-wallets, what I witnessed was one\u00a0hot wallet\u2026\nAll I know is that BTC was sitting there when Mark logged in. How he would have moved it from cold storage into a single wallet on a remote-desktop, I have no idea\u2026 it\u2019s possible, but I don\u2019t know how to prove it.\u201d\nFurthermore, Barr said that Karpeles was the only one with the keys to any of the wallets.\n\u201cMark said that if he died there would be hints that one of his best friends could follow to find and unlock the cold-wallets. When I asked said friend, he said he had no idea what Mark was talking about.\u201d\nRegarding the missing 200,000 BTC that were lost and then mysteriously recovered by Karpeles, Barr said, \u201cWhen I read the news, I was surprised to hear that 200,000 coins were recovered. My first thought was\u2026 of course\u2026 [expletive]. How is that even [expletive] possible\u2026 I guess, to be more specific. I mean, even in usual terms, not knowing if my bank account has $8000 vs $2000 dollars is pretty [expletive] significant\u2026Sorry, I dunno what to conclude but it feels like a lie, or gross ineptitude\u2026 either way it\u2019s really, very, upsetting.\u201d\nHowever, as for whether or not he thinks that Karpeles actually committed robbery, Barr was non-committal.\n\u201cI think gross incompetence happened, and Mark tried to cover it up. I don\u2019t believe he is outright malicious, but certainly ignorantly-malicious. If it\u2019s an A) or B) question, I believe he lost them [the missing bitcoins], but considering other s***\u00a0I\u2019ve seen\u2026 I really can\u2019t be certain.\u201d\nOn a personal level, Barr\u2019s opinion of his former employer was conflicted.\n\u201c[Karpeles] had (has) the ego of someone wanting to prove themselves, some anti-social behaviors, some social behaviors, and everything in between. He\u2019s still a mystery to me, and absolutely unpredictable.\nWhen asked if he wanted authorities to \u201cthrow the book\u201d at Karpeles, Barr\u2019s response was similarly measured.\n\u201cMy honestly feeling is I liked Mark, as just\u2026 a geek. I\u2019m a geek, I get other geeks. We\u2019re all wired differently but similarly and I enjoyed that about him. I think most others had the same experience, and I think it reflects in his media personality (harmless, but awkward and untrustworthy)\u2026. He\u2019s not evil, just he justifies the things he thinks [he needs] to do to preserve whatever image he has for himself.\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 2}

BitCrystal is a tradable Counterparty asset, which can be traded and purchased on the Counterparty platform.\nBitCrystals also operate on the bitcoin blockchain and therefore, there is not much difference in using bitcoin or BitCrystals.\n\u201cBoth Bitcoin and BitCrystals are digital tokens operating on the Bitcoin blockchain, and both have monetary value,\u201d Emily from ShapeShift told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything significantly different about using one vs. the other.\u201d\nEverdreamSoft initially planned to launch its in-game token sale on a decentralized bitcoin-powered crowdfunding platform Swarm. However, due to technical difficulties, the game developers will be launching its crowdfunding campaign on the BitCrystals website.\nFurthermore,\u00a0Spells of Genesis\u00a0has partnered with ShapeShift to have the altcoin exchange power the\u00a0Spells of Genesis\u00a0BitCrystals Token Sale, begining on August 4.\nThe ShapeShift team explained on their blog, \u201cBitCrystals were designed to purchase new card decks and game items while working as the medium of exchange within the gameplay. These tokens are tradable Counterparty assets which serve as the in-game currency in\u00a0Spells of Genesis.\u201d\n\u201cBitCrystals will be available to buy or sell on ShapeShift after the crowdsale is over,\u201d Emily told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine.\nExpected Sale\nEverdreamSoft expects to serve tens of thousands of users in the first few months from its launch.\n\u201cWe expect the first few months to quickly achieve about 50,000 MAU (Monthly Active Users),\u201d Shaban Shaame of EverdreamSoft told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cUsually the conversion between a free player and a paying player in the game industry is about 5% to 9%. If we convert 5% of the player base into purchaser we estimate to have 2,500 paying players. In our experience on our previous game\u00a0Moonga\u00a0the MARPPU (Monthly Average Revenue Per Paying user) is about $40 USD. So the first month\u2019s estimated BitCrystal we receive should be around 2,500 * 40 USD = $100,000 USD value of BitCrystals per month.\u201d\nShaban explained that the game intends to take full advantage of the Bitcoin blockchain and its shared economy.\n\u201cWe believe when project [is] crowdfunded people who pre-purchased the product should receive a part of it,\u201d Shaban said. \u201cThey should take part in fueling the game economy. Once the game is funded and up and running, all the assets we put on sale will be acquired with BitCrystals (BCY).\u201d\nImage Herckeim / EverdreamSoft", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 3}

She is a widely respected authority on multi-signature governance, smart contracts, and legal innovation with cryptocurrencies. Third Key Solutions is the culmination of her work advising bitcoin startups in multi-signature governance processes and key management.\nYour company\u2019s recovery plan is the most important document you can create to ensure your business will survive an emergency. If you operate a bitcoin-, altcoin- or asset-token-based business, a recovery plan isn\u2019t just nice to have \u2013 it\u2019s absolutely necessary. A strong, well-thought-out recovery plan can help to prevent opportunistic fraud and asset transfer mistakes by providing clear guidance during atypical events. Coin recovery should be just one part of your overall strategic operations and recovery plan. These guidelines are one tool that your company may use in building its recovery plan.\nWhen to plan? New organizations should complete the plan prior to launch, reviewing and updating the plan quarterly throughout the first year. After Year One, you\u2019ll probably need to update your plan once or twice a year. If your company has already launched and you don\u2019t have a recovery plan, do it now. Don\u2019t wait. Don\u2019t put it off until you find some spare time. You owe it to your customers, your team, your investors and yourself to get this done within the next 30 days.\nIs this a complete guide? No, but it\u2019s a great start. The following list is meant to begin a discussion within your company about policies and procedures relating to recovery. It\u2019s not meant to be an exhaustive list, and your team should add concerns as they arise.\nVital Records:\nWhat vital records are required for recovery of coin?What vital records are required for the continuation of the business? (For example, what data do you need of employees, clients, vendors, investors; accounting and payroll records; insurance policies; tax returns; contracts; etc.?)Where are they backed up?How will they be accessed in case of emergency?Who has authorization to access them?Are they encrypted?Who has the encryption passwords?Who is responsible for records management?Who is responsible to update the backup copies of these records and how often?Where are insurance contracts located, if any?\nRecovery Event Processes: (recovering funds from single addresses)\nWho is responsible to initiate the recovery and under what circumstances?Who must initially verify the request and what are the verification standards?How is verification documented in an auditable way?To what address will the recovery transaction sweep the funds?Who created the address and how is customer/client control preserved?Has the new address been tested?Who will create the recovery transaction?How will the recovery transactions be verified, as properly authorized and going to the correct address?What methods are in place to eliminate opportunities for collusion or bad actors?How will the verified transactions be transmitted to the recovery company?What is the process for the recovery company to verify the validity of the recovery request?What if the recovery company cannot verify the recovery request or if the recovery request was unauthorized?If the recovery company provides signed transactions, who is responsible to broadcast them and under what circumstances, if any, should they not be broadcast? (This is particularly relevant in an entire tree recovery)\nRecovery Event Processes: (recovering funds from HD or HDM trees)\nReview the Recovery Event Process in terms of recovering an entire tree or all trees.\nWhat changes?Are there additional safeguards in place to prevent errors?Who, within the company, will be responsible to oversee the recovery of trees?In the event the company is no longer operational, who will be responsible to facilitate recovery?\nPayment for Recovery:\nWho will pay transaction fees for the recovery transactions?How will transaction fees be paid (company hot wallet, pre-divided UTXO, customer)?Will the transaction fees be chained, affecting confirmation of other recovery transactions?Who will pay the recovery company\u2019s fees?If a fund has been set up to pay recovery fees, who manages/administers the fund?If not, how will recovery companies be paid?\nCommunication:\nWho is responsible to communicate to customers/clients/employees/public about the recovery?Are there communication policies in place that govern crisis communications?If so, where can employees find the policies during a crisis?\nChanges to the Recovery Plan:\nHow often is the plan reviewed and by whom? (must be at least annually)Who is authorized to make changes to the plan and by what process are changes made?Where is the recovery plan stored?Are redundant copies stored securely off-site?How will they be accessed in case of emergency?Who has authorization to access them?Are they stored encrypted?Who has the encryption passwords?Who is responsible to update the redundant plans and ensure the most current versions are properly stored?\nBuilding a Key Compromise Policy:\nHow many keys are currently in use in the company and to which assets/addresses/projects are they associated?Who are the authorized signers for each address and where are the primary keys stored?Where and how are backup keys stored?What is a key compromise? (Examples include: system hacked, vulnerability identified on key generation or storage device, physical compromise of key storage location, authorized signer leaves the organization, incomplete chain of custody logs.)How will the company learn that one or more keys may have been compromised?Who should be notified of possible compromise?What confidentiality policies, if any, are implemented during investigation of compromise?What steps should be taken (in succession) during the investigation of a possible compromise?How will a compromise be confirmed or disproved?Who should be notified if compromise is confirmed?How will they be notified?What is the process for investigating possible compromise?What is the process for migrating funds if the company\u2019s security is breached? If the third party\u2019s security is breached?What is the process for limiting damage to clients and the company itself in the event of key compromise?\nOther Considerations:\nPersonnel: In the event of emergency, who will be responsible to coordinate company efforts and lead the Recovery Team? Who should be part of a Recovery Team?\nPhysical Locations: If you have a physical location, you should also consider physical evacuation procedures, employee communications, and business continuity plans for geographic natural disasters including fire, flood, etc.\nEncrypted Communications: As a reminder, encrypting and signing communications whenever possible protects both confidentiality and authenticity (prevents man-in-the-middle and impersonation attacks).\nAudited Standards: Companies should consider building systems compliant to industry best practices and standards, such as the CryptoCurrency Security Standard.

At 3pm ET, the US-facing online poker site is hosting its signature Million Dollar Sunday poker tournament, a $1 million guaranteed Texas Hold\u2019em event with a first place prize of $200,000 guaranteed.\n\u201cAt Americas Cardoom, we\u2019ve become hugely popular among Bitcoin users,\u201d said Americas Cardroom spokesperson Michael Harris. \u201cWe make it easy to deposit and withdraw with Bitcoin so players all over the world can get to the tables and play anonymously. And best of all, with a $200,000 first place prize and another $800,000 spread among those who cash in the tournament, we\u2019re able to offer players the fastest way to get their hands on their winnings.\u201d\nThe Million Dollar Sunday kicks off on August 2nd\u00a0at 3pm ET. It\u2019s the third Million Dollar Sunday tournament of the year featuring a $1 million guaranteed prize pool. Players can buy directly in for $500+40 using Bitcoin or win their spot through a low buy-in satellite.\nAmericas Cardroom first launched the $1 million online poker tournament earlier this year, bringing back large-scale poker in America. Until the introduction of the Million Dollar Sunday, it had been almost four years since US poker players saw a Sunday million dollar poker tournament.\nAmericas Cardroom is at the forefront of bringing back the glory days of poker and many argue that it\u2019s easier to deposit and withdraw today than it was four years ago. That\u2019s because before their departure from the United States, most online poker sites relied on credit card processing, a method that had been plagued with declines.\nWith Bitcoin, players are guaranteed virtually instant deposits with no rejections. And better yet, those cashing out their winnings are able to see funds in their hands the same day the request is made.\nWhat\u2019s more, unlike other deposit methods, Bitcoin comes with no transaction fees, other than the standard \u201cminer\u2019s fee\u201d associated with the cryptocurrency. As soon as the deposit is made, Bitcoin is automatically converted to poker chips, each with a real money US dollar value. Players are free to cash out using Bitcoin or any other available withdrawal method.\nBitcoin users can get started with as little as $5. The biggest single deposit available is $1,000 and daily deposits are capped at $1,000, too. Players can deposit up to $8,000 per month using Bitcoin.\nMore information on the Million Dollar Sunday and Bitcoin can be found at AmericasCardroom.eu.\nAbout Americas CardroomAmericas Cardroom joined the Winning Poker Network in 2011.

Consider what would happen if every state in the union followed suit \u2013 it would cost $250,000 just to apply for licenses in all 50 states.\u201d\nFurthermore, the current \u201cversion\u201d of BitLicense requires Bitcoin startups and exchanges to meet a long list of qualifications before they can be licensed to operate legally. For most small exchanges and startups, it is extremely difficult to meet all the requirements and comply with the\u00a0set of regulations\u00a0detailed in BitLicense.\n\u201cIn the case of BitLicense, once you pay the application fee, you\u2019re then facing a long list of requirements that would disqualify most small businesses,\u201d D\u2019Agosta said. \u201cAs a result, we find ourselves in No Man\u2019s Land, where we very much want to service our New York customers, but we are not big enough to qualify for a BitLicense.\u201d\nCoin Center Executive Director Jerry Brito told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine\u00a0that Poloniex\u2019s decision to shut down in New York is one he\u00a0expects to see repeated in the industry.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that small companies are ceasing operations because they can\u2019t afford to go through the licensing process. A clear, certain, and graduated on-ramp for startups could have prevented this, but the final BitLicense only has a discretionary transitional license which is probably too uncertain for startups and investors to plan around.\u201d\nImpact on Users\nWhile the number of Poloniex users in New York isn\u2019t as high as other states, \u201cgiven that we are a relatively small exchange that prides itself in the relationships we build with our community of users, the impact on us is big and noticeable,\u201d said D\u2019Agosta.\nValidity\nThe BitLicense drafted by The New York Department of Financial Services requires exchanges to \u201cprotect\u201d customers by recording sensitive user data and provide the information to law enforcement when demanded. Ironically, ShapeShift founder Eric Voorhees\u00a0stated\u00a0that such \u201cprotection\u201d leaves any bitcoin or cryptocurrency exchanges vulnerable to data breaches and hacking attacks, which may leak sensitive customer data.\n\u201cWe understand, and to a degree, empathize with state regulators who are tasked with writing and enacting laws to protect their constituents. But more often, we hear the voices of those who believe that state regulations have very little to do with protecting people and see the impending Bitcoin regulations only as a means to control and reap profits for their respective states.\u00a0As with the birth of most regulations, the truth is probably somewhere in the middle. If we had the regulators\u2019 ear on the topic, we would want to get across the point that much like any industry, cryptocurrency has businesses of all shapes and sizes as well. BitLicense was not written with small businesses in mind,\u201d said D\u2019Agosta.\n\u00a0\nThis article has been updated to provide a full quote by\u00a0Tristan D\u2019Agosta\u00a0in its proper context.

In 2007, ABN AMRO was the second-largest bank in the Netherlands and the eighth largest in Europe by assets. Then the bank was acquired by a consortium of international banks and eventually bailed out and nationalized by the Dutch government, which expressed intentions to restore private ownership at due time.\n\u201cFasten your seatbelts,\u201d says van Os. \u201cWhat the Internet has done for information and the way we communicate, the blockchain will do for value and the way we look at trust. The financial world is going to flip upside-down.\u201d\nThe article summarizes the unique advantages of blockchain-based financial technology, which today are recognized by the mainstream financial establishment: faster and cheaper transactions, which are made intrinsically secure by the distributed, decentralized nature of the blockchain.\n\u201cEach node maintains an identical copy of a shared transaction ledger \u2013 the so-called \u2018single source of truth,\u2019\u201d says van Os. \u201cAs transactions take place, the nodes communicate with each other to verify that the transaction is valid. If the ledgers don\u2019t match up, the transaction is rejected. That virtually eliminates the single point of failure: If one server is hacked, the other nodes will recognize the intrusion and block the hacking attempt. The more nodes added to the Blockchain, the more security the transaction has.\u201d\nSmart contracts represent a disruptive innovation with a huge potential. In 2001, legendary cryptographer Nick Szabo\u00a0spoke\u00a0of smart contracts that solved the problem of trust by being self-executing.\n\u201cThrough specific scripts in the blockchain, all conditions of any contractual agreement can be stored, verified and secured within the system,\u201d says van Os of smart contracts.\nNext-generation \u201cBitcoin 2.0\u201d platforms such as Ethereum, scheduled to\u00a0go live\u00a0in a few weeks, implement smart contracts. According to an Ethereum spokesperson, global banks and financial corporations are\u00a0showing interest\u00a0in Ethereum.\nInterestingly, van Os doesn\u2019t have much to say about the fashionable\u00a0debate\u00a0about the blockchain as a system vs. bitcoin as a currency \u2013 the term \u201cbitcoin\u201d is never used in the article, which seems to imply that van Os considers the bitcoin currency as an early, incidental and not very interesting application of the blockchain. On the other hand, he clearly states that the blockchain technology will change everything in the financial world, and banks should get on board.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear to see that blockchain has the potential to turn the financial world upside-down,\u201d says van Os. \u201cSo, what can we do? How do we stop ourselves from becoming obsolete? The answer is quite simple. We learn. We explore. We investigate. We open ourselves up to change, and embrace all the possibilities that lie in store for our futures. We not only need to change the way we do business, but the type of business we do.\u201d\nThe ABN AMRO Innovation Center, opened in September 2013, explores trends, problems, and solutions relevant to the bank\u2019s business, and organizes several networking events for clients, partners and staff. One of these regular events is Startup Friday, held once a month. A video recording of a recent Startup Friday, dedicated to the blockchain, is\u00a0available online\u00a0(partly in Dutch).", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 7}
{"title": "Ethereum Network Continues Thawing Process in Anticipation of the Start of Trading", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/ethereum-network-begins-thawing-process-anticipation-start-trading-1438829116/", "birthday": "Aug 5, 2015  10:45 PM EST", "date": "2015-08-06 03:45:00", "content": "Ethereum is finishing its \u2018Thawing\u2019 phase, designed to help the network grow organically at a slow and steady pace. In a matter of hours, the network will be handling transactions and trading will begin. Ethereum CCO Stephen Tual published a new blog post asking miners are asked to update their clients.\nTual published an update last night on the thawing process that Ethereum has been engaged in since its recent launch. Until now, miners were able to verify and add blocks to the blockchain, but no transactions were possible because of an artificially low limit on how much \u2018gas\u2019 could be spent on the network.\nThis artificial limit is ready to be lifted, but it requires miners to update their Ethereum clients to the latest version. Tual writes:\u00a0\u201cThe thawing\u00a0pull request\u00a0has been merged for the\u00a0Go client\u00a0and the Master branch has been updated. If you\u2019re still running branch release 1.0.0 please switch to Master.\u201d\nFor users implementing a\u00a0C++\u00a0Ethereum client, he suggests that, \u201cthey can also switch to master once merged, and binaries will be made available shortly.\u201d He adds, \u201cIf you\u2019d rather not update eth but still wish to help thaw the network, you can also just restart eth with an extra parameter of \u2013gas-floor 3141592.\u201d\nThe gas limit will not be released immediately, but will grow gradually. Ethereum\u2019s gas price is determined by miners and how much of their computing power they are wiling to contribute to the network. If no miners update their client and raise the artificial limit they are willing to accept, then no transactions will be possible on the Ethereum network.\nHowever, even if all miners raise the limit to the max, it will still take at least 28 hours to reach the max gas limit and at least 6 hours for the network to be able to process basic transactions. According to Tual, this is \u201cbecause the protocol forces them to climb slowly at a certain rate. That rate is equal to previous block limit / 1024.\u201d\nHe adds that \u201cwe\u2019re going to reach 3M within 28h assuming a steady 15s block time including propagation. But here\u2019s the thing \u2013 not all miners are going to update in time, some might forget and some might never update!\u201d\nWhat about trading?\nTrading is expected to begin soon after Ethereum transactions can begin to happen. Various exchanges have confirmed that they will be trading Ether, including:\n\nGatecoin\nKraken\nPoloniex\nYunbi\nNXT\u2019s asset exchange, backed by\u00a0SuperNET.\n\nHow do I import my presale Ether?\nIf you bought Ether during last year\u2019s presale, you\u2019ll need to import the coins into an Ethereum wallet to be able to move them. This process is still somewhat technical and requires the use of a command line interface to an Ethereum node according to\u00a0this guide.\nSome exchanges will likely facilitate this process. If you are not comfortable with running a node and using the command line interface, more user-friendly options may be available within several days.", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 6}

While recent reports from Expedia suggest that it has seen a decrease in bitcoin payments, TigerDirect shared a different story.\nAccording to Leeds, TigerDirect has been thrilled with its decision to accept bitcoin. Leeds noted that Bitcoin has drawn new users to TigerDirect, with 46 percent of customers purchasing with bitcoin being new users.\u00a0The company also told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine\u00a0that the average order placed with bitcoin is 30 percent larger than the average order.\nLeeds explained that TigerDirect sees the highest volume of bitcoin orders during periods of volatility for bitcoin price. These purchases are typically luxury items such as high-definition TVs, gaming consoles and computer monitors.\n\u201cOn days when the price is rising, we see users eager to spend some of their newfound wealth. And when the price begins falling, we see others who want to avoid the volatility by spending it on consumer electronics,\u201d said Leeds.\nDespite the fall of the bitcoin price into the $200s, TigerDirect has still seen consistent bitcoin transaction volume.\nAdvantages for Bitcoin Companies\nIn addition to it\u2019s consumer electronics business, TigerDirect also supplies hardware to many businesses, including a significant number of Bitcoin companies. Some of these companies include miners who use TigerDirect to buy power supplies, cooling systems and other hardware. These miners do not have to convert their bitcoin to cash, as they can pay directly with the bitcoin that they have mined.\nTigerDirect was originally introduced to Bitcoin by some of it\u2019s employees who were early adopters and miners of the currency.\n\u201cWe\u2019d recommend Bitcoin to any company considering it,\u201d Leeds said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a fantastic experience accepting it, and BitPay allows us to integrate the payments into our existing checkout flow easily.\u201d\n", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 7}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\n\u00a0Xapo\u00a0CEO\u00a0Wences Casares\u00a0has been one of Bitcoin\u2019s strongest supporters since 2011, but not many people have heard the story of how he originally got into this new form of digital money.\n\u00a0The Argentinian-born entrepreneur has been able to create one of the most\u00a0well-capitalized\u00a0companies in the space, and he was able to mystify the likes of\u00a0Dick Costolo,\u00a0Marc Andreessen,\u00a0Reid Hoffman\u00a0and other Silicon Valley giants by transferring roughly $250,000 worth of bitcoin between multiple smartphones within a matter of minutes. But what led Casares to Bitcoin in the first place?\nTrying to Send Money to Friends in Argentina\nUnlike many of the Bitcoin proponents who talk about how the digital money is going to change the world without having their own, personal need for it, Casares came across Bitcoin while attempting to send money to childhood friends in Argentina. The Xapo CEO explained the process of finding out about Bitcoin on arecent episode\u00a0of\u00a0EconTalk:\n\u201cI first learned about Bitcoin in 2011. I live in California, in Palo Alto, and a group of childhood friends from Argentina were doing a project where we needed to send money to that project. And I couldn\u2019t send money from California to Argentina, so I was looking to see if my sister, who\u2019s there, could give the friends some money and I could pay her later. And one of my friends \u2013 who\u2019s not tech savvy or financially savvy \u2013 said, \u2018Hey, why don\u2019t you use Bitcoin?\u2019\u201d\nGiving Bitcoin a Chance\nAlthough Casares admits he was skeptical at first, he decided to give Bitcoin a chance as a new international payment mechanism. He described the entire process of using Bitcoin to send money to his friends in Argentina in his recent EconTalk interview:\n\u201cSo, I was curious and I looked [it] up online, and, I think on Craigslist, I found someone who was willing to meet with me at the cafe in Palo Alto and gave me some bitcoin and I gave them the cash. Then, I just got the bitcoin on my cell phone and I sent them to my friend in Argentina and the next day he has . . . [Argentine] pesos. And I just couldn\u2019t believe what happened.\u201d\nMany bitcoiners remember the first time they used the digital money because it is a strange feeling to have actual value stored on an electronic device as a string of bits.\n\u201cI felt like I was witnessing the beginning of the Internet. It was that kind of fascination,\u201d Casares said.\n\u00a0Abra is the Mainstream Version of Casares\u2019s 2011 Experience\nWences Casares\u2019s story has been repeated many more times all over the world since 2011, and there is now an app that captures the essence of that experience in a user-friendly manner.\u00a0Abra\u00a0allows users to send digital cash to anyone else in the world, and that digital cash can then be transferred to local currency via a peer-to-peer (P2P) transfer.\nPerhaps the most noteworthy aspect of the app is that it also locks the value of the digital cash to U.S. dollars, which means users don\u2019t need to worry about bitcoin\u2019s price volatility for the duration of the transfer. Abra is powered by smart contracts built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.\nAbra is just now coming to market, but Casares already experienced this new phenomenon four years ago. As time goes by, we will continue to see more apps developed that were first thought of in the early days of IRC chatrooms and bitcointalk.org\u00a0threads.\nPhoto\u00a0Christopher Michel\u00a0/\u00a0Flickr", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 7}

In June, online bitcoin job ads surged to a record high of 306.\nReuters\u00a0notes that Schlaefer probably would make more money at Goldman, but what attracts him and other migrants from Wall Street is the ability to be part of the growth in Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology.\n\u201cA lot of people are entering the Bitcoin space as the sector has reached an overall level of funding that\u2019s hard to ignore,\u201d said Coinsetter founder and CEO Jaron Lukasiewicz, who moved to the Bitcoin world in late 2012 from private equity firm The CapStreet Group.\nTotal investments in Bitcoin companies for 2015 \u2013 totaling $375.4 million in the first six months \u2013 have already exceeded 2014\u2019s total of $339.4 million. According to Tomasz Tunguz, a partner at venture capital firm\u00a0Redpoint, Bitcoin is the\u00a0fastest growing\u00a0area of startup investment in 2015, but it is still relatively underfunded, which makes it an ideal investment target for venture capitalists and institutional players alike.\nIn fact, as recently reported by\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine, major financial players such as\u00a0Citi,\u00a0UBS\u00a0and\u00a0Barclays\u00a0are exploring the blockchain, while a\u00a0BNP Paribas\u00a0analyst is persuaded that the blockchain could revolutionize finance. According to the Santander Innoventures report \u201cThe Fintech 2.0 Paper: Rebooting financial services,\u201d blockchain-based technology could save banks $20 billion per year by 2022.\nOther top financial professionals who made the jump to Bitcoin mentioned in the\u00a0Reuters\u00a0article are Paul Chou, founder and chief executive officer of Ledger X (formerly at Goldman Sachs), and Henri Chan, chief operating officer at digital wallet platform Airbitz (formerly at Deutsche Bank, UBS and Morgan Stanley).\nFormer JPMorgan Chase & Co. executive\u00a0Blythe Masters, the creator of the modern credit default swap, (a derivative used to trade credit risks), who now heads blockchain company\u00a0Digital Asset Holdings, is not mentioned in the\u00a0Reuters\u00a0article but is probably the best known financial heavyweight now active in the blockchain space. At the recent Exponential Finance 2015 conference in New York, Masters\u00a0said\u00a0that the market for financial blockchain applications ultimately will be measured in the trillions.\n\u201cHow seriously should you take [the blockchain]?\u201d Masters asked. \u201cAbout as seriously as you should have taken the concept of the Internet in the early 1990s.

Many analysts suspected that the high inflation rate and unstable economy of Argentina and Brazil have caused a surge of growth in Latin America\u2019s bitcoin industry.\nWhile this may be true for Argentina, a country where the majority of the population is willing to pay 20 percent above international rates to obtain U.S. dollars and suffer from\u00a0annual inflation rate\u00a0which currently stands at 28.2 percent, the increase of inflation rate and bitcoin growth in Brazil is entirely coincidental, says Daniel Novy, the founder of Brazilian\u00a0bitcoin exchange,\u00a0BaseBit.\n\u201cWhen inflation is high, everyone buys government bonds,\u201d Novy told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThey are offering about 14 percent a year. It\u2019s a very good deal comparable to the most profitable hedge funds you can find in America. It doesn\u2019t make much sense to use bitcoin to protect yourself against a 9.6 percent inflation per year when the bitcoin volatility is about 50-plus percent per year. I mean, you don\u2019t use a more volatile asset to protect yourself against a less volatile one. And having the option to protect yourself using government bonds, which offers a premium over the inflation, makes the use of bitcoin less attractive yet.\u201d\nMany industry analysts\u00a0began to suspect that the growth of Bitcoin and the surge of bitcoin transactions in Brazil is caused by the country\u2019s\u00a012-year high inflation rate, which currently stands at 9.56 percent.\nIncrease in Merchants\nRegardless of the inflation and the decline of Brazil\u2019s economy, the number of bitcoin merchants has increased significantly over the last few months. Novy toldBitcoin Magazine\u00a0that the number of bitcoin merchants in the e-commerce industry has increased, \u201cbut it\u2019s definitely not related to inflation. \u2026 Bitcoin has a bad reputation here, but anyway the merchants are definitely being more opened to it.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cThe bad reputation is mostly due to the bad news that arrives here. Like bitcoin being used by money laundering, kidnapping with rescue paid in bitcoin, exchanges closing their doors and running away with bitcoins from its clients, things like that. Whenever bitcoin is on the newspaper, [it] is for a bad reason. The path to remove this bad reputation from it, in my opinion, is to have more magazines and newspapers showing to the general public the advantages of \u2026 bitcoin.\u201d\nAccording to recent report released by bitValor.com, monthly bitcoin transaction volume in at all bitcoin exchanges in Brazil stood at 10,000 BTC, around $2.8 million USD.\nDespite the high monthly bitcoin volume in Brazil, Novy explained that not a lot of people in Brazil are aware of bitcoin. The more serious problem, he says, is the lack of investment and capital for Bitcoin startups, and the overall environment of the country which is not exactly friendly to Bitcoin/digital currency startups. According to\u00a0BM&F BOVESPA\u00a0Bank \u201coperation of organized securities markets and custody and settlement systems require prior authorization of the CVM and the Central Bank.\u201d\n\u201cAs an example, my wife participated recently in a seminar for entrepreneurs and on one, again: no one knew about Bitcoin!\u201d Novy said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of unbelievable, but that\u2019s Brazil\u2026 new technologies take really long to get to the mainstream here. I see a lot of reasons for that but the principals are: a) complete lack of seed capital and venture capitalists. If you can receive 14 percent per year return doing\u2026 nothing, it doesn\u2019t make sense to risk your money! b) lack of incentives from government for startups.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThis article has been updated to show that BaseBit is not the largest Bitcoin exchange in Brazil.", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 11}

The Local Bitcoins team wrote on their\u00a0blog:\n\u201cFrom today onwards users from New York are no longer allowed to use LocalBitcoins because of the legislation known as the BitLicense (23 NYCRR 200) which makes it a federal offense to sell virtual currency to people living in New York unless you have applied for the license. This new regulation would require anyone selling Bitcoins through our service to acquire the BitLicense if they sell Bitcoins to residents of New York.\u201d\nNew Yorkers who have depended on the services of Local Bitcoins would have to cross the river and sell or purchase bitcoin\u00a0in New Jersey legally.\nBitQuick\nBoost VC-backed bitcoin trading platform BitQuick has restricted access to New York residents and decided to join Shapeshift and GoCoin\u2019s PleaseProtectConsumers.org campaign. The Please Protect Consumers campaign was first started by Shapeshift to educate the general population about the government\u2019s deep involvement in Bitcoin, privacy and security.\n\u201cThe fee and the compliance costs are just the start,\u201d Jad Mubaslat CEO and founder of BitQuick told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine\u00a0\u201cNo doubt those two things make it a deal killer for any small startup, but even putting that aside, this sets a dangerous precedent to other states. If every state did what New York did, it\u2019d be $250,000 just to apply to do business in the United States. No American wants that.\u201d\nBitQuick said that the regulations and restrictions set for digital currency startups in New York is overbearing compared to the size of the Bitcoin industry. The worst part, BitQuick and Shapeshift say, is that the government is trying to get hold of sensitive customer data of all exchanges. Such storage of data leaves sensitive customer information vulnerable to data breaches and hacking attacks.\n\u201cEven multinational companies and trillion-dollar governments have been unable to build a track record of data security,\u201d the Please Protect Consumers campaignstates. \u201cConsider that in America alone, identity theft resulting from these treasure troves of personal data caused over $24 billion in losses to consumers and businesses in 2012, compared with only $14 billion for all household burglary, vehicle and property theft combined.\u201d\nOnce exchanges begin to store sensitive customer data for every transaction/trade, they\u2019d have to build separate storages to keep such data for government agencies and law enforcements to retrieve.\nCoinSetter Settles\nWhile eight bitcoin startups have already left New York, one bitcoin exchange, CoinSetter, has decided to meet every requirement of BitLicense.\nAlmost every startup in New York has left or is planning to leave the state due to BitLicense. By submitting to BitLicense, CoinSetter hopes to remain as the only \u201clegal\u201d and \u201clicensed\u201d bitcoin exchange in New York to serve bitcoin users abandoned by their previous bitcoin exchanges/startups.\n\u201cWhile we serve a global user base of bitcoin traders, New York has long been Coinsetter\u2019s home,\u201d Coinsetter CEO Jaron Lukasiewicz\u00a0said. \u201cWe are happy to announce that Coinsetter will continue to be headquartered in New York City, a global capital of banking and financial technology, and to serve customers throughout New York State.\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 12}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nThere are plenty of people who believe they can predict the future of Bitcoin, but no one can really say for sure what will happen over the next five to 10 years. Some say that bitcoin will become the new reserve currency of the world, while others say issues involving\u00a0scalability\u00a0or regulation will eventually get in the way. Although no one can know what will happen, it\u2019s still useful to analyze where Bitcoin has been, where it is right now, and where it may go in the future.\nDave Hudson, who is vice president of software architecture at\u00a0Peernova\u00a0and previously worked at\u00a0Qualcomm, was\u00a0recently interviewed\u00a0on the\u00a0Epicenter Bitcoinpodcast, where he was asked about his thoughts on the future of mining by co-hosts\u00a0Brian Fabian Crain\u00a0and\u00a0S\u00e9bastien Couture. Hudson runs one of the most popular Bitcoin mining blogs at\u00a0hashingit.com.\nMining is Going to Burn a Lot of Energy\nAlthough it\u2019s unclear if the environmental costs associated with Bitcoin mining are something that could threaten the longevity of the network, it\u2019s clear that Hudson takes issue with the amount of energy that is spent on hashing power. These sorts of environmental concerns have inspired researchers to seek out alternatives toproof-of-work, such as\u00a0proof-of-stake, but it appears that Hudson does not think anybody has found the proper solution. He noted:\n\u201cMining, intrinsically, is something that\u2019s going to burn a lot of energy, so it has some implications because of that. I don\u2019t know of anybody who\u2019s yet come up with a good proposal of how you avoid that as a problem . . . Trying to find solutions to that would be extraordinarily useful.\u201d\nDecentralizing Actual Hashing Power is Not the Issue\nThe centralization of mining power is what many Bitcoin critics point to as the network\u2019s biggest weakness, and the reality is that it\u2019s extremely difficult to tell exactly how centralized mining has become over the years. While it\u2019s easy to find a breakdown of the overall network hashrate\u00a0in terms of mining pools, figuring out which entities are behind the actual hashing power is much more difficult. Dave Hudson shared his thoughts on hashing power decentralization during theEpicenter Bitcoin\u00a0interview:\n\u201cIf you want a network that is largely based on no centralized point of trust within it, there has to be some work done in terms of decentralizing the mining itself. Not actually the hashing \u2014 the hashing is actually the least interesting part of the decentralization \u2026 The worry right now is it\u2019s very easy for one miner to gain a very, very large share of the total hashrate, and it\u2019d be very difficult for anyone to necessarily know that was happening.\u201d\nMining Pools Need to Become Decentralized\nIn Hudson\u2019s eyes, it\u2019s clear that the\u00a0mining pools\u00a0are the aspect of the mining process that needs to be decentralized:\n\u201cThere has to be a big push towards decentralizing transaction selection and transaction processing. So this is really down to how the mining pools work, for example. We really need to get to a stage where there are no large mining pools, and that may not be something that is possible within the current Bitcoin network. It may be possible \u2014 certainly it\u2019s possible with a\u00a0hard fork, but I think hard forks themselves are problematic. If you could have a thousand pools, each of which control 0.1 percent of the network and could be demonstrably not actually colluding in some respect, you have a much better decentralized network.\u201d\nOne of the main reasons it is imperative that mining pools remain as decentralized as possible is that they become an easy attack vector when they control too much of the network hashrate. Mining pools are able to censor transactions, which means they can also be coerced by governments into censoring certain types of transactions.\nThe point of Bitcoin is supposed to be censorship resistance, and the network begins to lose its core value proposition when the total number of mining pools are limited. In a situation where there are only a handful of mining pools controlling the vast majority of hashing power, it becomes more difficult to see the difference between Bitcoin and\u00a0PayPal.\n\u00a0\nPhoto\u00a0BalticServers.com\u00a0/\u00a0Wikimedia", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 13}

Purse.io, the escrow service that connects users with bitcoin to users with Amazon gift cards, saw a significant amount of growth leading up to the big day.\n\u201cWe had the highest number of new users in a single week,\u201d Andrew Lee, CEO of Purse, said in an interview with\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0There were a total of 2,145 new users during the week.\nHowever, the people weren\u2019t just signing up and then forgetting about the website. Instead, they were actively participating on the site, purchasing goods. What surprised the team, though, was that it wasn\u2019t just prime purchases that people were making.\n\u201cThere was a lot of hype around the Prime Day event, but when we look at the specific orders, users didn\u2019t just order necessarily prime deals but whatever they needed to buy,\u201d Lee told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine.\nAll told, Prime Day was a success for Purse. During the week, there were a total of 1,050 total transactions made on the site. On Prime Day itself, approximately $24,000 was spent on the site.\nHow Purse.io Works\n\u00a0One of the benefits of bitcoin is that it is money for the Internet. The problem for many users is that Amazon does not yet accept it. Purse enables a trusted exchange where a user with gift cards is able to exchange the value on those cards for bitcoin.\nAnd there is a lot of available money on gift cards. According to a\u00a0New York Post article, $44 billion has been left unused on gift cards since 2008. And that number is continuing to grow. There are billions of dollars of unused Amazon gift cards.\nPurse enables the user to sell their gift cards for bitcoin, usually at a discount anywhere from 5 percent to 50 percent. These gift-card holders buy an item for the bitcoin holder. The bitcoin is then held in escrow, and when the purchase is completed and the item is delivered, the bitcoin is released to the gift-card holder.\nPurse has become quite a success among bitcoin users. According to Lee, more than $500,000 is transacted on the website each month, with more than 45,000 users spending more than $2 million through the site over the past year.\nPurse Going Forward\nPurse\u00a0announced Tuesday\u00a0a series of changes to its platform, including a complete redesign and a new shopping cart to enable the easy addition and removal of items. These moves are an effort to increase the likelihood that people will use bitcoin to make purchases.\n\u201cBitcoin commerce needs to make economic sense for everyone involved in a transaction. It\u2019s only a matter of time before we see large retailers, such as Expedia or Overstock, exit Bitcoin. They have already cited low usage,\u201d said Lee in\u00a0a blog post\u00a0titled\u00a0Bitcoin Commerce is Broken.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll be introducing solutions [that] will allow consumers to spend bitcoins at any merchant with a discount, and a whole lot more.\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 7, "day": 29}

Varoufakis is not impressed by bitcoin as a currency, but he is persuaded that its underlying technology could be put to effective use in troubled economies.\nIn a teleconference call with international financial operators, Varoufakis claimed to have been given the OK by Tsipras to plan a payment system that could operate in euros but which could be changed into drachmas \u201covernight\u201d if necessary, according to\u00a0Kathimerini\u00a0\u2018s interpretation.\u00a0Kathimerini\u00a0obtained a transcript of the call, which took place on July 16, a week after Varoufakis\u2019 resignation.\nThe planned parallel payment system would launch if banks were forced to close and would allow payments to be made between third parties and the state. The plan\u2019s implementation would require the tax registration numbers of taxpayers, available from the General Secretariat of Public Revenues website, which is monitored by Greece\u2019s creditors.\n\u201cThe General Secretary of Public Revenues within my ministry is controlled fully and directly by the troika. It was not under control of my ministry, of me as minister; it was controlled by Brussels,\u201d said Varoufakis.\nThe plan required hacking into the system to get the taxpayer registration numbers. To avoid alerting Greece\u2019s creditors, which monitor the system, Varoufakis assigned a childhood friend of his, an information technology expert who became a professor at Columbia University, to perform the hack.\n\u201cI think the Greek people had authorized us to pursue energetically and vigorously that negotiation to the point of saying that if we can\u2019t have a viable agreement, then we should consider getting out,\u201d said Varoufakis in the call, referring to\u00a0the results\u00a0of the July 5 referendum in Greece.\n\u201cThe prime minister before he became P.M., before we won the election in January, had given me the green light to come up with a Plan B,\u201d said Varoufakis. \u201c[T]he difficulty was to go from the five people who were planning it to the 1,000 people that would have to implement it. For that I would have to receive another authorization which never came.\u201d\n\u201c[W]hen the time [for the authorization] came [Tsipras] realized that it was just too difficult,\u201d\u00a0Varoufakis told\u00a0The Telegraph. \u201cI don\u2019t know when he reached that decision. I only learned explicitly on the night of the referendum, and that is why I offered to resign.\u201d\nAccording to\u00a0The Telegraph, Varoufakis wanted to seize on the momentum of a landslide victory in the vote but was overruled.\nIn related news\u00a0reported\u00a0by\u00a0Reuters, former Greek Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis said he had urged the government to tap the reserves of the Bank of Greece in defiance of the European Central Bank and argued for a return to the drachma. \u201cThe main reason for that was for the Greek economy and Greek people to survive, which is the utmost duty every government has under the constitution,\u201d he said.\nThe most disturbing part of Varoufakis\u2019 call transcript is where the former finance minister hints at a plan to strip European countries of their financial sovereignty.\n\u201c[German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble] said explicitly to me that a Grexit is going to equip him with sufficient bargaining, sufficient terrorizing power in order to impose upon the French that which Paris has been resisting,\u201d said Varoufakis. \u201cAnd what is that?

(we now know it\u2019s July 29/30)\nHomestead \u2013 2 to 4 months\nMetropolis \u2013 4 to 8 months\nSerenity \u2013 6 to 12 months\nVirtual Machine upgrades \u2013 1 year, 2 months\nScalability \u2013 2 years\n\nEthereum launch \u2013 how it will happen\n\u00a0The launch of Ethereum will take place late July 29 into early July 30, depending on what part of the world you\u2019re in.\nThis will be the launch of the first component \u2013 \u201cFrontier\u201d \u2013 named after the American Wild West, where programmers will fight to survive in a relatively primitive and unexplored environment.\nIt is expected any day now, but\u00a0the Ethereum team, like NASA\u00a0before a shuttle launch, has missed some expected launch dates to ensure that all systems were well tested and coordinated before hitting the \u201con\u201d button.\nAnthony Di Iorio, Ethereum co-founder,\u00a0explained\u00a0that the Frontier stage, will be mainly for the developers.\n\u201cThe majority of focus and current goal of Ethereum is to get the tools into the hands of developers and to show them how they can create the products end users will eventually value,\u201d he said. \u201cLess time and resources have been spent explaining Ethereum to end consumers, enterprises, and institutions.\u201d\nBitcoin Magazine\u00a0asked Stephan Tual, chief communications officer for the Ethereum project, what kind of response they are expecting from developers on July 29/30. He explained:\n\u201cIn terms of users for Frontier, it\u2019s impossible to tell of course,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have 15K followers on Twitter, and receive about 100K page views on our website per month. Frontier is a very technical launch targeted at developers and we expect the user base to grow slowly from there.\u201d\nOn his\u00a0blog, Tual explains why the Ethereum launch is not really a launch at all:\n\u201cFrontier is now feature complete and its codebase has been frozen for two weeks. As a team we are currently reviewing the final steps for the release, not all of them technical. There will be no countdown \u2013 Ethereum is not something that\u2019s centrally \u2018launched,\u2019 but instead emerges from consensus. Users will have to voluntarily download and run a specific version of the software, then manually generate and load the Genesis block to join the official project\u2019s network.\u201d\nEthereum Crowdfunding\nDi Iorio was involved in the initial crowdfunding for Ethereum and told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine\u00a0that at the time, in September 2014, it was the most successful crowd sale in history (over $18 million USD was raised). Now it is still the third most successful of any crowdfunding venture to date.\n\u201cThe key with the crowdsale of ether was to make it available to as many people as possible and to build a global community,\u201d Di Iorio said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been about inclusiveness and considered the project a community-led effort.\u201d\nEther is the currency that goes with Ethereum, but unlike bitcoin, is not meant to be a general means of payment, but a specific funding device for the Ethereum project.\nEthereum has No Headquarters\nAlthough Toronto was the birthplace of Ethereum, it would be hard to say where the company\u2019s center is, and that\u2019s part of the plan to stay decentralized. There are members of the Ethereum team in Switzerland, London, Amsterdam, even Brazil.\nWhen Buterin was asked at DEC_TEC \u201cWhy do you do it?\u201d he said, \u201cTo make things better for people, simpler and easier to use.

Lombrozo is also a founding member of the CryptoCurrency Security Standards Steering Committee and has been a longtime contributor to the open source Bitcoin core development effort.\nIntroduction\nIn the last few months, a contentious debate has arisen surrounding the issue of a hardcoded constant in the consensus rules of the Bitcoin network. While on the surface it appears to be a simple enough change, this single issue has opened up a veritable Pandora\u2019s box.\nWhat is the block-size limit and why is it there?\nWhen the Bitcoin network was in infancy, several assumptions had to be made regarding what kind of computational resources a typical Bitcoin node would have. Among these resources were network bandwidth, storage space and processor speed. If blocks were allowed to grow too big they would swamp these resources, making it easy to attack the network or discourage people from running a node. On the other hand, if blocks were too small, network resources would be underutilized unnecessarily, keeping the number of transactions too low. Despite the fact that available computational resources vary widely between devices and computer technology continues to evolve, for the sake of simplicity, a size was chosen: one megabyte.\nIt all comes down to economics\nThe block size limit is, at its core, an economic decision. It balances transaction load with availability of computational resources to handle the load. Block space is subject to the same economic principles of supply and demand as any other scarce resource.\nIn the early days of the Bitcoin network, it was expected the transaction load would remain well below the proscribed limit for some time. However, it was anticipated that eventually blocks would fill up as more and more nodes joined the network.\nIn order to deal with resource scarcity, a transaction fee had already been introduced into the protocol design. The idea was that a fee market would naturally develop, with those wanting their transactions to get more highly prioritized for processing offering to pay higher fees. Until fees could sustain the network, an inflationary block reward subsidy which halves every 210,000 blocks (about once every four years) would provide incentive for miners to continue building blocks.\nThe problem is that there\u2019s sort of a chicken-and-egg situation inherent in this. As long as block space is abundant, there\u2019s little incentive to develop the proper infrastructure to accommodate a fee market. Until recently, most of this infrastructure has assumed abundance. Block space scarcity requires a significant change to how we propagate transactions. However, these problems are only now starting to get addressed as we start having to deal with scarcity.\nAs the block reward subsidy continues to decrease over time, fees will become more and more important as a means for paying for the network. Blockchains are expensive to maintain \u2013 and block space isn\u2019t free. Someone needs to foot the bill. Removing scarcity by increasing block size shifts the costs from transaction senders to validator nodes \u2013 the very nodes upon which we vitally depend for the continued secure operation of the network.\nBut isn\u2019t the block size limit about scalability?\nA major misconception that has arisen around this issue is that this is all about being able to scale up the network. Scalability is indeed a serious concern \u2013 recently there\u2019s been some significant progress in addressing this via noncustodial offchain payment channels, but it is tangential to this discussion and beyond the scope of this article. The block-size limit is about economics, not about scalability. Hopefully, we can clear up this misconception once and for all.\nIn computer systems, scalability is the property of a system to be able to continue to operate within design specifications as we increase the amount or size of data it must process. Since computational resources are finite, any real-world computer system has limits beyond which it will no longer behave desirably.\nA maximum block size was imposed on the Bitcoin network to make sure we never surpass this limit. Undesirable behavior isn\u2019t merely a matter of annoyance here \u2013 the security of the network itself is at stake. Surpassing the operational limit means the security model upon which the network was built can no longer be relied upon.\nOne of the assumptions in this security model is that it is reasonably cheap to validate transactions. Beyond a certain block size, the cost of transaction validation grows beyond what the honest nodes in the network can bear or are willing to bear. Without proper validation, no transaction can be considered secure.\nRaising the block size limit can only securely increase the number of transactions the network processes as long as the limit still remains below the point where validation starts to fail.\nCan\u2019t we make optimizations to the software to reduce validation cost?\nYes, we can. There are a number of areas that could still be improved; among them are block propagation mechanisms, compression or pruning of data, more efficient signature schemes, and stronger limits on operation counts. Many of these things are indeed good ideas and should be pursued. Everything else remaining equal, reducing the cost of validation can only improve the network\u2019s health. However, barring a major algorithmic breakthrough along with a substantial protocol redesign and/or a sudden acceleration of Moore\u2019s Law and Nielsen\u2019s Law, there\u2019s a hard theoretical limit to how much we can really do to reduce costs.\nEven given these optimizations, the computational cost of validation grows at a greater-than-linear rate with block size. Roughly, this means that multiplying the block size by X raises the cost of validating the block by a factor larger than X. We\u2019d still be many orders of magnitude shy of being able to satisfy global demand if we expect to include each of everyone\u2019s transactions in the blockchain and also expect the network to continue to function properly. Block space is inherently scarce.\nAt what point does validation start to fail?\nThere is strong evidence we\u2019re quickly nearing this point if we haven\u2019t already passed it. The computational cost of validation is increasing at a far faster rate right now than the cost of computational resources is decreasing. In addition to the superlinear complexity inherent in the protocol, the protocol design has two fateful errors that further compound the problem: It assumes miners will properly validate blocks and that clients will be able to easily obtain reasonably secure, short proofs for their transactions that they can check for themselves.\nBut don\u2019t miners validate blocks?\nSometimes. That\u2019s the first error. They have at least some incentive to do so. However, miners don\u2019t get paid to validate blocks. They get paid for finding nonces that make blocks hash within a target, aka proof-of-work. It doesn\u2019t really matter who validates the blocks they build upon. They do lose their rewards if their own block is invalid or they mine atop an invalid block, but as long as those who are feeding them blocks almost always feed them valid blocks, it can actually be rational to cut corners on validation to save costs. The occasional invalid block might statistically be more than offset by the cuts in nominal operational expenses. This scenario has something of a tragedy of the commons element to it.\nParticularly costly for miners is propagation latency. The longer it takes them to receive, validate, and propagate a new block, the higher the chance someone else will beat them to it. Also costly for miners are maintenance and support for validation nodes to make sure they correctly adhere to the consensus rules. Then there\u2019s the actual cost of the computational resources required to run the node. And even if the miner is willing to incur all these costs, a software bug could still cause them to mine an invalid block. And all the above would be true even without adding mining pools to the picture, which greatly amplify validation errors.\nThese concerns are not merely hypothetical musings. This scenario has already come to pass. Around July 4, 2015, a network fork occurred exactly for these reasons, which caused many clients, websites and online services to accept invalid blocks. Rather than putting up with the costs of validation themselves, they were relying on the miners to validate for them\u2026and the miners themselves were not validating. The costlier validation is, the more likely such scenarios become.\nUnfortunately, the protocol currently lacks a means to directly compensate validators securely. If we could do this it would likely lead to a much more robust and secure economic model.\nWhy can\u2019t clients validate the blocks themselves?\nWhile the resource requirements to run a full validation node are still within the capabilities of modern servers, they have greatly surpassed the capabilities of smaller devices, particularly mobile devices with intermittent or restricted network connections. Even most desktop and laptop systems are already heavily taxed by having to validate one megabyte blocks \u2013 and the need to run one\u2019s own validation node greatly degrades the end-user experience.\nThe second fateful error in the protocol design is the assumption that despite it not being practical for most users to run a full validation node, they\u2019d still be able to request from other nodes reasonably secure, short proofs that the blocks and transactions they\u2019ve received are valid. But a satisfactory mechanism for this has so far failed to materialize. This issue is greatly exacerbated when miners also fail to do proper validation. Instead, most clients are currently relying on centralized services to perform the validation for them \u2013 and sadly, the July 4, 2015 fork demonstrated that even with good intentions, these centralized services cannot be counted upon to always properly validate either.\nWhat can we do about all this?\nLike it or not, the era of block space abundance is coming to an end. Even if after addressing all the above concerns we agreed it was safe to raise the size limit, sooner or later we\u2019ll bump up against the new limit\u2026probably sooner rather than later. And if we raise it without carefully addressing the above concerns as well as the enormous risk associated with incompatible changes to consensus rules, we risk nothing short of a collapse of the network security model, making the issue of block size moot.\nRegardless of whether \u2013 and when \u2013 we ultimately end up increasing the block size limit, we are already dealing with scarcity. Nodes that relay transactions on the network are already being forced to prioritize them to reduce memory load and avoid denial-of-service attacks. Spam attacks are already causing some blocks to fill up. A fee market is already starting to develop. I trust human ingenuity to find a good way forward presented with these challenges.\nRegarding validation costs, I\u2019m hopeful that eventually we\u2019ll be able to make it cheap and efficient for everyone to properly validate \u2013 or at worst, develop mechanisms for securely outsourcing and enforcing validation. This will require substantial reengineering of the protocol \u2013 and perhaps of the Internet itself. Even if this is still a few years off, given all the major developments occurring in this space I believe it will eventually happen. For now, I would strongly urge caution when doing anything that further increases validation costs.\n\u00a0\nPhoto\u00a0Tiger Pixel\u00a0/\u00a0Flickr", "year": 2015, "month": 7, "day": 29}

They led discussions on using the blockchain for fraud-free voting, storage of identities, response to natural disasters and a public ledger of properties such as land.\nOther speakers, including Chelsea Barabas, Ann Kim, Ryan Shea and Peter Kirby, focused on introducing the blockchain\u2019s capability to decrease the amount of money spent annually on identity theft and records.\nCivic Infrastructure\nKim, from international design and consulting firm IDEO, introduced the idea of frictionless transfer, wherein people around the world could donate small amounts of bitcoin for day-to-day tasks or to fund public/nonprofit organizations.\nThis summer, IDEO hosted a thematic incubator called Bits + Blocks Lab focusing on trust, transactions and participation. Six teams and 25 design entrepreneurs worked together to create various prototypes targeting different applications of the blockchain. Some of the prototypes on frictionless transactions included donation tug of war and image unlocking app through donation.\nThe main application that these teams and IDEO have looked into is creating a transparent voting/complaint system to develop more efficient civic infrastructure. Kim proposed that by using the bitcoin blockchain, citizens will be able to instantly report on improvements needed for public infrastructure and match government funds to allocate budgets accordingly.\nThis digital interaction between citizens and the government will create a transparent and unforgeable request-recovery system for public infrastructure. Furthermore, citizens would be able to track public funds of cities and even countries to check whether government funds are being allocated properly, and whether the budget is being distributed to various projects.\nKim introduced an idea called The Dandelion, which was proposed by Princeton University students who identified a park that needed a playground structure.\n\u201cStudents planted a Dandelion with petals that have addresses on them. As people donate small amounts of money, the image of the playground started filling in, and the very block was being visualized,\u201d explained Kim.\n\nBlockchain for Identity Storage\nBitcoin blockchain-based passcard identity Startup Onename co-founder and CEO Ryan Shea led the discussion on how blockchain could be used to store identity and solve identity problems.\n\u201cThere are billions of people around the world that do not have access to government-issued I.D. documents. This includes 25 percent of African-Americans in the U.S., hundreds of millions in India and refugees around the world,\u201d Shea said. This is the result of the inefficient manual operation of governments and includes a long list of places where identification is needed, such as bank accounts, housing, government benefits and voting, he said.\nAll government identifications, such as passports and driver licenses, currently are delivered in a physical form. They are all printed, laminated, sealed and covered manually, which requires a lot of human labor and money to sustain.\n\u201cApproximately $25 billion (USD) are lost annually due to identity theft,\u201d Shea said. \u201cThat\u2019s because we don\u2019t have a very good way of authenticating who you are, and relying on these physical documents and personal identifiable information.\u201d\nThe blockchain, however, allows anyone to record data on transactions, which is unforgeable and transparent. Therefore, it is cost-efficient and time-saving for both the producers and the citizens.\nFor example, if a person were asked to show his personal identification documents in the middle of the street and the information is stored on the blockchain, he/she can simply go onto a platform that decodes blockchain information and show the identification quickly.\n\u00a0\nPhotos courtesy of\u00a0Digital Currency Group Inc.

How can a company meet those expectations to stay out of trouble with DOJ, or at least mitigate the effects of any criminal inquiry on it as well as its executives, employees and investors? A recent speech by the Criminal Division head, Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell, provides critical guidance on DOJ\u2019s \u201capproach to the emerging virtual currency landscape\u201d and expands on its view that \u201ccompliance and cooperation from exchanges, companies and other market actors can ensure that emerging technologies are not misused to fund and facilitate illicit activities.\u201d[1]\nDOJ\u2019s View of How Virtual Currencies Are Used\nDOJ is skeptical. While it knows virtual currency has \u201cmany legitimate actual and potential uses,\u201d its enforcement stance is informed by the observation that \u201cthe inherent features of virtual currencies are exactly what make them attractive to criminals.\u201d[2]\u00a0For instance, virtual currency systems \u201cconduct transfers quickly, securely and with a perceived level of anonymity,\u201d have an \u201cirreversibility of payments made in virtual currency and lack of oversight by a central financial authority\u201d and have the \u201cability to conduct international peer-to-peer transactions that lack immediately available personally identifiable information.\u201d\nVirtual currency thus \u201cfacilitates a wide range of traditional criminal activities as well as sophisticated cybercrime schemes.\u201d[3]\u00a0For instance, \u201conline black markets\u201d on the dark web offer a \u201cwide selection of illicit goods and services\u201d paid for in virtual currency, including \u201cmore traditional crimes such as narcotics trafficking, stolen credit card information, and hit-men for hire.\u201d But there has also been \u201ca significant evolution in criminal activity.\u201d Virtual currency has funded \u201cthe production of child exploitation material through online crowd-sourcing.\u201d It has been used to \u201cbuy and sell lethal toxins over the Internet,\u201d to make payments in \u201cvirtual kidnapping and extortion\u201d and to allow \u201cnear-instantaneous transactions across the globe between perpetrators of phishing and hacking schemes and their victims.\u201d\nVirtual Currency Businesses as Financial System Gatekeepers\u00a0\nDOJ views these issues as a relatively small-scale problem now, because \u201c[f]ew virtual systems currently can accommodate\u201d the sort of \u201clarge-scale money laundering schemes involving government-issued currency.\u201d But \u201cas virtual currencies become more mature and better understood by criminals,\u201d DOJ expects \u201can increase in both individualized criminal activity and large-scale money laundering enterprises.\u201d[4]\nThis means \u201ccompanies and individuals operating in the virtual currency ecosystem are at a crossroads.\u201d This is their chance \u201cto help virtual currency emerge from its association with criminal activities.\u201d But in order to \u201censure the integrity of this ecosystem and prevent its penetration by crime, the industry must raise the level of its game on the compliance front.\u201d\nThe government is thus enlisting this emerging business community as financial system gatekeepers. DOJ often notes that the country\u2019s banks \u201care our first line of defense against fraud, money laundering, terrorism financing and violations of sanctions laws.\u201d[5]\u00a0It expects nothing less here: \u201cVirtual currency exchangers and other marketplace actors comprise the front line of defense against money laundering and financial crime.\u201d[6]\nAnd DOJ is not kidding. AAG Caldwell bluntly says, \u201cindustry participants are now on notice that criminals \u2026 make regular use of\u201d virtual currencies. Robust compliance programs in virtual currency businesses are thus \u201cessential to keeping crime out of our financial system.\u201d At a minimum, raising \u201cthe level of its game\u201d will require the industry to exhibit \u201cstrict compliance with money services business regulations and anti-money laundering statutes.\u201d\nThe Costs of Compliance\u2014and of Noncompliance\nDOJ expects virtual currency businesses \u201cto take compliance risk as seriously as they take other business risk.\u201d And they must think about compliance broadly. On other occasions, AAG Caldwell has noted that compliance efforts \u201care too often behind the curve\u201d and fail to \u201cprevent tomorrow\u2019s scandals\u201d because they \u201ctarget the risk of regulatory or law enforcement exposure of institutional and employee misconduct, rather than the risk of the misconduct itself.\u201d[7]\u00a0DOJ wants the focus to be on the broader \u201ccompliance risk\u201d and not the narrower regulatory risk.\nWhat about the cost? DOJ \u201crecognize[s] that new entrants in emerging fields may find that compliance requires a significant expenditure of resources\u201d and promises to be \u201ccontext\u2011specific\u201d in analyzing the adequacy of compliance frameworks.[8]Nevertheless, \u201ca real commitment to compliance is a must, particularly given the significant risks in the virtual currency market.\u201d The bottom line: \u201cIn the long run, investment in effective compliance programs will be well worth it, especially in the event a company has to interact with law enforcement.\u201d\nThat \u201cinteraction\u201d with law enforcement may well involve DOJ deciding whether to indict a company (and individuals) or give it some kind of break. As AAG Caldwell says, \u201c[i]f a money services business finds itself subject to a criminal investigation,\u201d DOJ will look to the so-called Filip factors in its Principles of Prosecution of Business Organizations. In particular, it will examine \u201cthe existence of an effective and well-designed compliance program\u201d (Filip factor 5) and \u201ca company\u2019s remedial actions, including steps to improve upon an existing compliance program\u201d (Filip factor 6).\nAs for Filip factor 5, \u201ceffective anti-money laundering and other compliance programs must be tailored to meet the circumstances, size, structure and risks encountered\u201d by the business. For instance, \u201cvirtual currencies, with their perceived anonymity, pose risks that money transmitters such as Western Union do not face.\u201d The risks in the virtual currency arena may be difficult to deal with, but DOJ\u2019s view is simple: \u201cIndustry participants must address those risks, even when it may be costly to do so.\u201d Filip factor 6 requires that a company fix a problem if one occurs. That means not only that it must patch any hole in the compliance program, but also \u201creplace responsible management,\u201d \u201cdiscipline or terminate wrongdoers,\u201d \u201cpay restitution,\u201d and \u201ccooperate with the relevant government agencies.\u201d[9]\nRecommendations\nHere are some specific steps for emerging virtual currency businesses to consider when ensuring their compliance efforts align with DOJ\u2019s guidance and expectations:\nIt\u2019s Never Too Early.\u00a0Anticipate compliance issues as soon as possible in the company\u2019s lifecycle. Develop a compliance system at the same time that you are refining your product or service (and well before you interact with customers).\nPeople, People, People.\u00a0It\u2019s hard to understand cryptocurrencies, and even harder to explain them well to skeptical law enforcement personnel. Make excellent compliance people part of your initial team and include them in important decision-making.\nMoney, Money, Money.\u00a0There must be the financial commitment to compliance that is required in this industry space. While DOJ seems sympathetic to the \u201csignificant expenditure of resources,\u201d it will not likely go easy on those whom it concludes have skimped.\nThink About the Technology\u2019s Regulatory Future.\u00a0The technology of, and related to, your virtual currency will shape the government\u2019s expectations. Take bitcoin for example. Unlike dollar bills, say, every bitcoin carries its own transaction history. The blockchain is a public ledger of all bitcoin transactions. And new products are being refined that can analyze that blockchain and seek to determine every place a bitcoin has been and perhaps even who transferred or held it. It may become possible to give bitcoin a risk score, since those of suspicious provenance (for instance, those having once been through a mixer or in a dark wallet) could be separated from those that are squeaky clean.\nInstill a High-Integrity Culture Now for the Company You Will Become.\u00a0The government has high expectations for those it views as running \u201cgatekeeper\u201d businesses. The regulatory bar is bound to get even higher as large banks and financial institutions \u2014 with their established and highly professional compliance staffs \u2014 develop their own virtual currencies. As \u201cgatekeeper\u201d businesses grow, they face pressures to be \u201cethical\u201d and not simply to meet legal and regulatory minimums. Adopt a broad view of compliance risk that focuses on the risk of misconduct and on reputational risk and then communicate that view clearly and compellingly in the onboarding process.\nConclusion\nEmerging virtual currency businesses will face progressively higher compliance expectations from DOJ. They can maximize their potential market value by acting early in their lifecycles to install compliance systems and instill a high-integrity culture that will enable them to meet those expectations.\n\u00a0\n[1]\u00a0Assistant Attorney General Leslie R.

In fact, the Bitcoin blockchain represents the first solid, working implementation of distributed consensus \u2013 for the first time, everyone can agree on what transactions took place, and who owns what, because everything is recorded on a tamper-proof public ledger that doesn\u2019t need a central server and can\u2019t be controlled by any central authority.\nOf course, that is precisely the reason why the authorities and the banks don\u2019t like Bitcoin. Today, governments and financial institutions recognize that the blockchain technology behind Bitcoin can offer huge cost savings, efficiency, and operational benefits to financial systems \u2013 distributed ledger technology could save banks $15 billion-$20 billion per annum by 2022 according to\u00a0a recent Santander Innoventures report\u00a0\u2013 but it\u2019s in the nature of power to oppose what it can\u2019t control.\nThe two Accenture representatives offer their solution: \u201cTo be used by financial institutions, including capital markets firms and insurers, blockchains must supplant the costly methods introduced by bitcoin with a mechanism that guarantees security, privacy and speed without paying for anonymous consensus.\u201d\nIn other words, Bitcoin should disappear and be replaced by a closed blockchain. The new blockchain proposed by the Accenture writers is not \u201cpermissionless\u201d like the Bitcoin blockchain, where everyone can download the software and participate without asking anyone\u2019s permission, but a \u201cpermissioned\u201d blockchain restricted to vetted participants.\nNew York Times\u00a0technology and finance reporter Nathaniel Popper, author of\u00a0\u201cDigital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money,\u201d\u00a0noted\u00a0that a permissioned blockchain could be jointly run by the computers of the largest banks and serve as the backbone for a new, instant payment system without a single point of failure. The new blockchain, decentralized but closed, would offer the benefits of the current Bitcoin network without relying on end-users for its operations.\nOf course, the governments and the banks tend to enthusiastically support the idea of a permissioned blockchain without the troublesome bitcoin. But the Bitcoin system works, and the features that the Accenture writers propose to eliminate could be the very features that make it work. Other solutions to the issues mentioned by the Accenture writers, for example\u00a0Lightning Networks, could be more effective.\n\nPhoto\u00a0Michael Gray\u00a0/\u00a0Flickr\u00a0", "year": 2015, "month": 7, "day": 31}

It operates a network of more than 1,700 branches and outlets (including subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures) across more than 70 countries and employs around 87,000 people.\nPatwardhan has 25 years of banking experience, with Standard Chartered and Citibank, in regional and global roles in Credit Risk and Operational Risk Management. She is an IBF distinguished fellow, the highest banking accolade in Singapore, and a fellow of Singapore Management.\nFinextra\u00a0notes that\u00a0Citi,\u00a0UBS\u00a0and\u00a0Barclays\u00a0all have recently confirmed that they are exploring the blockchain, while a\u00a0BNP Paribas\u00a0analyst speculated that the distributed ledger has the potential to completely upend post-trade infrastructure.\nWriting on Linkedin, Patwardhan proposes\u00a0that Bitcoin could be a disruptive force for good. The financial services industry is being disrupted and digitally re-imagined, and some of the disruptors, who are working to revolutionize current business models from the ground up, could become mainstream.\n\u201cBitcoin has been viewed uneasily as an exotic alternative currency,\u201d notes Patwardhan. \u201cBut the banking industry is starting to see the many potential benefits of its underlying technology. For banks, the blockchain has the potential to become a technology model for a low-cost and transparent transaction infrastructure.\u201d\nPatwardhan is persuaded that the technology of Bitcoin could permit drastically reducing the price of financial services to the benefit of consumers, and be adopted to make financial transactions more secure and traceable for banks and regulators.\nOf course, Standard Chartered and other financial institutions must comply with regulations (anti-money laundering, know-your-customer, etc.) and make sure that their financial technology systems aren\u2019t used to fund undesirable activities. Of course, Patwardhan mentions drug trade or terrorism, like all banks and financial service providers are doing these days, although some restrictive regulations seem rather aimed at keeping peaceful, law-abiding citizens and business under constant surveillance.\nThe reason why the regulatory authorities and world of mainstream finance are warming up to the emerging blockchain-based fintech is that, contrary to na\u00efve perceptions, bitcoin transactions are not anonymous. Every transaction and the full transaction history of any bitcoin address are permanently recorded in the tamper-proof public blockchain, and therefore open to analysis and often more easily traceable than traditional transactions (let alone paper cash transactions).\nTherefore, \u201csanitized\u201d implementations of blockchain fintech could become useful tools for the authorities to fight crime, as well as any activity that they find undesirable. With the use of blockchain technology, says Patwardhan, transactions can be fully recorded and traced, making the ultimate destination and use of the funds clearer.\n\u201cWhether cryptocurrencies, the likes of Bitcoin, will fail or succeed remains to be seen,\u201d concludes Patwardhan. \u201cBut if they do take off, it is not impossible to imagine a scenario where even the central banks themselves might look at issuing digital currencies. No bank can afford to ignore what it augurs for the ongoing avalanche of digital innovations to come.\u201d\nPhoto\u00a0Tomkasing\u00a0/ CC BY-SA 3.0", "year": 2015, "month": 7, "day": 16}

Greg Abbott signed into law HB 483, paving the way for Texas to repatriate $1 billion in gold from an underground vault in Manhattan operated by HSBC bank, bringing it home to be stored in a yet-to-be-built Texas Bullion Depository,\u00a0reports\u00a0HNGN, which also speculated whether this is the first step in Texas\u2019 plan to secede. The gold is owned by the University of Texas\u2019 endowment fund.\n\u201cToday I signed HB 483 to provide a secure facility for the State of Texas, state agencies and Texas citizens to store gold bullion and other precious metals,\u201dAbbott said in an official statement in June. \u201cWith the passage of this bill, the Texas Bullion Depository will become the first state-level facility of its kind in the nation, increasing the security and stability of our gold reserves and\u00a0keeping taxpayer funds from leaving Texas to pay for fees to store gold in facilities outside our state.\u201d\nRep. Giovanni Capriglione, the author and sponsor of the bill, recently appeared on the\u00a0Trunews\u00a0talk show to speak with host\u00a0Rick Wiles\u00a0about what the legislation could mean for Texas.\n\u201cThe really interesting part about this depository, which hasn\u2019t been getting a lot of press,\u201d said Capriglione as\u00a0reported\u00a0by\u00a0Texas Observer, is that \u201cwith this depository, private individuals and entities will be able to purchase goods, and will be able to use assets in the vault the same way you\u2019d be able to use cash.\u201d\nThe Texas Bullion Depository \u2013 basically a private currency backed by gold just like old-time currencies \u2013 is, according to the show host, \u201cthe biggest threat in 102 years to the Federal Reserve System.\u201d Capriglione agrees that it could very well make the Federal Reserve System unnecessary.\n\u201cThe federal government can sue all they want, and I hope they don\u2019t because I think they will lose,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Capriglione in June, adding that Texas is on good solid legal ground to create the depository and operate it as stated in the bill. \u201cThere is a motto in the office of almost every state legislator in Texas, and it\u2019s a flag that we have [from the Texas Revolution], it\u2019s below a cannon and what the motto says is, \u2018Come and Take It\u2019,\u201d he said.\nSome observers read this story as an example of extreme anti-federal libertarianism and relate it to questionable political positions on other issues. On the other hand, as\u00a0recent events in Europe\u00a0show, many people throughout the world don\u2019t trust their governments much and want to explore alternative forms of economy, including, of course, bitcoin.\nIn reply to a question on the possibility of \u201ca Texas-style bitcoin,\u201d Capriglione said \u201cOK! That would be awesome, too. I personally own bitcoin. You could make transactions with bitcoin, use the gold depository as a medium, and then make payments on the other side.\u201d\nIt isn\u2019t clear what that means exactly. The concept of bitcoin backed by gold doesn\u2019t seem to make too much sense, however, several alternative digital currencies that are backed in gold do exist. Instead, it seems likely that Capriglione refers to the possibility of using bitcoin to purchase gold held in the Texas Bullion Depository, and to sell the gold back for bitcoin.", "year": 2015, "month": 7, "day": 18}

Prior to joining Redpoint, he was a project manager at Google working on AdSense. Before Google, Tunguz worked as a Java engineer at Appian Corporation, building tools for the Department of Homeland Security and co-founded a SaaS startup building software for law firms.\nIn the list of fastest-growing sectors, Bitcoin is followed by photo-sharing and physical storage (which includes moving and self-storage companies). Each year, starting in mid-2012 through mid-2015, these three sectors have grown their total investment dollars by more than 145 percent, according to data from Mattermark.\nThese fastest-growing sectors are relatively underfunded at the moment.\u00a0\u00a0While Bitcoin startups receive less than 0.2 percent of the startup funding pie, and physical storage startups less then 0.1 percent, transportation and hospitality startups \u2013 fueled by the spectacular success of Uber and AirBNB \u2013 each receive more than 6 percent of the total amount of startup funding. Other well-funded sectors are travel, banking, and space.\nBut the fact that Bitcoin is, at the same time, a relatively underfunded sector and the fastest growing sector means that there are huge opportunities for innovative Bitcoin startups.\nBesides the fast-growing sectors, Tunguz lists less successful ones with negative growth. Semiconductor investment fell 31 percent per year, email startups raised 22 percent less, and dating contracted by 9 percent annually.\nThe worst performing sector is deal sites, where the funding raised fell by 48 percent per year. That can be explained by noting that the sector of deal sites is dominated by one very successful player \u2013 Groupon \u2013 and, therefore, investors don\u2019t think there is enough room for new players. Similarly, semiconductor startups must compete with giants such as Intel, which can afford burning lots of money in pursuit of innovation, which may scare investors off.\nTunguz concludes that startup founders will move to areas with less competition, and investors will seek under-explored areas to finance, looking for great returns. That seems to be the case for the relatively underfunded, fast growing sector of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, which is beginning to see a lot of investments from venture capitalists and institutional players alike.\nIn fact, major financial players such as\u00a0Citi,\u00a0UBS\u00a0and\u00a0Barclays\u00a0all have recently confirmed that they are exploring the blockchain, while a\u00a0BNP Paribas\u00a0analyst speculated that the distributed ledger has the potential to completely upend post-trade infrastructure.\u00a0Financial blockchain applications will be measured in the trillions, said top financial star Blythe Masters at Exponential Finance 2015.\nSantander InnoVentures and other financial firms\u00a0launched\u00a0\u201ca call to action to banks, financial institutions and financial technology (fintech) businesses to work together to undertake a fundamental \u2018reboot\u2019 of the core processes, systems and infrastructure of the banking industry.\u201d\nAccording to their report \u201cThe Fintech 2.0 Paper: Rebooting financial services,\u201d blockchain-based technology could save banks $15 billion-$20 billion per year by 2022.", "year": 2015, "month": 7, "day": 20}

This system, known as DIONS (Decentralized I/O Name Server) will utilize the I/O Digital blockchain to\u00a0attach sensitive identity credentials\u00a0to a specific Bitcoin (XBT) or I/O Coin (IOC) address.\nThe system allows for the registration of aliases, avatars, documents, making them fully transferable between users. DIONS will offer strong security by integrating a fully fledged RSA cryptosystem (using a 2048 bits long key).\nDIONS will support a decentralized messaging system. The system will enable fast, easy and secure communication between users. Not only will users be able to send encrypted private messages, they will also have the option to broadcast messages to the wider world via a decentralized\u00a0Twitter-esque micro-blogging service. This service could also be used as a\u00a0\u201creddit\u201d\u00a0like service, that could revolutionize the centralized service, into the first one of a kind decentralized\u00a0blogging service.\nBusinesses, as well as being able to make use of their own brand names, can now use unique IDs to serve as a customer, invoice, or reference numbers (e.g. HSBC:8008135). This provides a more familiar format for customers more accustomed to the naming conventions of email. It also allows businesses to benefit from vastly reduced fees and the robustness and easy auditability of a decentralized distributed database.\nI/O Digital\u2019s Blockchain also aims at servicing holders of intellectual property, rights management, certificates of authenticity and condition reports. A hash value included in an I/O transaction can serve as Proof of Existence for any digital file, be it a legal document, an application\u2019s source code, artwork or a piece of music. The timestamp of the block that the hash value is included in, becomes a timestamp of the file itself, creating immutable proof that it existed in that form at that particular moment in time.\nI/O Digital is also departing from the normal Bitcoin QT wallet. The team has developed the first full HTML5 cryptocurrency wallet in the world, that doesn\u2019t use the classic Bitcoin-QT wallet. Allowing for a more user friendly front end and a more versatile wallet system.\nHow will I/O Digital deal with data bloat?\nTo alleviate data bloat and to enable bitcoin users the ability to use DIONS, I/O Digital introduced a Project Codename \u201cI/O Chameleon\u201d. Developed over a twelve-month period, I/O Chameleon is a framework which will allow for the creation of any number of unique and interoperable I/O Digital sidechains. These auxiliary blockchains will each have unique properties suited to the particular set of services and applications that they will support. This network of blockchains, or \u201csuperchain\u201d, will afford unparalleled flexibility to I/O users, allowing any of a number of configurations and features to be seamlessly adopted depending on the use case.\nThe framework itself will collate data from the various chains and allow the application of generic control policies via an extensive high level API. For end users this means access to the full range of I/O Digital functions, applications and services from a single interface \u2013 a web front end from which to easily manage an array of advanced decentralized applications.\nThough the blockchains comprising the Chameleon network will initially be limited to I/O Sidechains, they will incorporate a 2-way Peg to the Bitcoin Blockchain, that will allow Bitcoin users the ability to use the DIONS system. In the near future, it will be technically possible to include other projects, should another project develop an especially secure, useful feature or application, the development team with consensus from the community, may choose to integrate it into Chameleon so that I/O Coin and Bitcoin users may also benefit from it.\nI/O Coin was founded in July 2014 by Joel Bosch, the CEO of an Apple IT Services company, with over 10 years experience in Management IT Services. with an idea and vision to create a legitimate cryptocurrency focusing on user friendly applications. As the blockchain project progressed, I/O Digital was branded as the umbrella for various applications and their focus is to provide advanced blockchain services to individuals and companies interested in the economic and security benefits offered. I/O Digital\u2019s core development team is fully transparent. The team is led by\u00a0Joel Bosh, Lead Developer Derek Hatton, POS Security & Systems Management Sam Gabsi, HTML5 Wallet Developer Pat Smuk and Community \u00a0& Investor Relations Richard Groen.\nI/O Digital is not just a cryptocurrency, but an entire blockchain based decentralized application development project, built out on I/O Coin\u2019s blockchain.

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nThe confusing, user-unfriendly format of Bitcoin addresses has turned off many possible new users in the past, but\u00a0Onename\u00a0has been working on a solution to this ease-of-use issue for quite some time. Although the ability to link a Bitcoin address to a Onename username has been available for a while now, a\u00a0newly released API\u00a0will allow bitcoin users to share one easy-to-understand name with their friends and work colleagues.\nPrivacy Concerns Remain\nAlthough Onename allows users to map their username to a static Bitcoin address, there are a few issues with the current setup.\u00a0Reusing addresses\u00a0is known to be bad for privacy in Bitcoin, and not many knowledgeable bitcoin users want to move to a system that will publicly broadcast all of their transactions for the world to see. While it\u2019s true that all bitcoin transactions are technically public, using Onename would make it trivial for another party to track all of an individual\u2019s financial activity \u2013 or at least the transactions that used the Onename alias.\nA Possible Solution with BIP47\nOn Reddit, Onename co-founder Ryan Shea recently commented about a possible solution to this privacy problem:\n\n\nAlthough\u00a0stealth addresses\u00a0have been viewed as the proper solution for Bitcoin alias privacy in the past, it appears that Shea sees\u00a0reusable payment codes\u00a0as a better option.\u00a0The Open Bitcoin Privacy Project\u2019s\u00a0Justus Ranvier\u00a0describes reusable payment codes as follows:\n\u201cPayment codes are SPV-friendly alternatives to DarkWallet-style stealth addresses which provide useful features such as positively identifying senders to recipients and automatically providing for transaction refunds.\u201d\nAs Ranvier explained in a\u00a0recent Reddit post, one of the downsides of reusable payment codes is they do not currently support\u00a0multi-signature\u00a0functionality. It\u2019s possible that multi-party ownership over payment codes will be possible in the future through the use of\u00a0threshold signatures; but there is still research to complete in this area.\nOn the other hand, payment codes have the benefit of enabling \u201cfrom address\u201d functionality in Bitcoin. This makes it much easier to send payments to bitcoin users who have already interacted with each other in the past, especially in the case of refunds.\nWhether people are using aliases or not, it\u2019s clear that privacy concerns are not being ignored by Onename or the rest of the Bitcoin development community. Another startup,\u00a0Netki, is also looking at solving the privacy problem associated with Bitcoin aliases, although their solution uses a combination of\u00a0HD wallets and Payment Requests.\nUse in Decentralized Applications\nIn addition to using Onename in Bitcoin wallets as an alternative to long, convoluted addresses, the platform can be also useful for establishing usernames on decentralized applications. For example,\u00a0OpenBazaar\u00a0could eventually integrate Onename into its decentralized marketplace platform to allow users to build reputation over time. Having a reusable payment code attached to a\u00a0Namecoin-based\u00a0username would be a move in the right direction for the OpenBazaar system.\n\u00a0\nPhoto\u00a0Fingerprint\u00a0/\u00a0Photopin\u00a0", "year": 2015, "month": 7, "day": 7}

With the help of Bitreserve, Bitwage has introduced a new product, Bitwage Cloud Savings, which enables employees to store their payments in \u201c9 currencies and 4 precious metals, including US dollars, Bitcoins, Euros, Pounds, Mexican Pesos, Indian Rupees, Gold, and Silver.\u201d\nBitwage Founder and COO Jonathan Chester announced in a blog post:\nFrom paycheck to paycheck, Bitwage users will be able to decide exactly how their salary is paid. Whether you are an Argentinian contractor wishing to hold US Dollars, a Russian software developer looking to hold Euros or a US employee who wants to be paid in a split between Bitcoin, Gold and Dollars, Bitwage gives the choice back to you.\nThis is where Bitreserve Connect comes in, and where Bitwage makes an extraordinary leap forward. Earlier today, Bitwage announced a brand new product, Bitwage Cloud Savings. By integrating with Bitreserve, they are now offering their customers the freedom and flexibility to be paid not just in bitcoin, but in as many as 8 different currencies and 4 precious metals. Starting today, \u201cBitwage users will be able to decide exactly how their salary is paid.\nVolatility\nBitwage\u2019s new product and implementation of\u00a0Bitreserve\u2019s technology\u00a0solves the ultimate problem of employees and merchants: volatility.\nTim Parsa, Bitreserve CCO has explained that \u201cthose living paycheck-to-paycheck literally can\u2019t afford volatility, and no one at any financial level should have to accept the possibility of a significant and unexpected salary loss caused by bitcoin,\u201d especially in countries like Guatemala and Mexico, where he observed such inconvenience.\nHe said it \u201cmeans that for the unbanked and underbanked, there now exists a solution that allows them to participate in the global digital marketplace and avoid the slow, costly process of check-cashing services.\u201d\nThere are two main motivations behind the new feature says Jonathan Chester, COO of Bitwage. Chester explained further in an interview with\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cThe first is to encourage more bitcoin transactions.\u00a0 Through the Bitwage Cloud Savings service, users can receive their entire wages in bitcoin, without having to have their entire wage exposed to bitcoin volatility.\nThis makes it way easier for people to receive more of their wages in bitcoin.\u00a0 As you spend out of your Cloud Savings account, powered by Bitreserve, you are creating a bitcoin transaction.\u00a0 As we continue to grow the number of bitcoin transactions, the upward price trend will become less volatile.\u201d\nThe second motivation is related to international payrolls, he said.\u00a0 \u201cMost international employees, contractors and freelancers want all the efficiencies of bitcoin without having to deal with the volatility risk involved or with Bitcoin directly.\u00a0 This brings us one step closer to providing a solution that can be used for a global mainstream audience.\u201d\nChester also explained that places with high inflation and huge costs in both time and money for receiving wages are in need of a system like Bitwage Cloud Savings the most.\n\u201cArgentina is a great example of where all three of these aspects intersect,\u201d he said. \u201cEmployees and contractors often lose between 30 percent and 40 percent of their wages when sent from abroad just to hold the funds in a currency which had 40 percent inflation in 2014.\u201d\nThere are also countries with just a few of these aspects, such as Greece and Brazil, he said.\n\u201cIn Greece, inaccessibility is a real issue.\u00a0 Many people are afraid they won\u2019t be have money soon.\u00a0 Being able to hold your funds in a currency you trust in the cloud instead of a bank in Greece which is likely to freeze your funds or even take some of it through government decreed bail-ins,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSo how exactly would you even be able to get into a cloud savings-like system if your bank accounts are froze?\u201d Chester asked. \u201cYour wages.\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 7, "day": 7}

The partnership means that nearly half of Americans currently have access to this continuously expanding service.\nOverstock\u2019s newest fresh-food partner,\u00a0Front Door Farms, whose products are now offered through\u00a0Overstock\u2019s Farmers Market, delivers to the customer\u2019s door two or three days after harvest.\n\u201cWe chose Front Door Farms because it works with local farmers to harvest fruits and vegetables that are fresh and nutritious,\u201d said Overstock CEO Patrick M. Byrne. \u201cOur goal is to deliver fresh produce the way farmers grow it, as opposed to the food-like substances delivered through this nation\u2019s agribusiness supply chains. Products sold in Overstock\u2019s Farmers Market are designed to inspire creativity, fun and imagination in kitchens using the best ingredients.\u201d\nThat\u2019s very good news for those consumers who prefer to bypass traditional mass-distribution channels and buy directly from food producers for a healthier and greener life. It\u2019s also very good news for bitcoin users, because Overstock is the largest online retailer to accept bitcoin payments for all the products offered via its web store.\nThose who are paid in bitcoin and wish to pay in bitcoin for most of the goods and services that they need \u2013 a small but fast-growing population \u2013 will find Overstock\u2019s new initiative appealing. Buying food in bitcoin is also a useful strategy to escape the growing surveillance of bank transfers to and from bitcoin exchanges and \u201cbitcoin banks,\u201d which could become a bottleneck in the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nIf banks start rejecting transfers from Circle or Coinbase, consumers will have more options to use their bitcoin directly, without having to go through the banks.\nIn other Overstock news, the company wants to extend its promotion of fresh and clean ways to Wall Street.\n\u201cWe have started building things that replace what Wall Street does,\u201d\u00a0said Byrne to TheStreet, referring to\u00a0the announcement\u00a0in June of the first crypto-securities to be offered on the blockchain. \u201cIt does them far cheaper, and with far more transparency, and without any of the opportunity for rigging.\u201d\nByrne stated that he is interested in \u201ccleaning up\u201d Wall Street.\nOverstock\u2019s platform, known as\u00a0t0.com, can augment other trading exchanges and power financial transactions. Overstock\u00a0filed a registration\u00a0with the Securities and Exchange Commission seeking permission to issue public crypto-stock, andpurchased a stake\u00a0in stock brokerage firm Pro Securities, whose technology will power the crypto-stock exchange. Byrne said to expect further announcements about the platform this summer, and that it presents an \u201cextraordinary opportunity\u201d for Overstock because it has the potential to be disruptive.\nIn fact, the crypto-stock exchange could sidestep traditional stock exchanges such as NYSE and NASDAQ and issue corporate stock directly over the Internet.\nThese two stories seem only related by their origin, but there is a common thread. In both cases, Overstock wants to move beyond legacy systems with too many intermediaries, wasteful inefficiencies and potential for fraud, toward a streamlined, cheaper and more sustainable way of life.", "year": 2015, "month": 7, "day": 15}

Co-Founder of DNotes, Alan Yong Shares His Vision.", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/grexit-digital-currency-long-term-solution-co-founder-dnotes-alan-yong-shares-vision-1436319566/", "birthday": "Jul 7, 2015  9:39 PM EST", "date": "2015-07-08 02:39:00", "content": "Bitcoin Press Release:\u00a0With Greece\u2019s Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras suggesting the Greek government could issue their own digital currency \u2013 is this a viable solution? Alan Yong of\u00a0DNotes\u00a0explores how an established, ethical digital currency may be the most sustainable long term solution for Greece, and why digital currency enables anyone to access their money whenever they need it.\n\n\u201cThis is a very sad and tragic situation. The rich may end up losing a vacation home in a foreign country but many of the less fortunate are at risk of losing their entire life savings, while being too old to rebuild their nest egg. It is even more depressing when no viable political solutions exist to give Greece\u2019s citizens any hope of rebuilding their financial future\u201d \u2013 Alan Yong, tech Entrepreneur and Co-Founder of DNotes.\n\nGreece\u2019s difficulty to live within its fiscal means has resulted in tough austerity measures in exchange for bailout money from the European Central Bank, causing Greek citizens great hardship. According to the former senior executive of PIMCO, El Erian\n\n\u201cGreeks have seen their living standards cut, unemployment is running at 26 percent, youth unemployment is over 50 percent and they\u2019re about to face an even bigger depression.\u201d\n\nSmall business owners unable to pay suppliers risk losing their business. Importers dependent on letter of credit facilities face an immediate halt to trading. Just like its citizens, the Greek government must also pay its bills. Its inability to do so could mean the reintroduction of a much devalued currency like the drachma, and there has been talk of creating their own\u00a0digital currency.\nPrime Minister Alexis Tsipras has suggested that the Greek government could issue their own digital currency in the event that the EU does not agree to eased conditions for Greece\u2019s bailout repayments. Yong takes exception,\n\n\u201cWhat Greece needs, is to adopt a global digital currency that is built with trust and integrity for everybody worldwide, so that anyone may participate regardless of financial or economic standing. If Greece chooses to return to a national currency like the drachma, or government backed digital currency, it is unlikely that currency would have much value outside of Greece. Greek citizens will fear that the new currency will be worth much less than their current euro deposits, and this will be counter-productive to preventing further bank runs. I believe that a digital currency that has its value set globally is the solution; a currency that remains stable regardless of local political turmoil.DNotes is that currency.\u201d\n\nThe observed capital controls placed on Greeks by their government have raised serious questions about fiat money: if you are unable to withdraw your bank deposits from a bank, then is it really your money? This lost confidence in fiat currency is not unique to any particular nation. It is a global problem from governments printing more currency to cover their fiscal deficits, which devalues the money supply, taking value from citizens\u2019 savings. This is compounded by the fact that fiat currency is created as debt whenever new loans are created by banks. Banks are only required to keep small fraction (2-3%) of their existing loan liabilities as \u2018fractional reserves\u2019. Fiat money is merely an \u2018I owe you\u2019 \u2013 fiat money is debt. Its value is negative. In the case of digital currency, the amount of new currency introduced to the system is fixed, and no external player, institution or organization has control over or may change this. Digital currency is created as proof of work done in a cryptographic process called mining, a process that verifies who owns each and every digital token. Digital currency is not created as debt like fiat is.\nIn a recent interview on Cointelegraph by Raunaq Vaisoha,\u00a0DNotes Will Be Known as the Currency with a Purpose, Yong explained his passion to build a global digital currency. In this case, he envisions every Greek citizen being their own bank by taking advantage of digital currencies like DNotes to prevent another situation where people are unable to access their life savings. By making Greece the most regulatory friendly nation and the first to adopt global digital currency, Greece could be positioned to reap the immense benefits of Blockchain technologies and become the envy of other nations. It will be the catalyst of job creation and a huge draw for foreign investment. This will be a much better solution than any conceivable political solutions.\nYong concluded that:\n\n\u201cGreek citizens would have near zero transaction costs with instant transfers to anyone, anywhere in the world, while enjoying the benefits from financial integration with creditors worldwide, and not just banks in Greece. This technology would encourage trade, create jobs for Greece\u2019s unemployed, and lessen the impact of the Greek government\u2019s poor political and financial decisions. Greece\u2019s fortunes could better be reversed by treating its economy as a struggling large business that requires technological and efficiency changes and outside investment. DNotes is more than a global digital currency. It has created its own ecosystem by using highly scalable building blocks that can be deployed and ramped up quickly anywhere worldwide.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe live in a hyperconnected world rampant with digital revolutions, including digital currency. The DNotes community is at their best when challenged to passionately examine large social economic global problems. We are committed to positive and immediate response when there is local support with the right partnership.\u201d\n\nGreek media are invited to contact DNotes\u2019 local representative Ellie (Eleftheria) atellieyan2@gmail.com\nInquiries can also be made to Alan Yong, DNotes co-founder atContact@DNotescoin.com\nAbout Alan Yong:\nDNotes Co-Founder Alan Yong is a well-regarded visionary since the early days of personal computers.

While the network has been working to decrease this backlog \u2014 transactions are down to 31,000 at time of this article\u2019s writing \u2014 the type of transactions that are being sent suggest this is a continuation of a stress test that has been put on the system.\nThere have been numerous transactions hitting the network with tiny transaction values, such as 0.0001 bitcoin being sent repeatedly. While not every transaction has been this exact size, there have been numerous others sent every second, reaching hundreds of transactions per second at the peak.\nFurther, the physical sizes of these transactions are significantly greater than other ones with far more value. Due to the 1 megabyte cap on block size, the mining network has found it difficult to process all these small transactions.\nIn the past several weeks, similar stress tests have been run to inform the debate about whether to increase the total size of a block. Many argue that increasing it past 1 megabyte would be disastrous to the system. However, Gavin Andresen has argued for increasing it to 20 megabytes so that more total transactions could fit within one block, thus preventing scenarios and delays like are currently being seen.\nThe current proposed solution by some miners has been to raise it to 8 megabytes. Others have suggested the implementation of the Bitcoin Lightning Network, which is in development to implement hashed time-lock contracts between people.\nUpdate on 7/8/2015 at 10AM EST:\u00a0Despite early attempts to decrease the number of backlogged transactions, TradeBlock revealed today that there are currently over 81,000 unconfirmed transactions, due to the continued spam transactions being transferred.

Malmo\u2019s central thesis is that Bitcoin uses way too much electricity.\nThe essay opens with a future scenario that, in view of the\u00a0crisis in Greece, is beginning to appear more plausible \u2013 in 2018, Greece is long out of the Eurozone and economic malaise is spreading to neighboring countries.\u00a0\u00a0Panicked Europeans sell their euro for bitcoin, which is becoming a stable and respectable currency, causing even more user adoption and recognition by governments.\nAccording to Malmo this scenario, which sounds like heaven to faithful Bitcoin enthusiasts, is more like hell \u2013 a burning hell of bitcoin mining circuitry and electricity costs spiraling out of control.\nMalmo mentions\u00a0huge mining operations in China\u00a0with a catastrophic environmental impact, and notes that the total power consumption of the Bitcoin network is estimated by computer cooling firm Allied Control at\u00a0250 megawatts to 500 megawatts.\n\u201cThat\u2019s around enough zap to power 173,000 average American households\u2019 daily electricity usage,\u201d says Malmo. \u201cWith about 110,000 transactions per day, that works out to 1.57 households daily usage of electricity per bitcoin transaction.\u201d\nHis conclusion: \u201cYes, every time you buy something in bitcoin, you could be using as much electricity as 1.57 American families do in a day.\u201d\nAs climate change becomes a more pressing concern for humanity every day, this huge level of energy use is difficult to justify for a currency wanting to improve on the current arrangement.\n\u201cIt appears there are significant challenges to ensuring that Bitcoin\u2019s growth minimizes environmental impacts,\u201d noted Jeremy McDaniels, a financial system sustainability expert with the United Nations Environment Program. \u201cEnergy footprints could be an issue if major scale-up is achieved.\u201d\nThat\u2019s is already a lot for passionate Bitcoin evangelists to swallow, but Malmo makes things even worse when he unfavorably compares Bitcoin to the Visa network \u2013 of all things \u2013 in terms of energy consumption:\n\u201cThat makes Bitcoin about 5,033 times more energy intensive, per transaction, than Visa.\u201d\nThat caused the anger of many readers, who promptly pointed out that the analysis doesn\u2019t take into account the overall energy footprint of traditional payment, banking and financial service providers. Some accuse the author of just having his facts wrong.\nMalmo\u2019s analysis seems, indeed, a bit forced and overstated. However, dismissing it without consideration would be a disservice to Bitcoin, because everything needs constructive criticism to move beyond current flaws. Bitcoin is \u2013 though perhaps not to the extent denounced by Malmo \u2013 less energy efficient than it could and should be.\nMalmo notes that developers might be able to reduce Bitcoin\u2019s energy footprint by moving ahead with the controversial proposed increase of the block size to\u00a020 megabytes, or\u00a08 megabytes.\nAnother option to reduce Bitcoin\u2019s energy footprint would be implementing energy-efficient\u00a0Sidechains, separate from the main Bitcoin blockchain but interoperable with it by means of two-way pegs, or\u00a0Lightning Networks, where related transactions can take place instantly on \u201cmicropayment channels\u201d off-chain, and only the final settlement is processed by the blockchain.

Many users chose to sell litecoin and buy bitcoin, which is also one of the sources where bitcoin purchasing power comes from.\u201d\nGiven this week\u2019s turmoil in the stock market in China, it would be tempting to assume that the current increase in bitcoin price and trading volume on Chinese exchanges is a direct result of this alone.\nChinese exchanges confirm that bitcoin trading volume is growing\nJack Liu, Head of International at OKCoin told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cAs the largest exchange in China, we\u2019ve seen a near 50% increase in volume in the past month.\u201d\nAll three exchanges said the stock market closure had little to do with the increase in volume as this trend started three weeks to a month ago.\nGreg Wolfson, Director of Business Development for BTCChina, told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a sustained increase in trading volume over the last three weeks, roughly coinciding with the Greek referendum. In part, this is driven by speculators and investors seeking safe haven, because global macro events are an important force in the market right now\u2026\n\u201cIn fact, there is no monetary crisis in China. There is a sharp correction in the stock market, but bitcoin did not play any role in that. The current value of all the bitcoins in circulation globally is insignificant compared to the capitalization of Chinese stock markets. The correction in the stock markets is perceived as resulting from excessive margin lending and the entry of many novice investors. It\u2019s a classic stock market bubble. There is no perception that bitcoin played any role and no evidence to support that.\u201d\nHuobi CEO Li put the current situation in perspective saying it still doesn\u2019t compare with the bitcoin price spike of late 2013 and early 2014.\n\u201cThe price of bitcoin has experienced a rise to some extent. And the exchange volume has also become more active. But this cannot be recognized as significant increases or changes. The volume of bitcoin users has increased about twice than in period of downturn, however there\u2019s still a gap if we compare it to the peak time at the end of 2013 and the beginning of 2014.\u201d\nThere is some speculation that the upcoming \u201chalving\u201d of litecoin, due in late August, may be driving sales to some extent but not enough to explain the sudden increases in the last week.\nWith continuing uncertainty in Greece, anxiety over the\u00a0recent spam attack on bitcoin, and an unfolding litecoin ponzi scheme, the price of bitcoin may be at the center of an almost \u201cperfect storm\u201d.\n\u00a0\nPhoto\u00a0GoShow\u00a0/ CC BY-SA 3.0\u00a0", "year": 2015, "month": 7, "day": 12}

Lee Gibson-Grant, founder of U.K.-based digital currency consultancy\u00a0Coinstructors, recently met with the Mayor of\u00a0Agistri, an island in Saronic Gulf with a population of around a thousand people. The Mayor has agreed to start testing blockchain technology solutions in the island.\nThe single ATM on Agistri ran out money last week.\nThe project is related to the\u00a0Drachmae\u00a0project covered by\u00a0Bitcon Magazine\u00a0in May. Proposed by CNBC contributor Brian Kelly, the author of \u201cThe Bitcoin Big Bang: How Alternative Currencies Are About to Change the World,\u201d Drachmae is intended as a quick and simple bitcoin-like solution for Greece\u2019s troubled economy.\nKelly provides more detail in a\u00a0CNBC\u00a0post titled \u201cGreek island agrees to test digital currency.\u201d He is persuaded that the technology behind bitcoin can be used to create a store of value that is independent of the traditional banking system.\n\u201cThe digital currency I created last year,\u00a0Nautiluscoin, was designed to tackle this specific task,\u201d says Kelly.\u201c We can now offer Greece a digital currency that is backed by gold and is integrated into a mobile-banking platform.\nThe Mayor of Agistri has agreed to allow the island to be a pilot program for a new monetary ecosystem, which will use Nautiluscoin. Over the coming weeks, the infrastructure for this project will be rolled out and the citizens of Agistri will receive Nautiluscoin to begin transacting.\nNautiluscoin will be backed by gold, which, according to Kelly, is still the most trusted independent form of money. Coinstructors, a partner in the project, developed\u00a0drachmae.money\u00a0and\u00a0Dracmae Connect\u00a0to create a transaction system. The system will charge a fee for each Nautiluscoin transaction, and the fees will be used to purchase gold for a \u201cNautiluscoin Stability Fund.\u201d\nThat may sound a bit circular and chaotic, but probably the project developers haven\u2019t had the time to fully detail the mechanism of the proposed monetary system. At the time of writing, the\u00a0drachmae.money\u00a0website still has a \u201cLorem ipsum\u2026\u201d placeholder for yet-to-be-written text.\n\u201cUsing gold to back Nautiluscoin should give both tourists and merchants assurance that a digital currency is more than just lines of computer code,\u201d says Kelly. \u201cA digital currency like Nautiluscoin can be quickly deployed to kick-start the tourism industry. We have already begun to implement this plan and estimate that it will take 60 to 90 days to fully execute.\u201d\nLocal businesses can create a loyalty program via Drachmae Connect, which enables tourists to book hotels and other services at a discount. While Agistri is a test case, the initiative could be applied throughout Greece, and Gibson-Grant is persuaded that a parallel digital currency would be an ideal solution for the nation. \u201cA digital currency over the blockchain would be ideal right now for Greece and tourists,\u201d he said.\nKelly notes that the project is inspired by the highly successful\u00a0WIR Bank\u00a0that manages and issues the private currency WIR franc in Switzerland. The WIR Bank was established by two Swiss businessmen in 1934 in response to a failing economy and currency shortages.", "year": 2015, "month": 7, "day": 9}

Enigma is a Bitcoin blockchain-based encryption system that enables untrusted and anonymous computers to share sensitive information with a third party without putting the data at risk of hacking attacks and breaches.\nThe system will be able to prevent shared information from being surveilled by government entities or law enforcement, as it can only be decrypted by the holder of the decryption keys.\n\u201cYou can see it as a black box,\u201d explained Guy Zyskind, one of the developers of Enigma and an MIT Media Lab graduate researcher. \u201cYou send whatever data you want, and it runs in the black box and only returns the result. The actual data is never revealed, neither to the outside nor to the computers running the computations inside.\u201d\nIn a way, Enigma\u2019s techniques and properties resemble a few features of Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized network infrastructure. Enigma encrypts data by disassociating it into several components, and by randomly segregating it to hundreds of computers in the Enigma network, also known as nodes. Then, each node runs calculations on its assigned block of data, until a user merges the results to decrypt a block.\nThe mathematical algorithms are designed by the developers of Enigma, and the nodes execute calculations only on the blocks of data that it is assigned to.\nThe ownership of data, or chunks of information, is then stored as metadata in the Bitcoin blockchain, which prevents the ledger of ownership from being forged or altered.\n\u201cI can take my age, this one piece of data, and split it into pieces, and give it to 10 people,\u201d says Zyskind. \u201cIf you ask each one of those persons, they have only a random chunk. Only by combining enough of those pieces can they decrypt the original data.\u201d\nWhat Enigma\u2019s Encryption System Can Bring\nIf Enigma\u2019s encryption system works out flawlessly like the developers promise, it would create a whole different ecosystem where private databases can be hosted without threats from third-party entities, such as governments or law enforcement trying to surveil the information.\nWhile cloud databases and platforms such as Dropbox and even Facebook areobligated\u00a0or often forced to pass on sensitive data at governments\u2019 will, the same cannot be done for Enigma\u2019s cloud services, because the data simply cannot be revealed without the decryption keys which only its owners hold and control.\nEnigma would also allow users to safely share all kinds of information with companies without any risks of releasing sensitive data. \u201cNo one wants to give their data to some company when you don\u2019t know what they\u2018ll do with it,\u201d explained Oz Nathan, Enigma\u2019s co-creator. \u201cBut if you have guaranteed privacy, data analysis can be a lot more powerful.

The new bailout for Greece would involve both \u201cserious reforms\u201d and \u201cfinancial support,\u201d said Donald Tusk, president of the European Council.\nLast week Greek voters issued a surprisingly loud and clear statement of support to Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, and defiance to European authorities and the International Monetary Fund. In the referendum celebrated on July 5, the Greeks\u00a0said no\u00a0to the bailout deal proposed by the country\u2019s creditors.\nThe agreement on the new bailout deal is tough on Greece, but better than alternatives that have been discussed in the frantic negotiations of last week. It appears that Grexit \u2013 the forced exit of Greece from the Eurozone and perhaps from the European Union itself \u2013 has been avoided for now.\nThe question remains whether the current agreement and the detailed bailout plan that is expected to be unveiled in the next hours or days are solid enough to provide a stable and sustainable solution to the Greek crisis. The situation in Greece remains very difficult \u2013 so difficult, in fact, that the possibility of a\u00a0parallel currency\u00a0for Greece, either issued by the government or spontaneously established by the citizens themselves, remains plausible.\nWriting at\u00a0The Wall Street Journal, Christopher Mims\u00a0notes\u00a0that \u2013 although bitcoin is evolving much more quickly than some observers realize \u2013 the digital currency as it is cannot help the Greeks of today. But it could be of great help to the Greeks of tomorrow, or the citizens of other countries that fall into serious financial troubles.\nMims notes that Greek companies are already starting to do what is often done in times of currency crisis, paying suppliers and employees in IOUs, or scrip \u2013 an example of\u00a0local currencies\u00a0that can be spent a particular area in addition to a national currency, with or without the backing of the government and the status of legal tender. Other types of local currencies are\u00a0Local Exchange Trade Systems, or LETS. The local currency WIR franc, established in the 1930 by Swiss\u00a0WIR Bank\u00a0in response to a failing economy and currency shortages, has been proposed as a conceptual model for a blockchain-based parallel currency, which will be introduced in\u00a0a pilot project\u00a0for a Greek island.\nMichael Casey, the co-author of\u00a0The Age Of Cryptocurrency, a former Wall Street Journal reporter who is now a\u00a0senior adviser\u00a0to the\u00a0MIT Digital Currency Initiative, told Mims that the blockchain technology could be used to issue scrip. One possibility is using \u201csidechains\u201d separate from the main Bitcoin blockchain, but interoperable with it by means of two-way pegs.\nUsing sidechains, Greece could create a \u201ccollateralized currency\u201d backed by state-owned assets. Cryptocoins representing a fraction of all the country\u2019s islands, ports and factories would hold their value as long as people believe the underlying assets do. Another possibility would be to use divisible cryptocoins to implement a flexible, scalable local barter system based on fractional ownership of goods and assets.\n\u201cIf you have infinitely divisible claims on an asset, then you could trade a third of a horse for a trip to Acapulco,\u201d said Casey.", "year": 2015, "month": 7, "day": 13}

At that time, the Copay team announced that they will be taking community feedback to improve upon the platform. This week, the team launched Copay 1.1.0, with new features including custom transaction fee settings, wallet fund sweeping and fund transfer between wallets.\nFirst, the new fee customization feature enables users to customize the fees of transactions sent from wallets in the app. This way, users have more control over transaction confirmation speeds, as miners will prefer to have transactions with higher miner fees confirmed first to store it in a block. The current options are: Economy (10 bits per Kb), Normal (50 bits per Kb), Priority (100 bits per Kb), and Emergency (500 bits per Kb).\nAnother feature which gives more control to users is the new spending proposal deletion rules that makes it easier for shared wallets to unlock funds. Previously, the creators of unused proposals could erase only if no other copayers rejected it. Now,\n\nAny copayer can delete a pending spending proposal if the proposal was created more than 24 hours prior.\nIn the first 24 hours, the creator of the spending proposal can delete the proposal as long as it has no other signatures from other copayers (though it may have rejections).\n\nVersion 1.1.1 of the Copay wallet adds some additional bug fixes and the ability to export your transaction history as a .csv file from the desktop Copay app. This feature is especially important for users that require the ability to calculate the tax on any transactions made using the wallet.\nFurthermore, with additional features like fund transfer between wallets and wallet fund sweeping, Copay makes it much simpler and faster for users to send transactions to another wallet.", "year": 2015, "month": 7, "day": 13}

Speaking to\u00a0The New Statesman, Varoufakis\u00a0expressed his disappointment\u00a0with \u201cthe complete lack of any democratic scruples, on behalf of the supposed defenders of Europe\u2019s democracy.\u201d (Read the\u00a0full transcript\u00a0of Varoufakis interview.)\nOf course, Varoufakis is referring to the EU leaders. In the interview, he gives a long account of the months of negotiations since he became Greece\u2019s finance minister and internal disagreements in the Greek government. He also speaks up in very blunt terms, saying the Eurogroup is \u201ccompletely and utterly\u201d controlled by Germany, Greece was \u201cset up,\u201d and last week\u2019s referendum was wasted.\n\u201c[By] the time the liquidity almost ran out completely, and we were in default, or quasi-default, to the IMF, they introduced their proposals, which were absolutely impossible \u2026 totally non-viable and toxic,\u201d said Varoufakis. \u201cSo they delayed and then came up with the kind of proposal you present to another side when you don\u2019t want an agreement.\u201d\nVaroufakis, who\u00a0accused Athens\u2019 creditors of \u201cterrorism\u201d\u00a0the day before the referendum, is especially critical of the\u00a0Eurogroup, an informal body where the ministers of the Eurozone discuss matters relating to their shared responsibilities on the euro.\nThe Eurogroup is, in Varoufakis\u2019 words, \u201ca non-existent group that has the greatest power to determine the lives of Europeans. It\u2019s not answerable to anyone, given it doesn\u2019t exist in law; no minutes are kept; and it\u2019s confidential. So no citizen ever knows what is said within. \u2026 These are decisions of almost life and death, and no member has to answer to anybody.\u201d\nVaroufakis added that the Eurogroup is totally controlled by the finance minister of Germany.\nThe terms of the agreement that will, for the time being, keep Greece in the Eurozone aren\u2019t significantly better than the proposals rejected by the Greek citizens on July 5. The referendum could then be seen as a farce staged to appease the citizens, which is likely to cause Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras considerable opposition at home, from politicians \u2013 even within his own party Syriza \u2013 and citizens angered at his capitulation to humiliating terms. The opposition could be strong enough to precipitate new elections.\nThe New Statesman\u00a0article notes that the Eurozone can dictate terms to Greece because it is persuaded that its banks are now protected if Greek banks default, and, therefore, are no longer afraid of a Grexit. But that ignores another aspect of the crisis, more difficult to quantify: If the citizens in Greece and other countries become convinced that the EU is their enemy, they will vote en-masse for anti-EU parties, including parties of very questionable reputation, which would have catastrophic consequence for the Union. This scenario doesn\u2019t even need a formal Grexit to materialize.\nVaroufakis said that he never believed Greece should go straight to a new currency. Rather, his plan was that, in case of unsuccessful negotiations, Greece should issue its own Euro-denominated IOUs as a parallel currency-like means of exchange for the citizens.\nThat could still happen unofficially, by initiative of Greek banks, businesses or grassroots groups, which could\u00a0establish a parallel economy\u00a0with scrip or Local Exchange Trade Systems (LETS) based on bitcoin, with or without the backing of the government and the status of legal tender.", "year": 2015, "month": 7, "day": 14}

Since the majority of the population has no access to bank accounts or credit cards, Bitso aims to provide the nation with a cheaper yet robust mobile payment platform by connecting its bitcoin exchange with Transfer.\nTransfer is a lightweight banking initiative developed by the Mexican government as a collaboration with Mexican banks and corporations including Banamex, Inbursa, Telcel and Oxxo.\nSimilar to M-Pesa, the popular mobile payment service launched by Vodafone in Kenya, the joint project of Transfer and Bitso allows users to send pesos using bitcoin to more than 100 million cell phones in Mexico.\nThe receivers can withdraw cash at Banamex or Inbursa ATMs, creating a nationwide network of bitcoin withdrawal locations, thus increasing national bitcoin adoption.\n\u201cWhether you are talking about new payments services that help facilitate faster and cheaper money transfers across the world\u2019s most active remittance corridor, or mobile money and microfinance opportunities for Mexico\u2019s underbanked consumers, bitcoin and blockchain technology is poised to transform financial services in Mexico and all of Latin America,\u201d said Silbert.\u00a0\u201cBitso is well-positioned to emerge as the region\u2019s leader in bitcoin exchange and payments, and we are thrilled to partner with them to help build a big, important company in this emerging industry.\u201d\nBitso to Emerge as Leading Mexican Bitcoin Exchange\nLaunched in April 2014, Bitso is one of the most prominent bitcoin exchanges in Mexico, with top-tier security standards and strong focus on regulatory compliance. To compete against Mexico\u2019s leading exchanges like Volabit and meXBT, Bitso recently acquired Unisend Mexico, a bitcoin exchange which operates in both Argentina and Mexico.\n\u201cThrough Bitso, we have enabled an efficient and low-cost backbone for cross-border transactions,\u201d explained Bitso founder and CEO Pablo Gonzalez. \u201cWe believe this will be a powerful rail to streamline international B2B payments, and remittances to the millions of unbanked and underbanked Mexican citizens.\u201d\nFounder talks Bitcoin Adoption in Mexico\n\u201cThe most exciting aspect we are seeing firsthand is all the cross-border payment applications that are just beginning to happen: remittances, B2B payments, etc. Mexico is a hotbed for global payments,\" Gonzalez told Bitcoin Magazine. The US-Mexico corridor is the largest in the world with $24 billion USD-a-year flow.\u00a0\nInternational trade and commerce is even larger. $360 billion USD a year, and it is bi-directonal ($761 billion total.) Several partners, including traditional remittance companies, bitcoin remittance startups and cross-border payment businesses, have been running tests and pilot programs for the past few months.\nGonzalez said that Bitcoin adoption has been growing steadily month-on-month in Mexico, as more businesses have begun to accept bitcoin payments.\n\u201cWe talk to the regulators on a regular basis,\" he said. \"It is positive overall. They are very excited about the potential ... However, they feel it is premature to regulate,\" he said, a view similar \"to some of the conclusions taken by the Canadian Senate recently.\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 29}

Along with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, California Gov. Jerry Brown, San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee and other dignitaries, a cohort of 70 digital leaders were invited to celebrate the historic event. Included among the 70 was BitGive Foundation founder Connie Gallippi and Alyse Killeen of March Capital, both representing the Bitcoin industry.\u201cIt was a true honor and pleasure to be invited to join the United Nations 70th Anniversary Celebration and luncheon for the Top 70 Bay Area Tech Leaders,\u201d Gallippi said. \u201cAttending this event and representing Bitcoin\u2019s philanthropic foundation was truly an inspiring and educational experience.\u201dAfter the formal public ceremony at City Hall, which included speeches and the presentation of the Key to the City of San Francisco to the U.N. secretary-general, there was a luncheon followed by a group discussion among the digital leaders.\"Our #UN70 Digital Leader peers generally came from two camps: 1) sophisticated technology innovators and investors, and 2) social impact entrepreneurs and funders,\u201d said Killeen. \u201cWhat was most exciting was the overlap that existed between these groups. The technologists were highly socially aware, and the social impact leaders were technically savvy. Bitcoin and blockchain further connects the two camps, and, as a result, was a popular topic of discussion.\"Killeen also noted that there was a good deal of diversity among the members. The list of leaders in the consortium included men and women from around the world.\u201cI met so many top-notch entrepreneurs and tech leaders with a common passion for making a positive social impact,\" Gallippi added. \"Everyone was very positive and open-minded, and many were curious and inspired by the possibilities for Bitcoin to help drive change on important issues.\u201dTo everyone\u2019s surprise, the secretary-general introduced a special guest at the leaders\u2019 luncheon: Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai. She had asked particularly for the opportunity to speak with the digital leadership group.\u201cMeeting Malala was the highlight of the event for me,\u201d said Gallippi. \u201cShe is such an amazing inspiration.\u201dShe added that Malala spoke \u201coff the cuff\u201d about the potential impact of technology on empowering girls and women in the developing world, but that tech companies must be sensitive to the needs of the people they are trying to reach. The existing infrastructure also needs to be taken into consideration and adequate support must be offered.Other highlights of the conference included the introduction of The Global Goals initiative which will roll out in September.This ambitious collection of 17 goals, developed by U.N. representatives from all over the world, include ending extreme poverty, fighting inequalities and tackling climate change.\u201cIt was quite exciting to see the perfect alignment of these Global Goals with the mission of the BitGive Foundation,\u201d said Gallippi. \u201cI look forward to leveraging bitcoin, blockchain technology, and the Bitcoin industry to help reach these universal goals for a better world for all!\u201d\u00a0Killeen echoed Gallippi\u2019s enthusiasm after the event: \u201cI'm excited to take the next steps to work with other U.N. Digital Leaders on blockchain-based project ideas born at SF City Hall on the U.N.'s 70th birthday!\u201dThe BitGive Foundation, the first U.S.-registered Bitcoin charity, is currently soliciting donations for its 2nd Anniversary online auction to be held next week. Thus far, the Foundation has collected items and services from individuals and companies alike, including autographed books from Zapchain and Purse, jewelry from Overstock, and getaways from Gem COO Ken Miller and Airbitz CEO Paul Puey, among others. All funds raised through the auction will support the foundation\u2019s work to support various philanthropic efforts on behalf of the Bitcoin community.Both Gallippi and Killeen will be presenting at the upcoming Inside Bitcoins conference in Chicago on July 10-11th, where the conference will also be hosting a fundraising campaign for BitGive.For more information about the BitGive Foundation and its charitable mandate, visit www.BitGiveFoundation.org.\u00a0Photos courtesy of Connie Gallippi.", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 30}

Since the data and copyright cannot be changed once it is registered on the blockchain, artists will be able to defend their works without the need to spend money on the traditional process of hiring lawyers to create legal documents.\nWhile traditional forms of copyrights and patents are difficult to track and usually take days or even weeks to sell or transfer, Ascribe allows its users to sell their ownership securely and cost-free through the bitcoin blockchain.\nSince the platform allows users to embed images and texts on the blockchain, artists also may register copyrights for physical art such as sculpture, by simply uploading images of the work with follow-up descriptions.\nCopyrights to the artworks registered on Ascribe will be available to public like a torrent file, which can be downloaded and used freely. However, the distributor or the user in this case, will always have full authority over the artwork, and will always possess the power to deny or grant access to their works.\nAccording to the company, more than 600 artists have already signed up for access, and over 2,600 works of art have been registered. Several marketplaces and platforms are also using Ascribe\u2019s API to display the copyrights to the artwork.\nAscribe is currently in progress of designing a machine learning technology which will be able to search through the web to classify copied works without watermarks.\nEncrypting Unique Data on the Blockchain\nAscribe is using the function of the Bitcoin blockchain to encode additional information in transactions. On May 6, rock band 22HERTZ encrypted the copyrights to their album on the Bitcoin blockchain, using a function of the blockchain called OP_RETURN, which is a standardized function of the Bitcoin blockchain that allows data to be passed onto a transaction.\nIn this case, a user defined sequence of up to 40 bytes can be stored in the blockchain, which is enough to store encrypted texts of links to images, songs and long texts.\nWhile storing information and data on the blockchain has been criticized as being inefficient, the transparency of the blockchain makes it extremely easy for artists to track their copyrights and ownerships to their works instantly.\u00a0Image via Ascribe", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 27}

The decision comes at the end of a weekend that brought Greece closer to \u201cGrexit\u201d \u2013 the potential exit from the Eurozone and perhaps the European Union (EU) itself \u2013 and confronted Europe with a serious crisis.\nThe banks in Greece and the Athene Stock Exchange will remain closed until at least July 6, the day after the referendum on the austerity measures demanded by the country\u2019s creditors. In the meantime, cash withdrawals at ATMs will be limited to 60 euros ($66) and transfers abroad will be forbidden. Greece is the second Eurozone country, after Cyprus in 2013, to impose capital controls.\nThe move is evidently aimed at preventing panicked Greek investors and savers from taking their money out of the nation\u2019s banks and moving it elsewhere. In the days before the predictable stall of the negotiations with Europe, many Greeks rushed to withdraw their money. The Financial Times reports that many more Greeks are trying to withdraw their money now, but they are turned away by security guards.\n\u201cIn the coming days, what\u2019s needed is patience and composure,\u201d Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said on television. \u201cThe bank deposits of the Greek people are fully secure. The same applies to the payment of wages and pensions \u2013 they are also guaranteed.\u201d He added that the European authorities, seeking to stifle the will of the Greek people, are to be blamed. \u201cThey will not succeed,\u201d he said.\nWilliam Dudley, the president of the Reserve Bank of New York, said that Grexit risk was a \u201chuge wild card.\u201d He warned in an interview with the Financial Times that the financial market implications of a Greek exit from the euro could be graver than many investors seemed to believe, because it would set a \u201chuge precedent\u201d indicating that euro membership was reversible. \u201cMy personal view is if this goes badly the market reaction may be bigger than what we realize,\u201d he said.\nEven if Greece and the EU find a way to avoid Grexit, it seems likely that the introduction of capital controls will push people, not only wealthy investors but also ordinary people, to the conclusion that governments and banks couldn\u2019t be trusted with their hard-earned savings. They may then start looking for alternative ways to store value, out of reach of predatory central banks.\nWhen capital controls were introduced in Cyprus, Bitcoin came to the rescue, and many people took money out of their saving accounts at the first opportunity, and bought bitcoin instead. The recent rise in the exchange rate of bitcoin seems to indicate that the same is happening now as a consequence of the Greek crisis. Actually, there are indications that pessimist \u2013 or savvy \u2013 Greeks have been buying bitcoin for some time now.\nOne thing is certain \u2013 when people start to lose confidence in the ability of their government and central bank to ensure a healthy economy and a stable currency, they start looking for alternative ways to store value. Today, crypto-currencies are replacing gold and other traditional alternatives.\nAnother possibility, which would have been dismissed as science-fiction only one year ago but is beginning to appear more and more plausible, is that governments could tolerate \u2013 or even adopt \u2013 parallel currencies including crypto-currencies.\nGerman Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said that Greece may need a parallel currency if talks with creditors fail, according to sources familiar with Schaeuble\u2019s views. And Greece\u2019s Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis wrote a blog post in February proposing a similar IOU-based currency, which he dubbed Future Tax Coin (FT-Coin). Varoufakis is not impressed by bitcoin as a currency, but he is persuaded that its underlying technology could be put to effective use in troubled economies.", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 29}

They can see the threat from blockchain fintech, and are considering ways to integrate selected aspects into their own operations.\n\"We are not currently working actively on any bitcoin-based solutions, but we watch the cryptocurrency market closely,\u201d said Andrew Buckley, head of MasterCard products for Europe. \"We find them interesting from a technology perspective, but currently don't see them as a viable solution for mainstream commerce.\u201d\n\u201cOur focus is on these hundreds of millions of people with a bit of plastic in their wallets,\u201d he added. \u201cHow do we get them into this new digital world? Once we have sorted that out, and the two billion people that haven't got a card, then we may start worrying about other things.\"\nRecently, MasterCard replied to the U.K. government call for information with a put-down of bitcoin and other digital currencies. MasterCard claimed that digital currency transaction costs are lower than credit cards only because providers of digital currency services do not bear any compliance costs, and that, while digital currency payments are not faster than the MasterCard network, credit card transactions are intrinsically more secure.\nThat should be interpreted in view of the recent announcement of MasterCard Send, a personal payments service that enables funds to be sent quickly and securely to consumers domestically and internationally. Barb King, a group head in the MasterCard Payment Systems Integrity Group, described the service to PYMNTS as \u201ca breakthrough platform in the industry.\u201d\n\u201cThe distributed ledger is really useful for peer-to-peer transfers,\u201d said Neal Sample, president of Enterprise Growth at American Express. \"So the work that Amex does, while it could be supported by distributed ledger, goes far beyond peer-to-peer. It involves creating a set of guarantees and a set of services for both consumers and merchants that they wouldn't get if they were just trying to transact with one another.\u201d\nAccording to Sample, payment is just one of many stages in the commerce cycles, and companies such as American Express provide a complete infrastructure for consumer protection. While bitcoin transactions are intrinsically irreversible, with no consumer protection against fraud, American Express will actively help its customers.\n\"There are two elements here: the blockchain technology itself, which is very interesting for transactions, then there is bitcoin the currency,\u201d said Jonathan Vaux, executive director of innovation partnerships at Visa Europe. \"We are certainly looking at applications involving blockchain. What can you do with this? We know there's a peer-to-peer transaction network happening, but we don't see it scaling unless there is trust in the system. Certainly we are looking at it in a lab environment, and as quick way of routing it's exciting. We have a team in London looking at specific use cases.\u201d\nLike American Express and MasterCard, Visa is closely following other aspects of fintech innovation as well.\u00a0 \"Visa is facilitating Apple Pay with tokenization, but the card holders won't know about \u2013 I mean it makes them safer but they won't know about that, and as far as they are concerned it will operate like a contactless transaction,\" Vaux said.\n\nPhoto\u00a0PE-Commerce Visa (Test tamron 17-50 2.8)\u00a0/\u00a0Photopin", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 29}

Furthermore, with offices spread throughout California, Northern Ireland and Singapore, Bitnet will fund its merchants with any local currencies of their choice.\n\u201cWe recognize that the bitcoin ecosystem is growing throughout the world and are excited to be the first European PSP to partner with Bitnet to enable merchants to accept payments in bitcoin,\u201d said Ralf Gladis, CEO of Computop. \u201cThrough this partnership, retailers don\u2019t have to worry about the management of this evolving payment method.

The game features a transparent \u201cGameChain\u201d ledger and supports most popular digital currencies including Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Peercoin, NXT, Primecoin, LTC and more. It is fun, innovative and an excellent multi-functional hedging tool / trading platform.\nCrypto Collider presents a completely new way to increase and/or leverage Bitcoin\u2019s value without affecting its price. It is a game that provides trading utility while also being a fun and entertaining way to hedge, socialise and make profits. Collider has been featured in the official Adobe Flash Showcase.\nHow it Works\nCollider is a peer-to-peer game so fees are generated only as transfer fees when coins are passed between players as a result of game-play. Play occurs with a variety of high-quality industry leading cryptocurrencies which allows players to win, trade and hedge between their different coins as their strategies play out.\nThe game takes place in a virtual physics world where crypto coins take on a virtual physical presence as they enter the Collider Arena in the precise sequence, location, velocity, angle and spin created by the players using their mouse or touch-screen. Each \u201ccoin-throw\u201d has a different amount staked on it. The sum dollar value of that throw determines its in-game \u201cweight\u201d in both the physics calculation (ie. influence on the game objects) and percentage of winnings (when they win).\nThe end result is a first-of-its-kind Bitcoin skill based hedging game that is exciting and unpredictable while also fair and winnable with many second and third chances to profit.\nHow to Use as a Fun Hedging Tool\nUsers simply deposit some of the coin they would like to hedge OUT of and play with that coin in many little pieces, just not all at once, and keep playing as long as they can while playing only with that coin type. Once it\u2019s all gone, whatever they have won in that time in other coins, is effectively what they have hedged their original deposit into.\nThe game points they earn playing can also be converted into Collider Coin, a core product of the game that unlocks special features and strategic ability. Collider Coins can be played in-game for strategy but can never be lost and generate a percentage from every game fee for every holder.\nHow to Play For Profit\nCrypto Collider is easy to get started and difficult to master. Player\u2019s winning percentages tend to improve over time with practice and understanding. Ask questions and watch replays frame-by-frame from the beginning to really understand what each player has attempted and who was successful.\nCollider Coin\u2019s can be played but never lost, they are a specifically engineered game strategy tool with many unique and invaluable properties. Players can experiment with Collider Coin to find more ways to improve their rate of success. Learning Collider is similar to any skill based game based on the laws of physics and predicting opponents moves. It\u2019s a first-of-its-kind \u201cE-Money-Sport\u201d.\nCrypto Collider\u2019s \u201cGameChain\u201d \u2013 Innovation Under The Hood\nInspired by Bitcoin, Collider uses open source decentralised client-side physics code as a logarithm to create and confirm all results with complete transparency.

Further, it will be able to cryptographically display that it is in a solvent state.\nWhen dealing with brokerages and wallets, knowing that the provider is solvent can go a long way toward making a decision on using a service. This service will enable end users to analyze what the company's assets are and compare that to its liabilities, even drilling down to ensure that the user\u2019s own account is included in the total liabilities.\n\u201cWe're offering Verified by BitGo to selected partners as part of our unified\u00a0platform offerings. The first step needed is to use a BitGo wallet for\u00a0storing the business' bitcoin,\u201d Ben Davenport, CTO and co-founder of BitGo, said in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cIt is not yet available for general self-service signup, but we\u2019re interested in working with other Bitcoin businesses to help their security & transparency.\u201d\nChangeTip the First to Use\u00a0\nIn the announcement, it was revealed that ChangeTip was the first business that would be using the Verified by BitGo service.\n\"Building trust is critical to expanding our user base within the Bitcoin community and beyond, and using BitGo to demonstrate our Proof of Reserves goes a long way to achieving it,\" said ChangeTip CEO Nick Sullivan.\nAccording to an email exchange with Bitcoin Magazine, Sullivan believes that, \u201chaving the Verified by BitGo logo gives users an extra sense of security.\u201d\nHowever, BitGo is opening up its operation to anyone who uses the BitGo platform offerings. As Davenport said in a statement, \u201cToday we are launching our Verified by BitGo service, bringing the era of unverified funds to a close.\u201d\nIt Could Have Prevented MtGox\u00a0\nMtGox is the perfect example of a business that was operating in an insolvent state for a significant period of time. Users had no idea that the amount of bitcoin they believed existed on the exchange was far more than actually existed.\nThe team at BitGo believes that if Verified by BitGo had been around when MtGox was operating that its service would have been able to alert users far sooner to the problems at the exchange.\n\u201cYes, we believe it could have,\u201d Davenport said. \u201cBased on the information that\u2019s been made public, we believe MtGox was effectively operating in an insolvent state for a very long period. While a regular audit like this would not have eliminated the possibility of a business going insolvent, it should help detect it far sooner, dramatically reducing the magnitude of the ultimate losses.\u201d\nIn an internal crisis management document that was leaked, it was revealed that the company had lost 744,408 bitcoin in a theft that had taken place years earlier. Had a service like Verified by BitGo been around, it is feasible that many users would not have continued putting their bitcoin onto the exchange.\u201cWe are already working with several other companies interested in the\u00a0product, but don't have specific names to disclose yet,\u201d Davenport told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine.", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 30}

The decision came at the end of a weekend that brought Greece closer to \u201cGrexit\u201d \u2013 the potential exit from the Eurozone and perhaps the European Union (EU) itself \u2013 and confronted Europe with a serious crisis.\nToday, Jose Pagliery, the author of \u201cBitcoin - And the Future of Money,\u201d reports on CNN Money that Greeks are rushing to bitcoin. The article includes testimonials from top bitcoin exchanges such as bitcoin.de, Bitcurex, and China-based LakeBTC, stating that they are seeing a surge of business and inquiries from Greece.\nThis is, according to Pagliery, a pivotal moment.\u00a0\u201cBitcoin was created as an independent, computerized money in 2009 to provide a stark alternative to government-issued currency held at banks,\u201d he says. \u201cThis could be its moment to shine.\u201d\nThe introduction of capital controls is likely to push people, not only wealthy investors but also ordinary people, to the conclusion that governments and banks couldn\u2019t be trusted with their hard-earned savings. They may then start looking for alternative ways to store their savings, out of reach of predatory central banks, and choose bitcoin as the best alternative.\nWith limited access to their bank account and no legal way to transfer money abroad, the Greeks are likely to experience difficulties in buying bitcoin at the moment. But while it\u2019s late for the Greeks who waited until now to act, other less optimistic Greeks have been buying bitcoin for some time now.\u00a0In other countries, especially in neighboring European countries with troubled economies, it seems likely that people will begin to realize that the government can \u2013 and will \u2013 impose capital control and cut them from access to their savings if the economic situation worsens.\nBased on real-time reports collected by The Wall Street Journal, Zero Hedge notes that the contagious fear of capital controls may already be spreading from Greece to neighboring Italy. Several Italian banks reportedly failed to start trading on Monday as fears over a Greek debt default induced many investors to shed peripheral stocks, including Italian, with banks suffering the most.\nSales orders on Italian stocks, in particular financial stocks, piled up before the market opening. At the start, the sales orders were so numerous that the system couldn't manage to process them, something that often happens when specific news causes a sell-off on a stock.\nSpeaking to Italian daily La Stampa, University of Chicago economist Luigi Zingales noted that a psychological contagion could spread immediately to Italy, because the Italian economy is not growing. \u201cThe question is: Would [Italians] too think to withdraw their money from the banks or not?\u201d\nLa Stampa also reports that \u201cThe Bitcoin fever rises in Greece,\u201d and mentions the recent April Fool\u2019s joke of Greek Finance Minister Varoufakis: \u201cGreece Will Adopt the Bitcoin If Eurogroup Doesn\u2019t Give Us a Deal.\u201d La Stampa describes similar scenarios as \u201cunlikely, but potentially disruptive for Western economic culture.\u201d\n\u00a0Photo\u00a0M\u0101rti\u0146\u0161 Bru\u0146enieks\u00a0/ CC BY-SA 3.0 Unported", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 30}

I think the value of the concept is being affirmed.\u201d\nAs\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine\u00a0reported yesterday, there are indications that some Greeks have been buying up bitcoin for some time now.\nFor Greece\u2019s European neighbors, particularly in Italy, Spain, Portugal and even France, there is growing anxiety about the effects of Greece defaulting on the euro and the subsequent impact on the value of the euro and their savings.\nIn the wake of such economic uncertainty, it would seem more likely that Europeans will be looking more closely at digital currencies as an alternative to fiat currency.\nCapital Controls for Cyprus \u2013 So How Did That Work Out?\nIn 2013, Cyprus was near bankruptcy and the ECB and IMF had proposed a deal that would see banks in Cyprus lose substantial funds. These caused a run on the banks, and the government subsequently imposed capital controls.\nThis devastated Cyprus\u2019s economy, and the controls remained in place for almost two years with the last restrictions lifted in April 2015.\nIn a\u00a0recent article\u00a0in\u00a0Bloomberg Business, Katia Porzecanski says about imposing capital controls: \u201cUnfortunately for Greece, history suggests it hardly ever works.\u201d\n\u201cWhile dozens of countries from Mexico to Iceland and Thailand have imposed such measures since World War I to boost revenue, prop up currencies and hold down interest rates, the International Monetary Fund found that only those few with sound economies and strong institutions succeeded in slowing capital flight.\u201d\u00a0\nSome Bitcoiners weigh in on the crisis\nWhen Andreas Antonopoulos was in Toronto earlier this year he told the audience:\n\u201cI often get asked why I don\u2019t recommend Bitcoin as the answer to Greece\u2019s economic problems. I tell them the citizens of Greece should have the choice to use both digital currencies and fiat currency. Bitcoin alone isn\u2019t necessarily the answer but it can be part of the solution.\u201d\nIf people in Greece want to use bitcoin, they can and will.

Ken Moore, head of Citi Innovation Labs, confirmed that the bank has been looking at distributed ledger technology for the last few years and has amassed a skilled team. They have built three blockchains and a test currency to run across them.\nHeadquartered in Manhattan, Citi is an American multinational banking and financial services corporation. As of January 2015, it is the third-largest bank holding company in the United States by assets and has one of the world\u2019s largest financial services networks.\n\u201cWe have up and running three separate systems within Citi now that actually deploy blockchain distributed ledger technologies,\u201d said Moore. \u201cThey are all within the labs just now so there is no real money passing through these systems yet, they are at a pre-production level to be clear. We also have an equivalent to bitcoin up and running, again within the labs, so we can mine what we call a \u2018Citicoin,\u2019 for want of a better term. It\u2019s in the labs, but it\u2019s to make sure we are at the leading edge of this technology and that we can exploit the opportunities within it.\u201d\nMoore confirmed that Citi is discussing the opportunity to create a state-backed digital currency in a number of different countries with governments and regulators.\nIn May\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine\u00a0reported\u00a0that Citi, persuaded that digital money adoption is inevitable, replied to a U.K. government call for information on digital currencies with a strongly positive position, and advised that the U.K. government should consider issuing its own digital money.\n\u201cDue to the potential benefits, we believe the adoption of Digital Money is inevitable,\u201d noted the Citi document. \u201cWhile we believe that the use of Digital Money is certain, the future of specific cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is less clear.\u201d\nThe idea of a government-sponsored digital currency has been around for quite some time, with proposals for some kind of \u201cFedcoin\u201d and \u201cEurocoin\u201d being floated.Reportedly, IBM is also discussing adaptations of the blockchain technology to create a digital cash and payment system for major currencies with a number of central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve.\nMoore indicated that Citi doesn\u2019t intend to file a patent for its Citicoin technology, which is mostly based on open source components, and stated that Citi is mainly interested in the applications of blockchain technology to cross-border payments and remittances.\n\u201cMost of our efforts have been focused on payments; trade probably being a second runner,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause we are a global network, a global bank, we can look for opportunities to use this technology to move money from country to country \u2013 country A to country B, across our network.\u201d\nCiti is also interested in \u201cbanking the unbanked\u201d \u2013 providing financial services to people currently without access to bank accounts. The bank partnered with Safaricom, the largest mobile network operator in Kenya to process payments using just mobile phones.\nKenya reflects an African demographic of about 40 percent of the population holding a bank account, contrasted with 70 percent to 80 percent mobile penetration, said Citi manager Ireti Samuel-Ogbu. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a bank account,\u201d she said. \u201cIt goes straight into the mobile phone, it goes into a wallet.\u201d\n\nPhoto\u00a0Danesman1\u00a0/ CC BY-SA 3.0 Unported\u00a0", "year": 2015, "month": 7, "day": 1}

The FATF respects the attention of venture capital firms and billionaire angel investors who have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in digital currency startups.\n\u201cVirtual currency has the potential to improve payment efficiency and reduce transaction costs for payments and fund transfers,\u201d the report said. \u201cFor example, Bitcoin functions as a global currency that can avoid exchange fees, is currently processed with lower fees/charges than traditional credit and debit cards, and may potentially provide benefit to existing online payment systems, like PayPal.\u201d\nFATF also explained that digital currencies are one of the only financial instruments that enables the transfer of microtransactions, which optimizes financial processes of small online businesses and individuals with low-cost goods and services.\nMoreover, the advantages of digital currencies for both the unbanked and banked contributed to a significant part of the report, as digital currencies offer extremely low transaction fees, which is very benefitable for those without bank accounts or those using expensive remittance services and bank transfers.\nHowever, FATF finalized the report with a concern that decentralized systems like digital currencies are vulnerable to anonymity risks.\n\u201cFor example, by design, Bitcoin addresses, which function as accounts, have no names or other customer identification attached, and the system has no central server or service provider,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe Bitcoin protocol does not require or provide identification and verification of participants or generate historical records of transactions that are necessarily associated with real world identity. There is no central oversight body, and no AML software currently available to monitor and identify suspicious transaction patterns. Law enforcement cannot target one central location or entity (administrator) for investigative or asset seizure purposes (although authorities can target individual exchangers for client information that the exchanger may collect). It thus offers a level of potential anonymity impossible with traditional credit and debit cards or older online payment systems, such as PayPal.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPhoto\u00a0/\u00a0Photopin", "year": 2015, "month": 7, "day": 1}

Yesterday, Greece became the first developed nation ever to default on the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Hours after Greece missed the deadline for its repayment to the IMF, European ministers will meet to discuss the Greek request for a new bailout,\u00a0BBC News\u00a0reports.\nThe Financial Times\u00a0reports\u00a0that Greek PM Alexis Tsipras seems ready to concede on most outstanding differences between his government and its international bailout creditors. According to\u00a0a leaked letter\u00a0sent late Tuesday night to the heads of the country\u2019s trio of bailout monitors, Tsipras is prepared to accept most of the economic reform proposals issued by the European Commission on Sunday.\nLater on Tuesday, Greece\u2019s Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis indicated that the government might cancel the controversial July 5th referendum if a deal was reached,\u00a0Reuters\u00a0reports.\nOn Monday, Greece\u00a0closed its banks and imposed capital controls\u00a0to prevent financial chaos after the breakdown of bailout talks. Cash withdrawals at ATMs will be limited to 60 euros ($66) until further notice, and transfers abroad will be forbidden. Greece is the second Eurozone country, after Cyprus in 2013, to impose capital controls.\nThough currently it appears that a mutually acceptable, negotiated solution to the Greek crisis might be found, the events of the last few weeks might leave indelible shadows in Europe and elsewhere. In particular, citizens might lose their confidence in the ability of their governments to manage the economy. There are also indications that\u00a0the fear of capital controls may be spreading\u00a0from Greece to Italy and other neighboring countries.\nThe introduction of capital controls in Greece is likely to push people in Europe and elsewhere, not only wealthy investors but also ordinary people, to the conclusion that governments and banks shouldn\u2019t be trusted with their hard-earned savings because they can cut access to their bank accounts anytime. They may then start looking for alternative ways to store their savings, out of reach of predatory central banks.\nThe Wall Street Journal\u00a0reports\u00a0that Europeans are seeking shelter in gold and bitcoin, and the price of both is rising as a result.\nFred Ehrsam, a co-founder of bitcoin exchange Coinbase, said that in the last 48 hours following the breakdown of bailout talks between the Greek government and its creditors, his company\u2019s exchange service has seen a 300 percent rise in Europe. Coinbase\u00a0\u00a0announced\u00a0on its blog that it would charge zero fees for bitcoin purchases with euros this week.\nLast week Coinbase saw 35 percent more activity from Greeks, which could have been much higher if the banks had been open. According to Ersham, \u201cEuropeans, especially those in the periphery countries whose abilities to finance their governments are dependent on help, are starting to take notice of what can happen to the money you thought you had in your bank account.\u201d\nThe Wall Street Journal\u00a0notes that in the meantime, many people in the United States are rushing to gold, according to Terry Hanlon, president of Dillon Gage Metals. Hanlon said that retail investors have been influenced by the images of bank lines in Athens far more than by concerns about monetary policy in the U.S.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to relate to the idea that you could be standing in line and then hear your bank say it is closed and, sorry, you\u2019re not going to get your money,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\u00a0afilitos\u00a0/ Flickr", "year": 2015, "month": 7, "day": 1}

Founded in 2001 by PayPal investor Kevin Hartz and serial entrepreneur Alan Braverman, the company went public in 2013.\n\u201cBecoming part of PayPal represents an exciting new chapter for Xoom, which will help accelerate our time-to-market in unserved geographies and expand the ways we can innovate for customers,\u201d said Xoom President and CEO John Kunze. \u201cBeing part of a larger, global organization will help us deliver the best possible experience to our customers, while maximizing value for our shareholders.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to announce that PayPal is ready to make another area of payments better for people around the world \u2013 international remittances,\u201d added Schulman in\u00a0another post. \u201cToday, this primarily cash-based system of sending money abroad can be time-consuming, insecure and expensive. We believe [the Xoom] acquisition will allow PayPal to quickly expand into the large and growing global money transfer market.\u00a0\u00a0Xoom has what we believe is the most advanced technology platform in this space with a majority of its transactions taking place on mobile devices.\u201d\nThe announcement of the acquisition comes only a few weeks before\u00a0PayPal\u2019s planned split with eBay. The separation will allow the two companies to more effectively pursue distinct operating priorities and strategies and opportunities for long-term growth and profitability.

That is the challenge, and it is a challenge that will come in front of the House. We have always been able, on the authority of the home secretary, to sign a warrant and intercept a phone call, a mobile phone call or other media communications, but the question we must ask ourselves is whether, as technology develops, we are content to leave a safe space \u2013 a new means of communication \u2013 for terrorists to communicate with each other. My answer is no, we should not be, which means that we must look at all the new media being produced and ensure that, in every case, we are able, in extremis and on the signature of a warrant, to get to the bottom of what is going on.\u201d\nCameron revealed that the government plans to bring forward its draft investigatory powers bill in the autumn. The planned ban on strong encryption caused angered reactions from IT and social media companies, and an innovative U.K. social platform developer has already announced its intention to\u00a0leave the country\u00a0for good. Earlier this year, legendary Internet activist Cory Doctorow ofBoingBoing\u00a0fame\u00a0denounced and ridiculed\u00a0a previous announcement of Cameron\u2019s plans.\n\u201cDavid Cameron doesn\u2019t understand technology very well, so he doesn\u2019t actually know what he\u2019s asking for,\u201d said Doctorow. \u201cFor David Cameron\u2019s proposal to work, he will need to stop Britons from installing software that comes from software creators who are out of his jurisdiction. The very best in secure communications are already free/open source projects, maintained by thousands of independent programmers around the world.\u201d\nHe added that the proposed plan is already in place in countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran, and none of these countries have had much luck with it.\nReaders of\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine\u00a0may be wondering how to put together the U.K. government\u2019s staunch opposition to strong encryption and its growing open-mindedness about Bitcoin, which is built upon \u2013 guess what \u2013 strong encryption.\nIn March, the U.K. government\u00a0decided to fund research in digital currencies\u00a0and published a document recognizing their benefits. The government\u2019s document noted that in addition to reducing the costs involved in moving money around the economy, digital currencies can speed up transaction processing times \u2013 the cost and time advantages of digital currencies being most notable in the context of cross-border transactions.\nHow can the U.K. authorities like Bitcoin and hate strong encryption?\nThe answer is that they don\u2019t like Bitcoin. While the U.K. and other governments are recognizing that a \u201csanitized\u201d version the blockchain technology can offer tangible and important benefits, they remain strongly opposed to the libertarian, anti-establishment aspects of Bitcoin.

There are generally two camps of Bitcoin enthusiasts. One side contends that Bitcoin was meant not to be regulated. The other side wants to work alongside regulators to bring about mass adoption of the digital currency.\nCurrently, it is very easy for a wallet manufacturer to make claims about privacy that cannot be easily checked by the average user. Recent scams and fraudulent players in a rapidly growing industry have prompted both sides to reach a consensus; the industry needs a watchdog to protect consumers.\nEnter the Watchmen\nLast\u00a0March\u00a0 Bitcoin Magazine\u00a0covered C4\u2019s announcement of a new Crypto Security Steering Committee consisting of notable security and crypto players in the space.\nAndreas M. Antonopoulos has officially joined C4\u2019s board of directors. Mike Belshe of\u00a0BitGo, Eric Lombrozo of\u00a0Ciphrex, Joshua McDougall and Michael Perklin of C4\u00a0and John Velissarios of\u00a0Armory Enterprise\u00a0have agreed to form the steering committee for C4\u2019s\u00a0CryptoCurrency Security Standard (CCSS).\nThe mission of the steering committee is to \u201censure the CCSS remains up-to-date, neutral and relevant in establishing security standards in the fast-changing world of cryptocurrencies.\u201d\nIn a recent interview, Michael Perklin described the need for a measurement scale when hiring bitcoiners. \u201cHiring managers don\u2019t know how to differentiate if someone knows Bitcoin or they don\u2019t,\u201d he said.\nC4 began with standardizing personnel knowledge with its CBP certification and has expanded with a security standard that includes wallet hardware and software. According to Perklin, the goal of C4 is to provide standards and metrics to the industry.\nC4 is not alone in keeping careful watch over the industry. There are other groups such as the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project and the Digital Currency Council aimed at providing accountability to the digital currency space.\nOpen Bitcoin Privacy Project\nThe OBPP, or the Open Privacy Project, is a Bitcoin privacy research organization lead by prominent figures in the Bitcoin community including Kristov Atlas, a well-known privacy researcher; software designer Justus Ranvier; engineer Daniel Krawisz at Monetas; technical illustrator Samuel Peterson and others.\nRecently, the organization released a report detailing 10 leading bitcoin wallets, setting standards for privacy that they argue are much needed in the space. The bitcoin wallets in the report include Coinbase, Blockchain.info, Mycelium, Darkwallet, Airbitz, Armory, Electrum, Bitcoin Wallet and Multibit Classic.\nAccording to Daniel Krawisz, the goal of OBPP is to \u201cdraw attention to privacy issues in the design of bitcoin wallets and standards, to compare one to another and determine what potential might theoretically be achieved.\u201d\nBy comparing security standards, OBPP hopes to promote competition among manufacturers toward improved privacy features.\n\u201cThe more evident the difference between the privacy functions of different wallets, the more they clearly fall short of the idea, the more effort [manufacturers] will devote to closing gaps,\u201d Krawisz.\nA list of criteria OBPP uses to determine and compare security can be found onGitHub.\nDigital Currency Council\nDCC is a private for-profit organization that offers certification and training for Bitcoin and blockchain professionals.\nAt first glance, the platform appears to be a \u201cLinkedIn\u201d for Bitcoin professionals and boasts impressive numbers. According to David Berger, to date, the DCC has trained more than 2,000 professionals at 300 leading firms. Its membership includes 1,500 professionals across 90 countries. DCC is establishing itself in the industry as a platform for members aimed at setting professional standards and establishing trust within the Bitcoin economy.\nIn the future, DCC plans to identify more ways to support members and bolster the community. DCC recently launched DCC Solutions, which provides customized software solutions for its members.\n\u201cI see our software solutions as a very powerful way that we can support our members and the community into the future,\u201d Berger said.\nSome critics have stated that a for-profit certification organization has an inherent conflict of interest where quality and oversight are rewarded through a simple cash transaction.\nConclusion\nThe average newcomer in the Bitcoin space has no technical background; therefore, there is a clear need for oversight and accountability within the space. Several organizations are stepping up to the plate. All types of organizations, be they for-profit, non-profit or open-source are being welcomed by the community.\nAs of now, there is no clear \u201cwinner\u201d or one acceptable standard over the other. Several accountability authorities could pop up within the space, creating competition among the organizations, spurring greater scrutiny.\nThe question remains; who watches the watchers?", "year": 2015, "month": 7, "day": 3}

He believes that Bitcoin is really an innovation and a disruptive open-source technology for the financial world.\n\u201cIts core is the first successful attempt for a secure and decentralized register,\u201d says Palychata. \u201cIt should be considered as an invention like the steam or combustion engine. \u201d\nBNP Paribas, a French bank headquartered in Paris that was formed through the merger of Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and Paribas in 2000, is one of the largest banks in the world. Based on 2012 information BNP Paribas was ranked as the third-largest bank in the world, as measured by total assets, by\u00a0Bloomberg\u00a0andForbes.\nThough Palychata\u2019s opinions shouldn\u2019t be interpreted as an official position statement from the bank, publication in the official BNP Paribas magazine lends them a certain official aura.\nPalychata considers two possible scenarios for blockchain-based securities markets.\n\u201cThe first scenario creates a total disruption. In its purest form, a distributed blockchain system allows all market participants direct access to the DSD (Decentralised Securities Depositary), to the exchange and to the post-trade infrastructure (clearing and settlement),\u201d he writes.\u00a0\u201cIf this setup develops then existing industry players might be redundant.\u201d\nIt\u2019s surprising that a representative of a major bank even considers the possibility of this scenario, which would be a nightmare for the financial establishment. However, Palychata continues, \u201cgiven the challenge of keeping the private key of the account safe, it is possible that investors will entrust an authority to safe-keep the private keys. It is also possible that custodians will be responsible for the application layer over the blockchain or that they will launch their own network.\n\u201cThe second scenario is an integration within the post-trade ecosystem,\u201d he says. \u201cThe distributed ledger might only be the next generation of IT infrastructure. In this scenario custodians or settlement infrastructures might use the blockchain to record the ownership and trades between themselves; however, end investors will still need to use a custodian to have access to the market.\u201d\nIt appears that this second scenario is becoming closer with the recent initiatives of companies such as Nasdaq and Overstock. Nasdaq partnered with San Francisco-based bitcoin API startup Chain to\u00a0implement\u00a0blockchain technology in its Nasdaq Private Market. And Overstock\u00a0became\u00a0the first company to offer qualified buyers the option of purchasing corporate bonds that will trade using Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain protocol.\n\u201cThe ledger will only be accessible to authorized market participants,\u201d Palychata continues, exploring the second scenario. \u201cExisting actors will remain in charge in this scenario. However, their level of service could change and they may deploy new services that they could not in the past because the investments required were a huge barrier to entry.\u201d\nPreviously in November, Palychata published an article\u00a0arguing\u00a0that bitcoin and other digital currencies could shake up traditional banking and financial services.PYMNTS\u00a0noted\u00a0that Palychata\u2019s article, which publicly suggested that \u201cthe development of an alternative to the current banking system is under way,\u201d was remarkable because it came from one of the world\u2019s largest banks.\nPhoto\u00a0jyhem\u00a0/ Flickr\u00a0", "year": 2015, "month": 7, "day": 6}

Negotiations with the European Union (EU) and the IMF are stalling, and Greek voters on Sunday rejected new bailout terms.\nOn Monday, Greece\u00a0closed its banks and imposed capital controls\u00a0to prevent financial chaos after the breakdown of bailout talks. Banks and ATMs are still working on a very limited basis, which makes things difficult for families and pensioners. For businesses and entrepreneurs who depend on cross-border sales and imported goods or services, the situation couldn\u2019t be worse: They are unable to pay their suppliers abroad because cross-border bank wires are suspended, and the have only limited access to their sales income. Even the best-performing Greek businesses that are still making sales abroad can\u2019t use their hard-earned cash.\nWith the banking system locked down, capital controls prevent Greek citizens from accessing cash and this disrupts the economy. The Irish company\u00a0Spartan Routehas come to the rescue of Greek businesses with an innovative service proposal: They will invoice their Greek clients\u2019 foreign customers in euro, collect the payment, and send bitcoin back to Greece.\nTheir proposal to Greek businesses is simple and crystal clear: 1. Invoice Spartan Route for your exports, 2. Deliver your goods as normal to your customer through your current supply chains; 3. Spartan Route pays you with bitcoin; 4. Spartan Route invoices your customer for euro.\nSpartan Route believes that the Greek people are being politically and financially blackmailed by creditors due to the economic stranglehold on the country\u2019s financial system. The company\u2019s blog states Spartan Route\u2019s position\u00a0loud and clear:\n\u201cThe Greek people now witness the noose of economic and political oppression dangling at the hands of a Mr. Jean Claude Junker and his bandit of EU mercenaries. The sovereignty of the nation has continuously been diluted by the stark sanctions imposed by the EU and the ECB. The current creditors\u2019 demands on the Greek nationals, if accepted, will propel Greece further into an amputated brand of sovereignty.\n\u201cBitcoin can help the people of Greece,\u201d continues Spartan Route. \u201cThe Greek people are wrestling their sovereignty back from the EU, and Greek nationals can chart their own economic course through the adoption of Bitcoin. Bitcoin can also help the Greek export industry to stay intact, economic sanctions make it near impossible from many Greek business to operate and survive. The adoption of Bitcoin can help transcend these trade barriers, opening up Greek exports to the world once more.\u201d\n\nPhoto\u00a0(CC)\u00a0Brian Solis\u00a0/ Flickr", "year": 2015, "month": 7, "day": 6}

The European authorities should consider the results of the referendum a wake-up call \u2013 the Greeks have renewed a mandate to Tsipras and his Syriza-led government to adopt a firm position in negotiations, and unambiguously shown that they are ready for Grexit \u2013 the forced exit of Greece from the Eurozone and perhaps even the European Union itself \u2013 if the negotiations fail.\nGrexit could have catastrophic consequences for Greece. But the consequences for the European Union could be equally catastrophic, because Grexit would establish a dangerous precedent. In fact, as shown by the results of recent local, national and European elections in the U.K., Spain, Italy and other countries, European citizens are more and more dissatisfied with the Euro and the E.U. Therefore, Grexit could start a domino effect from which it could be very hard for the E.U. to recover, and E.U. authorities are expected to take that into account in forthcoming negotiations.\n\u201cYou made a very brave choice,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Tsipras in a TV address to Greeks. \u201cThe mandate you gave me is not the mandate of a rupture with Europe, but a mandate to strengthen our negotiating position to seek a viable solution.\u201d The Greek P.M. said he wants to keep Greece in the E.U. and the Eurozone, and promised to reach an agreement with the country\u2019s creditors in two days, which might be overly optimistic.\nFormer Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, who said before the referendum that he would resign in the case of a Yes vote,\u00a0resigned anyway\u00a0in an unexpected move. Varoufakis\u2019 resignation is to be interpreted as a conciliatory move toward Greece\u2019s creditors. In fact, he had played an aggressive \u201cbad cop\u201d role in the negotiations, and even\u00a0accused Athens\u2019 creditors of \u201cterrorism\u201d\u00a0the day before the referendum. It\u2019s easy to read Varoufakis\u2019 resignation as a performance staged to offer a face-saving exit (pun intended) to Europe, and open the door to further negotiations.\n\u201cI was made aware of a certain \u2018preference\u2019 by some Eurogroup participants, and assorted \u2018partners,\u2019 for my\u2026 \u2018absence\u2019 from its meetings; an idea that the prime minister judged to be potentially helpful to him in reaching an agreement,\u201d Varoufakis said in a statement\u00a0reported\u00a0by\u00a0Reuters.\nReuters\u2019 columnist Hugo Dixon\u00a0notes\u00a0that the Eurozone partners and the International Monetary Fund aren\u2019t likely to offer Greece a deal significantly better than the proposal rejected by the Greek voters. Tsipras \u201cmight therefore be tempted to introduce a new currency, either to replace the euro or to run alongside it,\u201d speculates Dixon. \u201cNot only would this enable him to reopen the banks, it would also allow him to pay out salaries and pensions. The new currency would immediately fall to a big discount to the euro, perhaps half its value.\u201d\nIn June\u00a0Bloomberg Business\u00a0reported that German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said that\u00a0Greece may need a parallel currency\u00a0if talks with creditors fail, according to sources familiar with Schaeuble\u2019s views. Former Greek Finance Minister Varoufakis\u00a0proposed\u00a0a parallel IOU-based currency, dubbed Future Tax Coin (FT-Coin), similar to a cryptocurrency in some aspects. Varoufakis is not impressed by bitcoin as a currency, but he is persuaded that its underlying technology could be put to effective use in troubled economies.\n\u201cGreece Will Adopt the Bitcoin If Eurogroup Doesn\u2019t Give Us a Deal,\u201d reads an April Fool\u2019s joke\u00a0posted by Varoufakis on Twitter.

The $4 million fund will be operated by former Google product manager Ruby Lee, and the founder of bitcoin and dogecoin transaction service Backlash, Roneil Rumberg.\nTo help early-stage startups from losing equity in its first few funding rounds, the firm is set to take a different approach for its investments. Instead of taking equity from its startups, the startups will issue a debt-like account called uncapped convertible notes to the VC firm, which can be reclaimed by the startup at any time.\nMidha explained that such an approach will assert less pressure on the startups for another funding round, as it will not provide a startup with a specific valuation. Additionally, the startups can choose to reclaim the convertible notes and convert it to stocks completing their next funding round.\nAs of now, the firm has decided to take a more proactive approach and has begun to reach out for possible candidates, TechCrunch reported, \u201cMidha will spend around a half hour to 45 minutes meeting with companies and then say they will give a final verdict on an investment in around 72 hours. The goal is to be as 'founder friendly' as possible \u2014 though, in theory, most firms would say they would be shooting for that goal.\u201d\nThe establishment of the Edge fund follows the recent announcement of a popular startup accelerator, Boost VC\u2019s announcement to end its focus on Bitcoin startups.\nAs Bitcoin Magazine reported on June 8, Boost VC stated that the firm will diversify its investments toward virtual reality technology, while still continuing to fund Bitcoin startups. Last year, Boost VC promised that the firm will accelerate and fund 100 Bitcoin companies by 2017. So far, Boost VC has successfully funded more than 50 startups and is set to fund more in its new startup program called Tribe 6.\nAs KPCB shifts its focus on hot startups in the Bitcoin and drone industry, the firm may possibly work with Boost VC to find potential candidates for its investments. Currently, the possible candidates are said to be BlockCypher and OneName, both of which have been part of the firm\u2019s podcast series and were funded by Boost VC.\u00a0\nPhoto\u00a0Doc Searls\u00a0/ Flickr", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 23}

Elliptic has harnessed the underlying technology supporting the visualization to deliver a full suite of anti-money laundering (AML) services. The API will enable real-time compliance, by alerting recipients of bitcoin payments linked to known thefts, illicit marketplaces and other criminal activity.\nThe visualization identifies more than 250 of the largest entities and the historical transactions between them. Illicit marketplaces and money laundering services are identified by name, while standard entities are described purely by their primary business to protect privacy.\n\u201cIf digital currency is to take its legitimate place in the enterprise it inevitably must step out of the shadows of the dark web,\u201d said Elliptic CEO James Smith. \u201cOur technology allows us to trace historic and real-time flow, and represents the tipping point for enterprise adoption of Bitcoin. We have developed this technology not to incriminate nor to pry; but to support businesses\u2019 anti-money laundering obligations. Compliance officers can finally have peace of mind, knowing that they have performed real, defensible diligence to ascertain that their bitcoin holdings are not derived from the proceeds of crime.\u201d\nThe Elliptic AML suite will be available in July to a select group of early customers.\nElliptic is the founding member of the U.K. Digital Currency Association (UKDCA), working with the U.K. government and financial regulators to help shape a regulatory framework for digital currencies.\nThe Swiss company Chainalysis offers a similar service that provides financial institutions with the means to obtain regulatory compliance through real-time analysis of the blockchain, including an API for sophisticated in-depth real-time blockchain transaction analysis. Chainalysis customers \u2013 including regulatory entities, law enforcement and financial service providers \u2013 can obtain insight on all transactions recorded in the Bitcoin blockchain and use tools to determine the origin of the bitcoin held by any address. Unlike Chainalysis however, Elliptic has strict privacy controls in places, only reporting a users risk profile to customers but not the specific parties transacted with.It is evident that\u00a0\nBitcoin is moving toward mainstreaming and regulations, and the services offered by Elliptic and Chainalysis are here to stay, but such services meet opposition from an important part of the Bitcoin community. In April, a leaked Chainalysis roadmap was received with anger and hostile comments, and it seems likely that the Elliptic announcement will cause similar reactions.\n\u201cElliptic\u2019s founding principle is to bring confidence and certainty to enterprises working with bitcoin,\u201d said Smith. \u201cWe were the first bitcoin custodian to provide comprehensive insurance, the first to be Big Four-accredited and now the first to visualize the flows of bitcoin and explode the anonymity myth of the blockchain.\u201d\nIndeed, every transaction and the full transaction history of any bitcoin address are permanently recorded in the blockchain and open to analysis. The illusion of anonymity stems from the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin addresses, which are not explicitly associated to their owners, but sophisticated blockchain analysis tools such as those provided by Chainalysis and Elliptic can often de-anonymize bitcoin users.", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 23}

The MIT Technology Review published a review, titled \u201cLeaderless Bitcoin Struggles to Make Its Most Crucial Decision,\u201d of the pros and cons of the proposed hard fork.\nRecently several of the larger mining pools, amounting to around 60 percent of the total mining capacity, have agreed to a compromise: The maximum block size would be increased to 8 megabytes instead of 20. NewsBTC reported that, even though the 8 megabyte block size is smaller than the initially 20 megabyte block size proposed, Andresen is happy about the proposal and there seems to be a consensus.\nNow BitTorrent creator Bram Cohen has weighed in on the debate. In a Medium post titled \u201cBitcoin\u2019s Ironic Crisis,\u201d Cohen criticizes the proposals to increase the block size and warns, in very blunt terms, that Bitcoin is heading toward an unexpected crisis \"of being undermined by a developer who\u2019s gone rogue, using his political influence to convince vendors that an upcoming minor problem will be a major crisis, getting them to accept his own extraordinarily bad pet solution to that problem, and as a result hurtling the whole ecosystem towards potential disaster.\u201d\nThe rogue developer is, according to Cohen, Gavin Andresen.\u201cGavin didn\u2019t invent Bitcoin,\u201d says Cohen. \u201dHe isn\u2019t even a Bitcoin developer anymore. He resigned his position as lead developer a year ago, and has been largely inactive since. Using a voting process, or even a system of rough consensus among core developers would cause his proposal to be quickly rejected. It\u2019s only the exertion of outside political force which has forced it to be taken seriously.\u201d\nThe political influence that Cohen is denouncing could be the MIT Digital Currency Initiative, which Andresen and other Bitcoin developers joined as soon as it was launched and is positioning itself as a de-facto governance body for Bitcoin technical development.\nCohen thinks that proposed extensions to Bitcoin should go through a sort of voting process where miners indicate that they\u2019re willing to accept them. Concerning the specific case of the block size limit, he thinks there are no problems, let alone urgent problems, that must be solved. The only thing that would happen when the block size limit \u2013 which is a limit on the bitcoin transactions rate \u2013 is reached is that the transaction fees would go up.\nThat, according to Cohen, is not a bad thing. On the contrary, he thinks that high transaction fees would be the first clear evidence of Bitcoin providing real value instead of just being a vehicle for speculation, and it would also lead to miners directly earning more money.\nCohen\u2019s article will certainly put even more steam in the Bitcoin block size debate. Cohen may have been too blunt in his criticism of Anderson, but the opinion of the creator of BitTorrent, the first building block of the developing P2P Internet and a Bitcoin precursor, certainly deserves full consideration.\u00a0Photo\u00a0Abstract blocks\u00a0/\u00a0Photopin", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 23}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nIn one of the more exciting developments in the Bitcoin space so far this year, noted Bitcoin angel investor and entrepreneur Roger Ver has given his blessing to a Bitcoin 2.0 application, and it\u2019s one that some may have overlooked in the past. Truthcoin, a Bitcoin sidechain designed by Yale Department of Economics Researcher Paul Sztorc, is described as a \u201cpeer-to-peer oracle system and prediction marketplace.\u201d\nThe platform is a decentralized method of bringing external data, such as the price of gold or the weather in a particular city, to the blockchain, which can then be used as the basis for complex smart contracts\n.Roger Ver\u2019s backing of Truthcoin\nVer is excited about what may become possible through the use of a working implementation of Truthcoin, and shared the following statement via email: \u201cI really do think that decentralized prediction markets may be the most important invention since Bitcoin, and will certainly change the way our world works.\u201d\nThe perpetual Bitcoin angel investor has been silently funding a C++ programmer who is building a working Truthcoin implementation using a fork of the original Bitcoin codebase. Some of this early code is now available on GitHub. Ver also shared some complimentary remarks in regard to Truthcoin Creator Paul Sztorc\u2019s understanding of the technical challenges ahead.\n\u201cCompared to Paul, I don\u2019t think there are many people on the planet\" who could have created something like Truthcoin, Ver said. \"Before meeting him, I already understood some of the benefits and exciting things that distributed prediction markets will bring to the world, so upon meeting Paul, he seemed like the right person to help make it a reality, so I agreed to get involved.\u201d\nNo empty promises\nSztorc has made it a point to avoid any sort of Truthcoin crowdsale without an actual product to back the offering, and he has noted his discontent with other Bitcoin 2.0 crowdsales in the past. The Truthcoin creator plans to insist that a crowdsale does not take place until the software has been built, tested and operational for \u201cat least three months\u201d without any need for a hard fork.\nIt should be noted that anyone who wishes to place a bet on the Truthcoin network will be able to do so with their bitcoin-denominated sidechain tokens. Any crowdsale for this project would likely involve the sale of votecoins, which are used by individuals who wish to vote on the outcomes of real life events. Holders of votecoins who honestly report the outcome of an event are then rewarded with fees generated from the participants in a particular prediction market.\nIn addition to a possible crowdsale, the monetization model for this project also includes the expected growth in the bitcoin price for holders of the digital money.\nWhen will Truthcoin be available?\nIn an email to Bitcoin Magazine, Sztorc noted that Truthcoin is currently a testnet \u201caltcoin\u201d with only two people running nodes. \u201cIn fact, it really isn\u2019t much of anything yet,\" he added.\nThe votecoin in this current setup are not intended to have any value and should be viewed in a manner similar to testnet bitcoin. Sztorc also wrote about how Truthcoin might earliest become a Bitcoin sidechain.\n\u201cWhat would (obviously) be really cool is if, at some point, someone from Blockstream would rip it open and graft in something to make this version a \u2018testnet sidechain\u2019 so that testnet coins could hop over,\u201d he said.\nThe Truthcoin team doesn\u2019t have the time to deal with sidechain compatibility right now, and Sztorc even mentioned it \u201cmight interfere with early testing.\u201dSztorc also did not want to reveal any kind of release date as he \u201c[doesn\u2019t] endorse that type of forecasting.\u201d In the past, Sztorc has poked fun at Ethereum's Frontier release due to prediction markets at Fairlay.com that seem to indicate that the release won\u2019t happen until after August 1. This is far off from the project\u2019s original launch date.\nFor now, anyone interested in the project can visit the Truthcoin forums, read the latest version (1.4) of the Truthcoin whitepaper, or follow Sztorc's blog.", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 23}

According to the company, Case already has gained\u00a0the interest of well-established financial institutions that hope to implement the system to handle sensitive user data.\nThe Case hardware wallet has several features and functionalities that complete a biometric data security and authorization system. Specifically, by using three main components of the device \u2013 a fingerprint scanner, a camera and a GSM chip in the hardware wallet \u2013 transactions are authorized or sent with fingerprint information, which are then processed on\u00a0Case\u2019s servers. Once the verification in its servers is complete, the transactions are signed by the Case servers and propagated to the Bitcoin network.\nThe Case wallet uses a multisig solution with three different\u00a0private keys to ensure the security of bitcoin in case of a hacking attack or a data breach. One private key is kept by the user, the second is held by the company, and the third backup\u00a0is controlled by a cryptographic key management solutions provider, Third Key Solutions, founded by Andreas Antonopoulos and Pamela Morgan.\nAccording to the Case team, the same system that is used by Case bitcoin hardware wallet could be implemented to grant access to data and verify transactions in platforms of financial institutions, banks and organizations. The company is currently in the process of seeking\u00a0partnerships with financial organizations to increase consumer adoption of its multi-layered biometric data security devices and system.\n\"As more important assets move to the blockchain (contracts, property and identity), having a completely secure way to store and transfer those assets becomes even more paramount,\" Case CEO Melanie Shapiro told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\"We're interested in not only servicing the consumer holding bitcoin, but also providing the banks using blockchain technology the power to manage who has the authority to execute transactions,\" she said. \"We've built something far more robust and institution-friendly than traditional 2FA tokens.\"\nAs global financial organizations, banks and stock markets have begun to show interests in using the blockchain technology to optimize their systems, Case plans to continue searching for ways to integrate its biometric security system to settle transactions in many applications.\n\u201cThe recent announcement that the Nasdaq is piloting blockchain technologies for different use cases underscores the promise of the technology, and Case is poised to provide trusted, decentralized and biometrically secure signing of those and similar transactions,\" Shapiro said in a statement.\n\"We\u2019re looking forward to providing uncompromised security and ease-of-use for bitcoin buyers, sellers and users, to unlock the potential of bitcoin and blockchain technologies,\" Shapiro said. \"Making highly secure signing and authentication available across a variety of applications is just the beginning.\u201d\nCase enters a market currently led by two\u00a0popular hardware wallets commercially available, Ledger wallet and Trezor, both of which recently released multisig updates earlier this year. However, Case wallet is unique in the marketplace because of its\u00a0simplicity and features that do not require users to link the wallet to another device, such as a smartphone or computer, in order to set up a secure multisig wallet.The company has also appointed Stephen Schultz as CTO as part of the plans for the new investment and to increase market adoption of its bitcoin hardware wallets. With over 20 years of experience in different technological platforms, Schultz is set to oversee the development of the company\u2019s biometric data based security system and solutions.", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 24}

Exponential Finance 2015 examined how rapidly accelerating technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, crowdfunding, digital currencies, and robotics are rapidly disrupting businesses throughout the financial industry.\nThe Singularity University\u2019s news portal Singularity Hub published a conference wrap-up titled \u201cExponential Finance: Who Will Be the Instagram or Uber of Finance?\u201d Instagram and Uber are examples of what Peter Diamandis, co-founder and executive chairman of Singularity University, calls the disruptive potential of digital technology.\n\u201cInstagram was acquired for a billion dollars the same year Kodak went bankrupt,\u201d writes Jason Dorrier. \u201cUber is a five-year-old transportation company worth $40 billion, and they don't own a single car or bus.\u201d\nAccording to Diamandis, the blockchain will spark similarly disruptive innovations.\n\u201cAt its core, bitcoin is a smart currency, designed by very forward-thinking engineers,\u201d said Diamandis. \u201cIt eliminates the need for banks, gets rid of credit card fees, currency exchange fees, money transfer fees, and reduces the need for lawyers in transitions \u2026 all good things. Most importantly, it is an \u2018exponential currency\u2019 that will change the way we think about money.\u201d\nIn his talk at Exponential Finance, Diamandis added that simple and ubiquitous apps based on blockchain technology will change the banking industry and the insurance industry.It\u2019s difficult to predict which companies will become the Instagram and Uber of exponential digital finance. Some of the established big players in the financial industry will probably continue to play an important role\n.Using again the analogy with digital photography, while Kodak went bankrupt because it didn\u2019t adapt fast enough, Canon transitioned to become a major player in the digital camera market. But the biggest and most disruptive innovations could come from applications and business models that few anticipate today, CNBC's Bob Pisani pointed out.\nJust a few imagined the iPhone in the '60s, \u201cReality has surpassed science fiction,\u201d said Pisani.Abra, a blockchain company that wants to take a slice of the $550 billion global remittance market, is showing what can happen when several digital technologies converge in one product. Combining an Uber-like peer-to-peer network with smartphone technology and the blockchain, Abra permits sending cash as easy as sending a text message.\nAt Exponential Finance, Abra\u2019s founder Bill Barhydt estimated that we're three years away from modern smartphones becoming ubiquitous in the developing world. At that point, it's possible many of the world\u2019s unbanked billions in developing countries will skip traditional finance, a little like how they leapfrogged landlines for cell phones.\nBarhydt stated that Abra aims to be the Uber of digital cash. Abra, which allows people to send and receive money without a bank account, is building a global network of \u201chuman ATM machines,\u201d empowered end-users who don\u2019t even have to understand Bitcoin to use the underlying blockchain technology embedded in the Abra app.\nBarhydt described Abra as \u201cthe world's first digital cash-based peer-to-peer mobile money transfer network.\u201d The Abra app allows anyone with a smartphone to send money to any other smartphone anywhere on the planet any time of day. The goal of Abra is to be as \u201cprivate as traditional cash, but without introducing any financial intermediary.\u201d\n\"Traditional banking is really good at serving the global 5 percent to 10 percent of consumers who reach a certain income level,\" Barhydt told CNN Money. \"The reality is, the majority of the planet is a cash-based economy, and banking doesn't work for those people.\"\nCNN Money\u2019s take is that Abra makes banking more accessible while completely cutting out the actual bank \u2013 and bank accounts may be the next thing to go obsolete.\nBlythe Masters, the former J.P. Morgan star who now leads Digital Asset Holdings, a technology company that uses distributed digital ledgers to address operational challenges and settlement latency in both digital and mainstream financial assets, said that financial blockchain applications will be measured in the trillions.\nAugur, a fully-decentralized, open-source prediction market platform based on blockchain technology intended to revolutionize forecasting, decision-making and the manner in which information consensus is collected and aggregated, was selected as one of the five finalists in the \u201cBreakthrough\u201d category at the XCS Challenge at Exponential Finance 2015.\nA short video on the conference website shows the enthusiastic reactions of many attendees after the conference.\n\u201cI feel we\u2019re on the cusp of a step function in technology,\u201d says Catheryne Nicholson, founder and CEO of blockchain API provider BlockCypher.", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 23}

This new platform and API will allow businesses to send cross-border payments of all sizes to their users en masse with nothing more than an email address, phone number, or Bitcoin address on file.\nMassPay also allows businesses to make these mass payments without having to worry about the volatility risk associated with bitcoin, and the platform could be seen as highly advantageous for a variety of online industries.\nHow it works\nSnapcard has provided Bitcoin Magazine with an internal company brief on how the MassPay system works:\n A merchant or business decides it wants to integrate with the MassPay API, and Snapcard credits its account with the company\u2019s local currency. When a user or contractor triggers a payout via the API, the MassPay system is activated and sends a fiat-denominated amount of bitcoin to the recipient via an email, phone number or Bitcoin address. The user or contractor is then notified that a payment has been received and will have the option to keep the bitcoin or withdraw it to his or her local currency for a 0.25 percent fee. The withdrawal process can take anywhere from three hours to three days depending on the country, and the fiat currency will be made available in a user\u2019s bank account in most cases. Converting to fiat is currently available in 26 countries, although Snapcard hopes to expand this functionality to an additional 20-30 countries by the end of the year.\nLaunching with the Tango Card rewards platform\nFor the launch of their MassPay system, Snapcard has partnered with Tango Card, which is the largest rewards-as-a-service platform in the world. Tango Card has helped thousands of companies reward their users with gift cards in the past, but this new partnership with Snapcard will provide a more dynamic, flexible payout option for their clients\u2019 users.\n\u201cTango Card was able to use our new MassPay API to allow their users to receive Bitcoin Rewards at an email address, phone number or a Bitcoin address, all without taking on any of the currency risk,\u201d Snapcard CEO Michael Dunworth explained.\nMore uses of this platform\nDunworth also described the original inspiration for MassPay, which involves a problem that affects a few different online industries. \u201cWe saw the opportunity for MassPay when we noticed partners being unable to pay out customers efficiently,\u201d he said.\nWhether it's a rewards program for user activity or mass payments to publishers on a digital ad network, making small payments on a massive scale has been difficult in the past. This is Snapcard\u2019s area of focus with MassPay.\nFrom Snapcard\u2019s perspective, the first four key areas where the MassPay platform will be useful are the mobile gaming industry, marketplaces, digital content sales and ad networks.\n\u201cDigital content companies are now able to streamline their payouts to all of their freelancers, artists and designers all with a simple API call,\" Dunworth said. \"Additionally, we've been working closely with a lot of game developers to make sure the MassPay API will plug in nicely to their gaming ecosystems.\u201d\n", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 23}

With the number of unique data sources available to these data-focused companies, the possibilities for analytics and selling that service to others seems exponential. And, with the rise of worldwide ledger-based systems like that of Bitcoin and other blockchain-based technologies, the lines are blurring between what's kosher in extrapolating data from the public domain and what isn\u2019t.There are plenty of reasons to gather large amounts of information, especially in realtime. The ability to identify trends, track data from its source to its endpoint, and making inferred correlations between data points is highly sought after \u2013 especially the storing of that data for future analyses and historics, primarily in the business/financial world.But, what about the data on the most private things we do in our everyday lives?

Surely there exist financial institutions and businesses that monitor that information for security/reporting purposes? And surely they report any suspicious activities to the appropriate authorities for matters of national security (see\u00a0KYC/AML).Many regulations already exist that require this level of oversight for financial institutions, especially those in the United States. These data analytics help the government and other agencies have more oversight into a hyper-connected populous.Fair enough.But what about when all that information is already in the public domain, and not private? Bitcoin and its distributed public ledger system allows for the entirety of all transactions on the network a certain modicum of \u201cpseudo-anonymity.\u201d Every transaction you make on the network is publicly available, but your particular \u201cwallet address\u201d and identity is uniquely known only to you and whomever else you transact with \u2013 or the custodial wallet service you may be using, i.e. Circle or Bitreserve. But if you\u2019re using a newly generated address from your personal home wallet to send funds, or using stealth addresses (learn more here), you are more masked from analytics-based systems that would seek to interpret and make inter-correlations in regard to your transactions.But who\u2019s working on those types of systems? Bitcoin Magazine had a chance to speak with Bill Gleim,\u00a0Co-founder\u00a0of Coinalytics, who took the time to describe Coinalytic\u2019s realtime analytics platform in his own words:\u201cI realized, as an early victim of bitcoin thefts, there needed to be a better way to understand blockchain activity,\" he said. \"My original motivation is a mental framework where participants justifiably trust the blockchain and other cryptoledgers with which they interact, particularly in terms of privacy and security.\u201dWhat does \u201cunderstand blockchain activity\u201d mean, though? Gleim went on to explain his plans for the long-term:\u201cWe want to continue providing actionable insights for customers with widely-varying requirements,\" he said. \"Currently, our data intelligence layer is focused on financial transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, and we are excited to expand this data intelligence layer to areas like the Internet of Things and smart contracts in the future.\u201dHmm. Sounds, interesting, definitely. But, let\u2019s go a bit deeper.One of the key components of Coinalytics is a system they are calling \u201cJarvis\u201d. Jarvis, is described on the Coinalytics site as: \u201cA visual and analytical workspace to perform in-depth investigations across the Bitcoin blockchain. Built on top of the Coinalytics back-end, the user interface allows you to visually interact with an enriched version of the blockchain and focus on transactions and entities of interest to analyze relationships and uncover hidden patterns.\u201dNow it\u2019s starting to make sense. Coinalytics plans to data-mine the Bitcoin blockchain in order to \u201cuncover hidden patterns,\u201d aka monetize the act of making sure you and businesses are not transacting with bad actors or known criminals. Or by helping larger financial institutions better adhere to differing regulations passed at a state and national level as they transition into adopting digital currencies such as bitcoin, blackcoin, and litecoin.This solution would ultimately allow banks to better trust the individuals they might be interacting with on the blockchain, or aid a governmental body tracking down a series of \u201cbad\u201d transactions to a particular e-criminal.To be fair, the data is, in fact, publicly open to interpretation. Surely someone was bound to come along and analyze it on an enterprise level. We asked Gleim specifically whether he planned to work with any governmental agencies with his platform.\u201cYes,\" he said. \"We provide data intelligence software to all kinds of companies and organizations.\u201dSurely there will be individuals who will be wary and suspicious of such a service, bad actors or not. However, people always find a way to circumvent potential privacy busters such as these.Luckily, with the current release of BlockStream\u2019s open source project, \u201cSidechain Elements\u201d; the ability to use bitcoin as anonymously as cash will still be possible via sidechains. As well as many other current services that seek to improve the anonymity of bitcoin transactions, such as Dark Wallet, coin mixers, etc. Rest assured, there will always be a solution cropping up that further protects your privacy; that's the power of open source.We asked Gleim what his personal views were on Bitcoin anonymity and services as whole.\u201cAs a proponent of personal privacy, I believe anonymity is desirable in many circumstances, and in other circumstances privacy, traceability and reputation are\u00a0more important,\" he said. \"I would like to see the market needs for Proof of Identity, Proof of Privacy and even Proof of Anonymity fulfilled by Bitcoin.\u201dGleim\u2019s position as Technical Lead at Coinalytics is no surprise. He also has held positions at companies including Google, Motorola, and bitcoin alternative Ripple Labs. It\u2019s great to see that someone who\u2019s developed a system like Coinalytics/Jarvis also understands the importance of anonymity, and how that will play part in its growth, as businesses are built on providing services the blockchain itself cannot fulfill.The bitcoin transactional flow is shaping up to look like this: major financial institutions transacting openly and transparently via the public ledgers to be regulated accordingly in real-time. And individuals transacting publicly or anonymously via sidechains, stealth addresses or whatever anon-related service they\u2019re privy to.This contrast is similar to that of current debit/credit card purchases and cash. You give up privacy for mainstream purchases with debit/credit card providers, and then anything private or sketchy can be done via cold, hard cash.The whole idea of Bitcoin becoming a global financial system is slowly starting to seem a lot more feasible.It\u2019s great to see the services and systems built around the bitcoin blockchain mature and grow to not only work alongside regulators, but to also see other services/systems emerging to equally subvert them at the same time. And, for those gripping to the eternal libertarian roots of Bitcoin, this is not a fond farewell to the anti-government/privacy-centric ethos you all know and love. This is just a technological compromise.For now.\u00a0Images courtesy of Coinalytics.co\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 24}

Unlike decentralized Bitcoin apps, this platform would use hosting providers, like the ones that run many\u00a0websites, to host the decentralized applications \u2014 not a decentralized network. The Codius project was devised to make the process of setting up your smart contract app in a hosting provider automated and streamlined.\nWhile relying on centralized entities that require trust may not bode well with many bitcoin advocates \u2013 unlike Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work system \u2013 Codius is much cheaper both in terms of computing power and electricity. (Both systems have advantages and disadvantages).\nWhen\u00a0Ripple\u00a0announced the project, it said an industry like the one that was created around digital currencies would emerge around smart contracts. That vision hasn't materialized yet, although\u00a0there has been recent interest in the space with two smart contract startups having just raised multiple-million dollar funding rounds.\nIt did get inquiries from a \u201csignificant\u201d number of developers and companies, but ultimately, Ripple Labs saw the low demand as not enough to justify continuing the project.\nThe future\nAlthough\u00a0Codius 1.0 was released earlier this year, much remains in the way of the advancement of the smart contract platform. In order to make the process further automated and secure, hosting providers will need to verify the programs\u00a0being run by these smart contracts by certifying cryptographically what code they are running.\nOther challenges remain in the highly fragmented world of online standards. Codius relies on being able to automatically pay hosting providers, but without a clear Web payment standard (like Bitcoin), that is a continued challenge. Ripple Labs did say it was looking forward to completion of the work by the World Wide Web Consortium on this front. The other challenge\u00a0cited by the company was differences in hosting providers\u2019 APIs, causing problems for Codius.\nRipple Labs seems optimistic that a lot of the problems will\u00a0be solved\u00a0as the industry matures. The company\u00a0said it will continue working on its own distributed applications (possibly for all those banks it has been partnering with recently) and advised others doing the same, or interested in doing so, to join the Codius mailing list.", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 24}

The memo is accompanied by a report, issued by E.U. law enforcement agency Europol, stating that 84 accounts in the country (which hasn\u2019t been disclosed) have been flagged as suspect, and 52 are under surveillance and investigation.The poster says that an earlier related report from the national financial institute is available online.\nThe report is in Dutch and was released on May 21, 2015 by the Dutch Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) -- which likely implies that the undisclosed country is The Netherlands.The report mentions that bitcoin is used by technology enthusiasts and speculators, but also by criminals who use the digital currency to fund illicit activities and launder money. The report mentions terrorism and child pornography. In 2014 the FIU investigated 75 cases in which bitcoin plays an important role. The results, which led to new investigations, have been shared with foreign financial intelligence units.The poster says that the bank received a list of IBAN accounts that are already constantly monitored because they belong to high-volume traders and exchanges such as Kraken, Bitstamp and BitcoinD.\nThe bank has to report any transfer above \u20ac1,000 that involves those accounts. The bank must also report accounts that receive more than \u20ac10,500 per year (outside of salary) if it suspects that the funds originate from bitcoin exchanges.Of course, anonymous reports should always been taken with a grain of salt, but this warning is substantiated by the openly available report by the Dutch FIU, and it makes sense. Now that governments have taken notice of the fact that bitcoin exists and is used by the people, it seems evident that they are trying, or will try, to force the banks to monitor and report transactions to and from bitcoin exchanges, as well as any other transactions that may be linked to bitcoin.\nThe stated objective of the governments is to fight money laundering and organized crime, and of course they use hot trigger words such as \u201cterrorism\u201d or \u201cchild pornography\u201d to persuade the citizens that what they do is right. Almost everyone hates terrorism and child porn, and most people don\u2019t condone money laundering and large-scale tax evasion. But it seems odd that relatively small transfers of \u20ac1,000 should be considered suspect.All bitcoin users should know that if they transfer more than \u20ac1,000 to or from a bitcoin exchange they could be investigated or monitored. That\u2019s likely to annoy those who are paid in bitcoin (for perfectly legitimate work) and must cash out to pay bills and buy food.\nA good\u00a0way to avoid surveillance, which is becoming easier, is to pay directly in bitcoin for goods and services wherever possible.", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 25}

Furthermore, banks and financial institutions require a long list of documents and qualifications for bank accounts, and credit cards including two government approved licenses, tax income of at least two years, and financial statements from at least two different financial institutions.\nPierna Caballero, the co-administrator of BitINKA told Bitcoin Magazine \u201cIn some countries where Bitinka operates, people are educating themselves recently to use Bitcoin and they are realizing that is something very easy and also is a currency that people themselves control. In Peru for example this is something new and gradually has captured the public interest, in Bolivia it is prohibited Bitcoin as a payment method, so Bitinka works as a virtual wallet for businesses and users affiliates.\u201d\nBitcoin is widely used in countries like Argentina, where well-established bitcoin payment processing startups and exchanges like BitPagos are based in. BitPagos is one of the most prominent bitcoin merchant payment platform which raised over US$600,000 in a funding round participated by Tim Draper and Barry Silbert. The startup is already close to processing US$1 million per month.\nHowever, bitcoin is still unfamiliar to a large number of people in the continent. BitINKA aims to help those unfamiliar with the benefits of the digital currency to easily accept, trade and receive payments using bitcoin.Caballero explained, \u201cBrazil is a country that already use Bitcoin in different ways, as an investment, savings, etc. in Peru just a few people know Bitcoin, Peru is a country where new things are more difficult to be accepted so what we are doing with Bitinka is helping Bitcoin to incorporate in people's lives.\u201d\nINTERVIEW WITH THE FOUNDER\n\n", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 25}

TMesh and Telehash, a lightweight interoperable protocol with strong encryption to enable mesh networking across multiple transports and platforms, are available on Gitbub as open source software.\n\u201cBlanket a factory in sensors, or control the streetlights of an entire city \u2013 our standalone networks span miles and last for years, all without Wi-Fi or cellular,\u201d says the Filament website. \u201cWe've combined end-to-end encryption (telehash) with private-key crypto hardware to provide ultra-secure, decentralized communications between millions of devices. By enabling operations on the Blockchain, we've made it possible to generate new, recurring sources of revenue by selling access to your devices or data.\u201d\nBefore the conference, O\u2019Reilly Radar noted that Filament and IBM are exploring how specially designed decentralized ledgers can be used to enable devices to communicate service needs and other information among their owners and vendors for household, commercial and industrial purposes.\u00a0 IBM is building a similar proof-of-concept system for the next generation of the IoT, dubbed Autonomous Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Telemetry (ADEPT).\nFilament, after raising a $5 million Series A Round led by Bullpen Capital, started to ship an early version of its hardware and to provide services to pilot customers. It lists many possible applications for Taps networks in industrial sectors where risk and operational efficiency is critical to success. Applications range from locating thousands of bicycles across an urban bike-sharing service to monitoring weather and soil conditions across large farms, or avoiding collisions between vehicles on remote worksites.", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 26}

Magnr, a company dedicated to providing Cryptocurrency Financial Services, is trying to change this by allowing the first-ever blockchain-based \u201csavings accounts.\u201d\u00a0\nMagnr currently operates across two verticals: trading and saving.\n\u201cMagnr allows users to independently verify the safety of their deposit on the blockchain's public ledger,\u201d says CEO Joe Lee. \u201cAdditionally, the interest payout is calculated from blockchain data. This lets users verify they are being paid the correct amounts. This is the first time that savings accounts have received a fintech makeover.\n\u201dMagnr was created from the founding team of BTC.sx. It is a new, rebranded version of the BTC.sx trading platform. BTC.sx Bitcoin Trading Platform has brokered more than 60,000 trades since the introduction of its leveraged trading service in 2013.\nMagnr generates interest from traders, which is partly paid out as interest to savers.\n\u201cOne of blockchain's greatest innovations is its immutable ledger,\u201d says Lee. \u201cWhen developing our interest-bearing product, we asked ourselves on a technical level how we could rely on the blockchain as an external database as much as possible. To calculate interest payable, we take the timestamp from each client deposit directly off the blockchain. At the end of each month, this allows us to pro-rata interest calculations to whole 24-hour periods on the realtime transaction record that is the blockchain.\n\u201dThe Magnr platform doesn\u2019t require a settlement period or a wait time for them to receive funds as payments to client accounts can happen in real-time. This also allows for the saver to check the on public blockchain for payments made to his or her Magnr account.\nThe Magnr team is founded by investment banking veterans. Joe Lee, formerly of Barclays Bank and Macquarie Group, first discovered Bitcoin in 2011. Joe began trading bitcoin and turned $100 into $200,000. This profit was then used alongside seed-funding to start BTC.sx. Colin Kwan, COO, worked at the senior management level at UBS and Deutsche Bank. He ensures the company's products have institutional-grade quality and compliance.\n\u201cOur team is currently focused on product refinements and back-office operations,\u201d says Lee. \u201cExperience from the banks and investment banks we used to work with has taught us the value of building out a solid back-office operation as a matter of importance. We find that client trust starts with prioritization of the fiduciary responsibility we have when handling our client bitcoins. As we seek to engage with institutions and regulators worldwide to push the adoption of digital currencies, a well-managed operation speaks loudly for itself. This shows proof that business can be built in a trustworthy way using blockchain as its core rails.\u201d\n\"Fintech startups have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to revolutionize banking,\" Lee said. \"We are very excited to be pioneering digital currency savings accounts.

Last year a team accredited to observe the 2013 municipal elections in Estonia \u2013 the only country to run Internet voting on a wide scale \u2013 revealed that they observed election officials downloading key software over insecure Internet connections, typing PINs and passwords in view of cameras, and preparing election software on insecure PCs.\nNorway also canceled trials of e-voting systems in local and national elections, concluding that voters' fears about their votes becoming public could undermine democratic processes.\nThere are,\u00ad\u00ad however, increasing examples of political organizations and technology startups experimenting\u00a0with secure digital voting systems based on the use of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain technology. Last year Denmark\u2019s Liberal Alliance became the first political party to vote using a blockchain-based system for its internal elections. Similar systems have since been adopted in Norway and Spain and the movement is gathering momentum in the United States.\n\u201cThere is a common misconception that voting cannot be done online in a secure way. However, the introduction of blockchain technology is changing the conversation,\u201d Adam Ernest, CEO of Virginia-based FollowMyVote \u2013 an organization committed to developing an online open source, transparent voting platform \u2013 explains.\nJust as Bitcoin users make transactions by sending the digital currency to the recipient\u2019s digital wallet, blockchain voting systems involve creating wallets for each candidate or option in an election. All voters are then allocated a digital \"coin\" that represents one vote, which they can cast by sending their \"coin\" to the wallet of their choice.\nAs in a bitcoin transaction, the entire process is recorded in the blockchain public ledger, meaning that unlike most current elections, a voter can verify that his or her vote was actually counted.\nWhile the lack of anonymity in the Bitcoin system is a drawback for adoption in voting platforms, the use of anonymizing software can help ensure that voters\u2019 identities are not revealed.\nThe New York-based V-Initiative is working on delivering open-source, fraud-proof, fully anonymous digital voting solutions based on the blockchain and uses zero-knowledge proof cryptography allied with IP masking software such as the \"TOR\" program to safeguard voter anonymity.\nFor many digital voting advocates, the end goal is \"liquid democracy\" \u2013 a combination of direct and indirect democracy whereby all citizens have the potential to vote on every issue but can dynamically delegate some or all of these votes to others that they feel are better qualified to vote.\nErnest notes that this concept is gaining much traction in countries such as Norway, Iceland and Germany. FollowMyVote, in partnership with\u00a0BitShares\u00a0and\u00a0Cryptonomex, Inc., is working on a voting platform that is integrated directly with the\u00a0BitShares 2.0 Smartchain\u00a0that supports this use case.\nDespite the positive reception in parts of Europe, Ernest is quick to point out that a number of obstacles remain along the road toward a fully digital democratic system.\u201c\nPushing for provably honest elections in the U.S. and abroad, we have a tremendous amount of money and influence stacked against us,\u201d he said.\nAs a result, FollowMyVote is changing its approach. Instead of trying to lobby election officials or legislators whom they feel have no incentive to improve the voting process in the U.S., it is preparing to launch an educational marketing campaign targeted directly at the voter in an attempt to get them to lobby the government.\nErnest says he is confident that once voters are better informed about the benefits of a blockchain-based online voting system \u2013 from convenience and cost-effectiveness to security and transparency \u2013 governments will have little choice but to adopt these systems.\n\u201cI firmly believe that in the future, voting will be done from our smartphones and our votes will be stored securely on the blockchain,\u201d he said.\u00a0Photo\u00a0London elections - e-count scanners\u00a0/\u00a0photopin", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 27}

The company bought San Francisco-based Hyperledger and Budapest-based Bits of Proof for undisclosed amounts.\n\u201cHyperledger and Bits of Proof add valuable new dimensions to our product offering and great talent to our team,\u201d said Masters. \u201cWe build tools to help clients harness the power of distributed ledgers to serve their own customers. We integrate financial infrastructure with a variety of innovative new technologies inspired by the blockchain. Different ledger technologies serve different purposes and all of those we integrate with are additive.\u201d\nHyperledger, a finalist in the SWIFT Innotribe startup challenge, developed an innovative distributed ledger to allow banks and other financial institutions to clear and settle transactions in realtime. The company\u2019s technology enables financial institutions to create multiple private blockchains across a known group of participants. Unlike other distributed ledgers, Hyperledger does not have an inbuilt cryptocurrency and uses a proven consensus algorithm capable of thousands of transactions per second.\nBits of Proof developed and deployed an enterprise level server to integrate blockchain technology into financial applications.\nHyperledger CEO, Dan O\u2019Prey, will become Chief Marketing Officer of Digital Asset, and CTO Daniel Feichtinger will join the senior engineering team. T\u00e1mas Blummer, founder and CEO of Bits of Proof, has joined Digital Asset Holdings as Chief Ledger Architect.\nAccording to information disclosed to Bloomberg Business by a person familiar with the matter, several large investors have expressed an interest in funding Digital Asset Holdings and entered private negotiations.

Available in private beta, Blockstack.io gives financial institutions a stack of inter-operable components to build on, including a private, hosted blockchain, a colored coin issuer for representing assets, a framework for smart contracts using oracles and multi-signature transactions, and the ability to plug in external open source components.\n\u201cThe initial benefit of a private blockchain is simple: a financial institution can accelerate their learning about blockchain technology and prototype blockchain-based applications quickly and easily,\u201d states the Blockstack product and service announcement. \u201cThe ultimate benefit of a private blockchain is that it gives enterprises a choice of infrastructure: whether to run an application on a public blockchain or run on a private blockchain with a group of known counter-parties.\u201d\nBlockstack includes critical functionality for financial services: managing time-dependent financial transactions like coupon payments for bonds, ensuring complex compliance requirements from multiple groups in an organization, and scaling up the infrastructure to handle millions of transactions at low latency.\nThe Blockstack platform is designed to work with technologies designed for Bitcoin Core. As improvements are made to Bitcoin, they can be rolled in Blockstack so that it stays current with the latest technology.\n\u201cWhen you have this private blockchain that\u2019s shared by a number of financial institutions, all you\u2019re doing is just keeping records of the transactions and who owns what,\u201d Shiau said. \u201cWhat\u2019s nice about the blockchain is you can do that in real time.

Elsewhere, an estimated $4 billion is lost through inefficiency in global collateral management within the asset leasing sector. These are two of several opportunities identified in the paper, which also outlines opportunities for banking innovation based on the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d (IoT), smart data, distributed ledgers and frictionless processes beyond payments and consumer credit.\nA problem identified by the paper is that financial technology developers and startups (fintechs) are still operating only at the edges of banking. To help engineer more fundamental improvements to the banking industry, they must now be invited inside, to contribute to reinventing core infrastructure and processes in the financial system. According to the paper, such reinvention can only be brought forward by a collaborative endeavor of banks and fintechs working together as partners.\n\u201cFunds alone are not enough,\u201d said Mariano Belinky, managing principal of Santander InnoVentures. \u201cTo move to the next phase of evolution in financial services, banks need to invite fintechs to work within our industry, even inside our own businesses. Santander is committed to achieving innovation by partnering with fintech startups. That means investing in funding but also giving access to our expertise, as well as utilizing our client base and our own innovation initiatives.\u201d\nDistributed ledger technology could save banks $15 billion-$20 billion per annum by 2022\nIn contrast to today\u2019s transaction networks, distributed ledgers eliminate the need for central authorities to certify ownership and clear transactions. Distributed ledgers can be open, verifying anonymous actors in the network, or they can be closed and require actors in the network to be already identified \u2013 which seems to be the approach currently favored by most banks and mainstream financial institutions.\nThe paper acknowledges that Bitcoin represents the best existing example of distributed ledger, and goes on to identify important advantages of distributed ledgers: near-realtime and irrevocable settlements, robust P2P transactions verified by tamper-proof networks without central management cost overheads, and permanent records of all transactions that can be monitored and audited by all participants. According to the paper, it\u2019s only a matter of time before distributed ledgers become a trusted alternative for managing large volumes of transactions.\nThe paper notes that international payments remain slow and expensive, and significant savings can be made by banks and end-users bypassing existing international payment networks, and suggests that distributed ledger technology could reduce banks\u2019 infrastructure costs attributable to cross-border payments, securities trading and regulatory compliance by between $15 billion and $20 billion per annum by 2022.\nThe message to banks and to fintechs is the same, concludes the paper: \u201cIf you can\u2019t beat them, you should join them to achieve Fintech 2.0.\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 16}

DMD is soon to celebrate its second birthday.\nWith almost 2 years of ongoing development, Diamond Coin\u2019s philosophy is to create long term stability through sensible management and an ever expanding network of supporting services. Diamond Coin strives to be a stable and secure digital currency with 50% interest annually and\u00a0advanced security protocols and algorithms. The team\u2019s unique approach overcomes challenges like inflation control, price volatility, security and sustainability by incentivizing holding rather than spending. Diamond Coin\u2019s future plans involve an entire ecosystem of Bitcoin 2.0 decentralized services with an increasing spectrum of digital currency financial instruments. DMD stake holders are automatically eligible for 50% interest per annum in a straightforward process known as \u201cminting\u201d.\nWhen minting the DMD adopter obtains some coins, and holds them in the Diamond Wallet for a given period of time which in turn generates new coins. Minting withdraws the DMD from the supply chain for staking, contributing to price stability, as well as securing the network through improved Proof-of-Stake technology.In order to control DMD inflation and bring it in line with the annual rate of physical gold extraction, minting rewards will be successively reduced over the coming decades. The early adoption period for Diamond Coin has been set to last for a few years; a time frame that is uncommon in the digital currency industry. This requires a long term commitment that will translate into a slow but cumulative effect of organic growth.\nSuch a model is also a pledge on behalf of the DMD developers to think strategically and long term.To deal with price volatility the Diamond Coin ecosystem currently has two key mechanisms to help ensure the value remains stable. The first is the Diamond Multipool that allows participants with their own computer hardware to mine currencies with almost any algorithm and receive DMD in return. The second service Diamond Cloud Mining enables anyone to collectively mine BTC in the cloud and convert this into DMD payouts. The system has proven to be adaptive, sustainable and rewarding for its participants.\nThe Diamond Coin Foundation developers treat network security as a continuous challenge that needs to be addressed and developed to remain a step ahead of potential security threats. Improvements in protocols and software optimizations provide a streamlined client for the end user. Employing a Hybrid Security of two separate protocols working in tandem is the cornerstone of Diamond Coin\u2019s security. To further strengthen security Diamond Coin implements \u2018Reactor\u2019, a protection tool that provides the benefit of additional safeguards along with the price stability mechanism of Diamond Cloud Mining.", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 16}

A report by top insurance market operator Lloyd\u2019s, published on June 12 and targeted at insurance service providers, highlights the key risk factors for the insurance of Bitcoin operations.Lloyd\u2019s, an insurance market located in London, is one of the best-known names in the insurance sector. It operates as a marketplace within which multiple financial backers come together to pool and spread risk. Lloyd's itself does not underwrite insurance business, leaving that to its members.\nInstead, the society operates as a market regulator, setting rules under which members operate and offering expert advice and centralized administrative services to members.The report suggests that the technology, procedures and practices that underpin Bitcoin are maturing.\n\u201cNevertheless, legitimate concerns remain over security risk and the potential for criminal exploitation,\u201d notes the report. Lloyd\u2019s does not, therefore, endorse the insurance of Bitcoin operations, but rather \u201caims to contribute to the assessment of these risks for insurance purposes.\u201d\nLloyd\u2019s shares a positive assessment of the benefits of Bitcoin, now widespread in the mainstream financial sector. \u201cIn essence, Bitcoin offers a low-cost, relatively fast means to transfer value anywhere in the world; the only real constraint is the availability of an Internet connection. As such it offers a lower-cost alternative to established banking and money transfer systems, which require a bank account and/or the payment of fees,\u201d states the report, adding that Bitcoin can bring global payment technology to populations unable to access or afford conventional banking methods.\nThese benefits could be significant for a wide range of users around the world. Insurance, according to Lloyd\u2019s, can be a component of responsible risk management to enable the next phase of Bitcoin\u2019s evolution. At the same time, Lloyd\u2019s is persuaded that the security risk of Bitcoin operations will never be reduced to zero. It can, however, be mitigated by the use of professional security measures and the adoption of recognized standards for secure bitcoin storage. The security measures required for Bitcoin should include both the physical and personal protection measures routinely applied for cash, and the cybersecurity measures required for sensitive data.Lloyd\u2019s also invites the Bitcoin community to cooperate with law enforcement to prevent Bitcoin from becoming \u201csynonymous with crime\u201d in the public perception.\nThe Lloyd's report includes a thorough description, by Jerry Brito and Peter Van Valkenburgh of Coin Center, of operational risks associated with theft. Brito and Van Valkenburgh cover both local risk \u2013 the risk that thieves steal bitcoin from specific users or operators, and global risks \u2013 for example, 51 percent or Sybil attacks.In conclusion, Coin Center advises that insurers and industry observers keep tabs on whether a business is employing modern controls such as multi-sig, cold storage and hybrid wallets.Garrick Hileman, of the London School of Economics, and Satyaki Dhar analyze risks not related to malicious intent, including market volatility and regulatory uncertainty, which should be factored in when assessing the overall risks of Bitcoin operations.\nFor example, European authorities have discouraged banks from transacting with bitcoin or interacting with Bitcoin companies, which has limited the ability of Bitcoin businesses to connect with the broader financial system and grow. The conclusion of Hileman and Dhar is that there are no clear solutions on the horizon for these risks.It\u2019s to be hoped that the publication of this report by a leading insurance expert will facilitate the consolidation of best practices in risk assessment, and help Bitcoin businesses in obtaining insurance for their operations.\u00a0Image via Lloyds.com", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 15}

DNotes is a second generation digital currency focused on long-term adoption, scalability, and solving real-world issues.\nDNotes co-founder Alan Yong is pleased to be joining the Innovation Spotlight: Digital Currencies panel at this year\u2019s Silicon Dragon event, to be held in New York at the NASDAQ on June 22nd. Alan Yong is an experienced tech entrepreneur having founded personal computer company Dauphin Technology in 1989. Francesco Rulli, President of bitLanders and bitCharities, will also be part of the panel, along with Sarah Martin, VP at Digital Currency Council. The panel will be moderated by Porter Bibb, Managing Partner at MediaTech Capital Partners.\nStable Bitcoin alternative DNotes is focused on long-term adoption and solving real-world issues for the unbanked and people worldwide from all walks of life. DNotes\u2019 ecosystem includes the world\u2019s first Cryptocurrency Investment Savings Plans (CRISPs) for retirees, employees, students, and children worldwide. CRISPs include a 100% deposit guarantee and bonus interest for retirement CRISPs participants. DNotes also funds cryptocurrency neutral site CryptoMoms in order to aid women\u2019s participation in cryptocurrencies.\nBitcoin has correctly been credited as the most disruptive technology in the monetary system since the debit card. However, Bitcoin has been hit with countless negative headlines and has arguably settled with a very limited purpose as a speculative trading vehicle. Some believe Bitcoin is failing to meet the full function of money and gain mass acceptance as it is too costly to acquire, and too volatile as a store of value and medium of exchange.\nBut Bitcoin\u2019s ground-breaking technology laid the foundation for improved and more advanced cryptocurrencies that have a real chance to make it into the mainstream and revolutionize the monetary system just as the debit card once did. The main innovation stemming from Bitcoin is trustless transactions, meaning transactions are fully decentralized and do not rely on a central bank or government. Bitcoin also introduced the primary innovation of blockchain technology; a public ledger where all Bitcoin transactions are recorded indefinitely together with all Bitcoin \u2018blocks\u2019 that have been mined to secure the network.\nDNotes is the second generation Bitcoin alternative digital currency taking full advantage of the pioneer Bitcoin\u2019s innovation while avoiding the pitfalls. It was clear early that DNotes strives to maintain reliable long-term appreciation building stability, trust, and currency value in line with fundamental value.\nDNotes is a currency with a purpose with global initiatives to help solve global problems. There are currently 2.5 billion people worldwide that do not have a bank account, insurance, or are under-served by banks and financial service companies. DNotes is beneficial for the unbanked as it does not require a stable government, includes inexpensive transactions, minimal exchange fees, and near zero remittance costs for sending money to any country. No ID is required for people who do not have one or do not trust their governments. DNotes has the potential to change the wealth of nations and their citizens by enabling anyone, anywhere to tap into the emerging wealth creation opportunities provided by digital currency.\nBitcoin will most likely go down in history as one of the greatest technology revolutions in history. Bitcoin as a currency is an integral part of the technology pack, powered by the Blockchain as the most innovative protocol of decentralized distributed consensus ledger ever conceived. DNotes, designed from the ground up with a purpose as the stable trustworthy digital currency for everyone, is destined to possibly become the global Digital Currency of the future with lasting value. With an ecosystem that currently consists of DNotesVault, Cryptocurrency Investment Saving Plans and CryptoMoms, DNotes is the currency with the highest potential for mass global acceptance. The DNotes ecosystem consists of highly scalable buildings block to expand rapidly on a global scale at the most opportune time.\nAbout Alan Yong:\nDNotes Co-Founder Alan Yong is a well -regarded visionary since the early days of personal computers. He founded Dauphin Technology in 1989, which had contracts with the US Department of Defense, and is best known for creating the Dauphin DTR, the most powerful window-based miniature computer that competed head-on with Apple\u2019s Newton computer that became the Apple Iphone as we know it today. In 2007, Yong co-founded Smokeys Daylily Gardens, one of the largest daylily growers in the world. Smokeys Daylily Gardens is the first merchant to accept DNotes as payment for its products.\nAbout DNotesVault and CRISP:\nDNotes is a currency for everyone \u2013 unborn to most senior, rich or poor.

For the first time, DNotes\u2019 CRISPs and DNotesVault allow anyone worldwide to take advantage of the unprecedented opportunities provided by digital currency\n.About CryptoMoms:\nIn 2014 DNotes founded Cryptomoms.com, an online community to encourage and assist women to participate in the emerging world of cryptocurrencies overwhelmingly dominated by men. Surveys from 2014 show that 95% of cryptocurrency participants are male even though women account for 50% of the buying power. CryptoMoms is a platform fully equipped with a forum, chat, information pages and a full guide on how to store, buy, and sell digital money. It is clear that in order for digital currencies to become truly mainstream the gender imbalance must be corrected.\nAbout Silicon Dragon:\nSilicon Dragon is a news, events, and research group covering innovation and investment hubs in the Silicon Valleys of the world, and provides insights to strategize and profit in the world\u2019s top tech innovation centers.

Customers can spend bitcoin to pay phone bills, electricity bills, school fees, credit cards, tax payments and more. Founded in 2014, the company has processed more than $500,000 of Australian bills using bitcoin.\nBPAY is an electronic bill payment system in Australia which enables payments to be made through a financial institution's online, mobile or telephone banking facility to organizations which are registered BPAY billers. BPAY is a registered trading name of BPAY Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cardlink Services Limited. Cardlink is owned equally by the four major Australian banks: Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank Limited and Westpac Banking Corporation.\n\u201cToday BPAY offers fast, secure and convenient bill payments through over 150 Australian financial institutions, such as banks and credit unions, covering over 95 percent of the consumer banking market,\u201d states the BPAY website. \u201cThat means most Australians can now enjoy the convenience of paying their bills with BPAY. And with BPAY offered on over 44,000 bills (via 22,000 billers and more than 22,000 Sub Billers), these businesses cover a spectrum of industries with over 354 industry (ANZSIC) codes represented in the BPAY biller file. We now accept more payments than ever. In fact, each month we help process more than 30 million bills worth more than $24 billion \u2013 with around 92 percent of these paid through a customer\u2019s online or mobile bank.\u201d\n\u201cAll of our customers find Bitcoin a fast, secure and convenient way to pay bills,\u201d said Alexiuc in a recent interview published on the Australian edition of CIO Magazine. \u201cYou can see from our graphs page that our customers are paying all sorts of everyday bills, from toll road charges to tax bills. Many use Living Room of Satoshi to pay off their credit cards with Bitcoin, which opens up an even greater range of places to spend bitcoin.\u201d\nHe added that, in Australia, by far the biggest impediment to the adoption of Bitcoin is the recent GST (Goods and Service Tax) ruling. According to Alexiuc, Bitcoin is a nascent and unprecedented technology that regulators are still struggling to comprehend, and therefore the software developers in Australia need to continue to innovate and demonstrate the utility of bitcoin, which will in turn shape regulation. It needs to be easy for businesses to transact completely in bitcoin \u2013 to sell products in bitcoin, pay their staff in bitcoin and purchase supplies in bitcoin.", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 15}

Now, Bitcoin Tracker One, a product launched by the Swedish company XBT Provider AB, is available to investors in 179 countries via Interactive Brokers.\nBitcoin Tracker One is an \u201cExchange Traded Note\u201d (ETN) designed to provide investors with convenient access to the returns of the underlying asset, U.S. dollar (USD) per bitcoin, less investor fees. The average dollar exchange rate of bitcoin from the exchanges Bitfinex, Bitstamp and OKCoin provides the underlying reference price. A detailed breakdown of the value of Bitcoin Tracker One is given here.Interactive Brokers LLC (IB) is a U.S.-based online discount brokerage firm. It is the largest U.S. online brokerage firm by number of daily average revenue trades, as well as the leading foreign exchange broker.

{"title": "Augur Launches Alpha Version of Prediction Market Platform", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/augur-launches-alpha-version-prediction-market-platform-1434506163/", "birthday": "Jun 16, 2015  9:56 PM EST", "date": "2015-06-17 02:56:00", "content": " CryptoBrief.com\nAugur, a decentralized platform allowing individuals to create prediction markets on a vast array of topics, announced today that it was launching its alpha test.\n\u201cTraditionally, prediction markets have fallen short due to their need for volume in order to be valuable forecasting tools,\u201d explained Jeremy Gardner, the Director of Operations at Augur. \u201cHaving a global, unstoppable, blockchain-based prediction markets platform means anyone in the world with internet can connect to Augur.\u201d\nHowever, Augur is not, itself, a prediction market. Rather, it is open-source code for a prediction markets platform. In essence, the team doesn\u2019t actually operate the software nor does the team own it.\nOne of the concerns for prediction markets is that they will come under assault from the Commodities Future Trading Commission, which is very strict about new markets being launched. Other prediction markets, such as Intrade, have been forced to ban United States users from the site. Gardner doesn\u2019t believe this will be an issue.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just writing open-source code for a [prediction market] platform. That is constitutionally protected activity,\u201d he explained. \u201cIn addition to speaking to a former CFTC Commissioner, my lawyer and myself have spoken to one of the CFTC\u2019s top prosecutors along with a couple of the great guys at Coin Center. What we\u2019ll likely see is the CFTC going after market-makers like the RIAA went after torrent uploaders, not after Bram Cohen and BitTorrent.\u201d\nHow Augur Works\nThe platform works by allowing anyone to download the client where they are then able to create a market. A market could be a scenario such as: \u201cWill aliens come to Earth tomorrow?\u201d\u00a0\nThe user would then set the deadline for the outcome as well as determine what the trading fees are for that specific market.\nPeople would then bet on the likelihood that aliens were going to actually come to Earth tomorrow. In the event that no aliens came, the vast majority that likely bet against it happening would get their reward. However, if the majority of people bet that aliens wouldn\u2019t come and then they actually did, the group that bet that they would come could wind up making a significant amount of money depending on how big the market was.\nUsers are able to make bets with cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin or ether. When the deadline for the outcome has come and gone, those that participate in the upcoming crowdsale will determine the outcome of the bet. These people who participated in the crowdsale will own a token referred to as REP. This token allows the holders to act as \u201cjudges\u201d of the outcome.\nIn the above example, if aliens did, in fact, come to Earth, those with REP would say yes and the rewards would be allocated accordingly. The trading fees, which the market maker sets up, would then be split evenly between the market maker and the reputation users.\nCrowdsale\nIn an effort to raise funds to continue working on the platform, the team has deployed a live-action model for crowdfunding. All told, there will be 11 million REP software licenses, which are what allow for the completion of all markets. The founders will receive 16\u00a0percent\u00a0and the Forecast Foundation will receive 4\u00a0percent. The other 80\u00a0percent\u00a0will be sold to people that want to be reputation users.\nIn the live-action model, the amount of licenses a user gets is directly contingent on the amount of money donated in comparison to the total amount donated. If there are 8,800,000 total pieces (80\u00a0percent\u00a0of the total 11,000,000 REP) and someone donates $10, they would have all 8,800,000 licenses. However, if someone else came along and also donated $10, now both parties have 4,400,000 licenses.\nThe idea here is that a user gets a percentage of the licenses directly correlated to the percentage that the user\u2019s donation was in comparison to the total pot.\nTo encourage early buying of the licenses, Augur will give bonuses to people at the start. The schedule of the event and the bonuses are:\n July 1-5: 10% July 6-15: 7% July 16-31: 4% August 1-15: 0%\nUsers can participate with cryptocurrencies through Shapeshift.io or by purchasing bitcoin from exchanges/broker-dealers.\nThe Future of Augur\u00a0\nThis open-source software is completely free for users. However, Gardner revealed that the plan is to create a for-profit product similar to the model that\u00a0OpenBazaar recently announced.\n\u201cWe will create a search website with for-profit [expectations],\u201d Gardner said. \u201cThere\u2019s also a huge amount of investor interest. Correspondingly, we\u2019ll be raising a round for a for-profit sometime in the fall.\u201d\nFor now, though, users are allowed to download the Alpha tool and start experimenting with creating markets.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 17}

It will serve to be a center point for anyone currently involved in digital currency or interested in learning more.\nCiTi has already made a name itself in its nearly 20 years of serving the local South African community where it has been a pioneer of new technologies. The nonprofit organizes tech meetups and events, such as a recent virtual reality community gathering, provides resources to developers and runs an incubator for local tech startups.\n\u201cIn South Africa, we are faced with different challenges from the rest of the world,\u201d says Sonya Kuhnel, organizer of the recent Bitcoin Africa Conference and collaborator in the BitHub launch, \u201cand understanding our market is as important as the technology behind it. BitHub will guide and mentor entrepreneurs whilst they develop and shape their Bitcoin businesses to fit our unique market needs.\u201d\nThe BitHub\u2019s first event happened today in their already established co-working space, Bandwidth Barn, where future events will also be located. The event featured several speakers from the local digital currency industry and community, including Roslyn Lavery from PayFast and Andrew van der Nest from Landmark Computers. The institute also announced it will be bringing one Bitcoin developer into their startup incubation program.Both have been instrumental in the rise of bitcoin in South Africa. Landmark Computers, a South African computer retailer, was among the first businesses to accept bitcoin in the country and continues to support its adoption. PayFast, on the other had, is the first and only payment processor to accept the digital currency, making merchant adoption much easier. The company has played a role in supporting other digital currency businesses, such as South Africa-based mobile bitcoin wallet Zapgo.\nToday\u2019s event is just one of many that CiTi plans on holding about digital currency. Each event will aim to educate participants about how digital currencies work and what they are used for; the relevant regulations startups working in this sector need to comply with; and connecting out with the country\u2019s business leaders and demonstrating how the technology could be useful to them. The institute believes the currency and technology has many potential use cases in the African country.\n\u201cWe believe that fintech innovation is going to be the cause of considerable disruption to the traditional banking model in Africa,\u201d says Ian Merrington, CEO of CiTi. \u201cWe particularly believe that innovation within fintech has the ability to dramatically reduce transactional fees and lower barriers and the cost of remittance. The decentralized blockchain technology also has huge transformative potential. Reducing corruption is one potential application that comes to mind!\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 17}

The platform is now built on a system known as \u201cGraphene toolkit,\u201d which is developed by an independent blockchain development company founded by the core developers of BitShares, called Cryptonomex Inc.\nWith the implementation of a new crypto-technology called SmartChains, the soon-to-be released BitShares 2.0 reportedly is set to have the \u201cSpeed of the NASDAQ,\u201d with a new \u201chigh-performance protocol and engine, capable of handling over 100,000 transactions per second.\n\u201dTo test its efficiency and capability of the technology, the BitShares team had set up a pilot blockchain with 200,000 accounts, and issued an asset to every account, which involved around a million operations/transactions. After the creation of the blockchain, the BitShares team timed the duration of reindexing the blockchain without signature verification.\nAccording to the press release of BitShares, \u201cA single core of a 2.6 Ghz i7 is able to validate 10,000 signatures per second. Today's high-end servers with 36 cores (72 with hyper-threading) could easily validate 100,000 transactions per second.\u201d\nCriticisms and Improvements\nPreviously, BitShares received criticisms from the cryptocurrency community and blockchain developers that the slow and inefficient performance of the platform negatively affects user experience, and that the model object fails to engage real-world usage.\nAs a response to the suggestions, the core developers of BitShares have designed a high performance blockchain technology specifically for cryptocurrencies and smart contract transfers. According to its developers, the newly built platform is designed to confirm transactions in just one second, allowing the system to process more transactions per second than MasterCard and VISA combined.During the beta operation of BitShares, users also indicated two major problems with the previous version of BitShares:\n Nonstandard market matching algorithm discourages traders Insufficient incentives for new stakeholders to help grow the network.\nIncentives and Rewards\nTo better incentivize and reward its users, BitShares has also introduced a referral rewards program, built directly into the software. Recognizing that the value of the BitShares network is derived from its user base, the platform is set to reward its users that encourage others to join the network in an automated way.\nBitShares 2.0 is set to enter a public testing period for community feedback upon its completion, which will continue until everyone in the community is satisfied with the platform.\nBitShares core development team is also planning to outsource some of the platform\u2019s operations to Cryptonomex Inc., to create a \u201cmore robust, sustainable, and fair\u201d smart contracts platform.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 16}

Many people came to the conclusion that governments and banks couldn\u2019t be trusted with their hard-earned savings, and started looking for alternative ways to store value, out of reach of predatory central banks. Bitcoin came to the rescue, and its price shot up as many people rushed to take money out of their saving accounts and buy bitcoin instead.\nThe recent spike in the exchange rate of bitcoin, which went up 10 percent in the last 24 hours \u2013 something unheard of in the last few months of relative stability \u2013 has been linked by many analysts to the more and more frequent rumors of Grexit \u2013 the spectrum of the possible exit of Greece from the eurozone and perhaps from the European Union (EU) itself.\nBefore a meeting of eurozone finance ministers, seen as the last realistic chance to reach a deal before Greece has to pay the International Monetary Fund (IMF) at the end of June, Greek PM Alexis Tsipras showed no sign of bowing to demands for cuts in pensions and increases in VAT, The Guardian reports. Instead, Tsipras accused the fund of \u201ccriminal responsibility\u201d for the situation and said lenders were seeking to \u201chumiliate\u201d his country.\nYanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, challenged the EU leaders. \u201cGreece will only commit to [spending cuts and reforms] if Europe agrees to a debt restructuring, investments and an end to the liquidity crisis,\u201d he said. The EU leaders, especially Germany\u2019s Merkel, do not want next week\u2019s summit hijacked by Greece, notes The Guardian, but that appears inevitable without a breakthrough.\nJoshua Scigala, co-founder of Vaultoro, a firm that holds bitcoin for its customers and allows them to exchange it for gold and vice versa, told Reuters that Greeks are buying the currency as they lose their trust in the authorities. Over the past two months, Vaultoro has seen a 124 percent increase in business from Greeks.\nReuters notes that, though bitcoin's value has previously been highly volatile, it has stabilized over the past six months and is increasingly treated as a legitimate and potentially valuable asset by major financial institutions, and even by governments such as Britain's.\n\"You have people worrying about their families' wealth or their life savings, and worrying that their money might be locked up in banks,\u201d said Scigala. \u201cThey'd rather hold money in a private asset like gold or bitcoin. Some people aren't waiting for the government to figure out an exit plan and are doing it for themselves.\u201d\nIf the Greek situation isn\u2019t solved soon, more and more Greeks concerned about capital controls can be expected to take their money out of the country\u2019s banks and move it into bitcoin.\nReuters notes that a bitcoin-like digital currency, backed either by Greece's assets or future tax revenues, could conceivably be introduced as a parallel currency in Greece. Varoufakis wrote a blog post in February proposing a similar IOU-based currency, which he dubbed Future Tax Coin (FT-Coin). Though he is not impressed by bitcoin as a currency, Varoufakis is persuaded that its underlying blockchain technology could be put to effective use in troubled economies.\u00a0\nRecently, CNBC contributor Brian Kelly, the author of \u201cThe Bitcoin Big Bang: How Alternative Currencies Are About to Change the World,\u201d proposed a similar bitcoin-like solution for Greece\u2019s troubled economy.", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 18}

As recently noted by Bitcoin Magazine, such a possibility might have a significant impact on digital currencies.\n\u201cWe do consider [Grexit] as one of possible risks which would increase turbulence in the financial markets in the European market, bearing in mind the fact the European Union is one of major trading partners, and we are definitely worried by it,\u201d Nabiullina said. \u201cThere will be possible consequences. And there is a possibility of this kind of sentiment becoming stronger, which could reduce the rate of the development of the recovery of the European economy, and bring down the demand for our products.\u201d\nNabiullina declined to speculate on the likelihood of Grexit.In reply to a direct question, Nabiullina commented on the actions taken by the central bank to stabilize the Russian currency, such as rising interest rates, and finally, and win the battle against the speculators. \u201cIn order to stabilize [the currency], we had to apply a comprehensive set of measures \u2013 some of them being very unpopular, such as raising an interest rate,\u201d she said. \u201cThe situation in the market gradually is stabilizing. But at the same time we were facing, you know, huge objectives to reduce inflation. Our objective is to reduce it down to 4 percent.\u201d\u00a0\nPhoto Pavel Kazachkov\n\n", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 18}

The two agents, Shaun Bridges and Carl Force from the Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Secret Service, were charged with several offenses including wire fraud and money laundering.\nThis week, Bridges, a special agent for the U.S. Secret Service for the Silk Road case, has come to an agreement with the prosecutors and pleaded guilty for the theft of confiscated bitcoin from Silk Road.\nBridges took part in a Baltimore task force as a computer forensics expert where he contributed to an investigation which acquired enough evidence to accuse Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road for allegedly hiring assassins to murder six individuals that threatened the marketplace.\nDuring the operation, Bridges stole thousands in bitcoin by obtaining the passwords to Silk Road from the marketplace\u2019s customer support representative and moved the bitcoin to his own personal account.\nSpecifically, the prosecutors claimed that the stolen bitcoin were transferred into Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, to convert the bitcoin into U.S. dollars and then move it to his bank account.The bitcoin stolen by Bridges are said to be worth around $820,000, which is equivalent to around 3,565 bitcoin, at today\u2019s bitcoin price.\nBridges Pleads Guilty to Theft\nThis week, in a filing at the San Francisco federal court, Bridges agreed to plead guilty for the theft of bitcoin that once belonged to Silk Road and to two other charges: money laundering and obstruction of justice.\n\u201cMr. Bridges has regretted his actions from the very beginning,\" Bridges\u2019 lawyer, Steve Hale Levin said. \"His decision to plead guilty reflects his complete acceptance of responsibility and is another step towards rehabilitation.\u201d\nBack in March, however, Bridges and Levin strongly denied the accusations.\u201cMr. Bridges, a former law enforcement officer with an unblemished record, maintains his innocence.

The committee will help execute and discuss a payment strategy laid out by the Fed earlier this year.\nThe central bank\u2019s main goal is upgrading the country\u2019s domestic payment system used for e-check settlement, called the Automatic Clearing House (ACH). Developed in the 1970s, it takes 1-2 days for it to clear a payment, something that simply won\u2019t do anymore in our fast-paced world, according to the Fed.\nTo represent the interests of various stakeholders in the 300-plus-person task force, a steering committee has been elected by industry peers. Ripple Labs\u2019 Ryan Zagone, head of research on the Business Development team, has been elected to represent the technology and nonservice banking provider sector. He, alongside 15 other committee members, will lead discussions on how to bring real-time settlement to the U.S. payment system.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a privilege to be selected,\" Zagone said. \"I look forward to leveraging Ripple\u2019s global experience as the task force assess ways to increase speed, efficiency, access to, and competition in payments.\u201d\nOne of many\nRipple Labs first got involved with the Fed\u2019s payment initiative, at least to some degree, when it participated in the call for information by the central bank during 2013 and 2014, which helped shape the later published payment roadmap. And it appears the digital currency startup's ideas might have caught some attention. As one potential solution for faster payments listed in the January 2015 report read:\n\n[To] facilitate direct clearing between financial institutions on public IP networks using protocols and standards for sending and receiving payments.\u00a0A distributed architecture for messaging between financial institutions over public IP networks has the potential to lower costs compared to clearing transactions over a hub-and-spoke network architecture. A central authority would establish common protocols for messaging standards, communication, security and logging transactions.\nIt sounds a bit like Ripple\u2019s hybrid cryptocurrency payment system that leverages centralized institutions over a distributed network. And already, three of Australia's Big Four banks \u2014 Westpac, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia \u2014 announced that they have been, or will begin, testing Ripple for real-time settlements between their subsidiaries.\nRipple might be one option on the table, but the rest of the Steering Committee is also packed with heavy hitters in the U.S. payment industry. Dwolla is a prime example and has already gotten traction with their real-time payment system FiSync. The U.S. subsidiary of global banking giant, BBVA, announced in April that through FiSync their customers will be able to send free payments which clear instantly.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 18}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nA recent survey conducted by personal finance company Fair Go Finance has found that a large chunk of Australians are ready to leave the traditional banking system and move to digital money. The survey received responses from 3,148 people, and the questions involved everything from bitcoin to Facebook money transfers.\nThe online survey was conducted in April 2015.\n34% know about bitcoin\nThirty-four percent of Australians who responded to the survey claimed they know something about bitcoin. Of course, the level of understanding of bitcoin is likely to vary from person to person. The question was phrased as, \u201cDo you know anything about Bitcoins?\u201d which means many respondents who had simply heard of bitcoin as some sort of PayPal alternative would have likely responded in the affirmative. Some of these respondents may have trouble attempting to explain the complexities of the blockchain.\nThere was a bit of divergence in the responses from men and women in this initial question about bitcoin. While 43 percent of male respondents claimed to know about bitcoin, only 28 perecent of women did. There was less of a divergence in the responses from Generation X and Y. In fact, the numbers from those age groups were practically identical.\nAmong the Australian population, 51 percent of respondents claimed they do their digital money research on their own. Twenty-six percent said they get their information from friends and family, and 13 percent said they learn about digital money from their current bank or finance provider. Only 2 percent of respondents claimed they are not interested in digital money or financial technology.\nIt\u2019s all about convenience\nWhen it comes to the reasons behind Australia\u2019s thirst for digital money, convenience is king. Seventy percent of respondents claimed that convenience and the ability to use digital money 24/7 are the best features of the financial technology. Twelve percent of respondents find digital money to be safer than carrying cash, while 15 percent claimed it helps them be more in control of their finances. Two percent of respondents find digital money to be too risky.Although this survey was about more than bitcoin, it should be noted that the digital commodity still has plenty of work to do in the convenience department. Price volatility and an inability for the average person to understand the technology are still key barriers to mainstream adoption.\nAustralia\u2019s desire for convenience was also seen in a question related to how digital money is used in the real world. Forty-eight percent of respondents said they would like to replace PIN codes with biometrics by 2020. Only 18 percent claim they would not use biometrics, with the rest undecided.\n36% want digital money, but not from Facebook\nPerhaps the most interesting finding is that 36 percent of respondents claimed that they would change banks for better digital money services. Thirty-five percent claimed they would not change banks in order to access better financial technology, while 29 percent were unsure.\nAlthough Australians are ready to gain access to better digital money services, it appears that transferring money via Facebook is not in the cards for most. Sixty-nine percent of respondents say they would not use the social media platform to send money to family and friends, and only 11 percent seem ready to use Facebook for payments right now.", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 20}

More interesting, though, is the gradual adoption by more and more members of the British public.\nCEX is a chain of secondhand technology stores and a regular fixture on many British high streets. It is one of the more significant U.K. retailers that accepts payment in bitcoin; the nature of the retail outlets\u2019 focus on technology means it has access to a massive cross-section of the current and potential cryptocurrency user base. Early adopters such as CEX serve the wider Bitcoin community by providing greater visibility to the cryptocurrency and leading by example in its faith in the alternative currency.\nA significant difficulty remaining with U.K. Bitcoin adoption is existing financial authorities, namely the big British banks, who are ever reluctant to work with a Bitcoin-based enterprise. This means many Bitcoin businesses aimed at the British market are based elsewhere in Europe, resulting in U.K. customers facing two- or three-day delays when transferring fiat currencies to Bitcoin businesses as they must use SEPA transfers to European bank accounts.\nPerhaps the government interest in cryptocurrencies will lead to renewed faith within British banks toward Bitcoin, and eventually Bitcoin businesses will be able to do their fiat banking at home. This would be an important step toward enabling cryptocurrency-based enterprise to become a significant player in the future U.K. economy.\nThe map provided by wheretospendbitcoins.co.uk shows a reasonably consistent spattering of Bitcoin-friendly businesses across Great Britain, with a great deal centered on the capital. The profile of a business that accepts bitcoin payments is surprisingly diverse, with everyone from trendy foodie bars such as La Porca in Camden to Sushi cooking school YourSushi, which has sites in a number of British cities, getting involved in the cryptocurrency.\nOnly time will tell if Bitcoin can overcome the almost novel, speculative light in which many see it, but it is the visibility of the currency across public life that ultimately has the greatest power to influence greater use. Policymakers have a responsibility to ensure the public has the protection and right to access the incredible potential of cryptocurrencies.\nEntrepreneurialism is rife within the Bitcoin community and drives the currency forward; it is now possible to purchase almost any goods with bitcoin through the ingenuity of services such as giftoff.com which enables users to purchase a huge variety of gift cards for stores including Apple and Amazon using bitcoin and a range of alternative cryptocurrency.\nHopefully, development and adoption of Bitcoin will continue both within the U.K. and further afield across the rest of 2015, and perhaps 2016 will be the year that we can pay our rent and tax obligations using bitcoin, helping to push the international community to move toward accepting the legitimacy of the alternative currency.\nThere are still obstacles to overcome for Bitcoin, with headaches regarding the future of the block size causing issues for developers around the world working on the Bitcoin project; however, as always, it is an exceptionally exciting time to be involved with the cryptocurrency community.", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 20}

Although Sand Hill may have accomplished the construction of a functional derivatives market traded over the blockchain, the SEC was unimpressed, quickly shutting it down.\nThe story of an audacious startup skirting regulations viewed by some as overbearing, with the ensuing swift and severe regulatory response may be old news to businesses operating the virtual currency space, but Sand Hill\u2019s saga emphasizes two key points to remember for any business seeking to disrupt regulated financial markets.\n Change Must Occur Within the Confines of the Law\nThus, if the projected valuation of a share of pre-IPO \u201cBusiness X\u201d was $10 when Purchaser obtained a CFD of Business X on Sand Hill, and the valuation increased at the contract settlement date, Purchaser would have earned value that could be liquidated.\nTo skirt the considerable registration burden associated with trading (legal) equities, Sand Hill apparently conducted its transaction activity over the Bitcoin blockchain. CFDs, however, are illegal to sell over any trading medium in the United States. Sand Hill also confessed to having inserted trader \u201cbots\u201d that created the illusion of active trading volume to populate their marketplace. Of course, these bots could also be used to intentionally manipulate values of the instruments being traded.\nLess than a month after taking its platform live, Sand Hill reported that it was shut down and fined $20,000 for multiple violations of SEC regulations, including acting as unregistered broker-dealers, selling security-based swaps, and offering swaps on an unregistered securities exchange. Notably, Sand Hill stated in its blog that it had customer holdings only in the low thousands of dollars.\nCo-founder Elaine Ou\u2019s blog post about the SEC shutdown is eye-opening, and captures a zeitgeist common among virtual currency startups: We are hacking the system to make it better and nobody is getting hurt, so regulators, please leave us alone.\nHowever, as Bloomberg observed, \u201cJust because you mumble the word \u2018blockchain\u2019 doesn't make\u00a0otherwise illegal things legal.\u201d As Sand Hill, Ripple, and others are learning, regulators will enforce the law against violators regardless of their philosophical ideology, level of funding, or stated intention.\nBlockchain technology may inevitably reform the financial structures of many markets, but illegal, unregistered activity will always draw the attention of regulators. Innovation based upon blockchain technology may be the future, but that innovation can and should be conducted within the present confines of the law.\n Just Because You Can Does Not Mean You Should.\n the SEC was aggressively using Sand Hill\u2019s site, the number of SEC users using the site, information regarding the interests and surfing habits of the SEC users of the site, including the IP addresses, those users\u2019 other frequently visited sites, and the amount of time spent engaged with Sand Hill\u2019s service.\nSand Hill appears to have used legal means to track the SEC\u2019s investigative behavior. However, from a strategic standpoint, exposing this information publicly may not have been in Sand Hill\u2019s interest. The SEC has considerable regulatory power and can seek injunctions and levy significant fines.\nAlthough Sand Hill\u2019s technology and philosophy may be of interest to the virtual currency community, its behavior and the likely effect on its experience with regulators should be noted. Antagonizing regulators is a poor negotiating strategy, even if you are using legal means and public information to do so.No matter the perceived wrong, potential regulatory targets will always benefit from sound legal advice from counsel. Just because you can do it, does not mean you should do it.\u00a0\nPhoto by AgnosticPreacherskid / CC BY-SA 3.0\n", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 8}

But recently, the accelerator announced its next batch, \u201cTribe 6,\u201d will be split equally between bitcoin, virtual and augmented reality startups.\nBoost.VC founder and CEO Adam Draper told TechCrunch why they made the shift: \u201cWe\u2019re good at building communities around early tech sectors. We bring together investors, entrepreneurs and builders, and by focusing investments on a category over time, we ourselves become experts in the subject, and thus more valuable to startups that might want to join.\u201d\nBoost.VC has always been bitcoin-friendly, funding some of the first Bitcoin exchanges in the United States, BitBox and Coinbase, in 2013. But in early 2014, Draper shocked many when he said he was going to accelerate 100 Bitcoin startups by 2017. So far, Boost is making good on that promise with nearly 50 digital currency startups already in its portfolio.\nMany of the Bitcoin startups it has accelerated have gone to raise large rounds. Most recently, Mirror, formerly a Bitcoin exchange but now a marketplace for smart contracts, announced a $8.8 million funding round raised from Route 66 Ventures, Battery Ventures, Crosslink Capital, RRE Ventures and Tim Draper. Many other Boost startups have gone on to raise rounds in the hundreds of thousands or millions.\nTo early stage entrepreneurs Boost.VC offers mentorship, free living and office space in their Silicon Valley headquarters, access to their network of advisers and experts and $15,000-$25,000 in funding for 6 percent of a startup.\nDraper\u2019s interest in VR and AR comes from wanting to build out chasm industries (ones that will eventually turn into billion-dollar businesses but aren\u2019t there yet) and thinks VR is next, specifically consumer apps. Boost.VC will not be accepting any VR companies building hardware, noting that Sumsung, Google and others already have that covered. Instead, his company will focus on trying to build killer software apps for those devices.\nHe told TechCrunch that he specifically is excited about the potential for educational uses of VR. Google\u2019s Expeditions, which allows users to go on \u201cvirtual field trips,\u201d is an app that highlights the technology\u2019s potential in education, Draper said.\n\nImage via Boost.vc.", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 8}

The most exciting immediate application is for political polling as Augur would enable the largest consensus of models possible.\u201d\n\u201cHarnessing the blockchain, Augur has created the first online platform for a global market of predictions,\u201d states the Exponential Finance website. \u201cAnybody can create a market for an event, and anyone can wager whether that event will occur or not.\n\u201dPrediction markets harness the \u201cwisdom of the crowds\u201d to create powerful and uncensorable forecasting engines. \u201cThis is the future of forecasting,\u201d says the Exponential Finance announcement.\nPrediction markets are speculative markets created for the purpose of making predictions. The current market price for a prediction \u2013 for example the election of a particular candidate \u2013 can be interpreted as an aggregate, crowdsourced estimate of the probability of the prediction. For example, if a prediction market security rewards a dollar if a particular candidate is elected, those who think the candidate had a 70 percent chance of being elected should be willing to pay up to 70 cents for the security.\nEvidence suggests that such financial incentives make prediction markets more effective than other forecasting strategies. The Iowa Electronic Markets typically predicts elections within one percent, more accurate than polls or expert opinions. Since 1988 it has correctly predicted the outcome of every U.S. presidential election. The Foresight Exchange, one of the oldest active prediction markets, is a public, play-money market allowing individuals to sign up for free and predict the future.\nPrediction markets had a moment of fame in 2003, when the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a proposed futures exchange developed by the United States' Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), was canceled after a wave of accusations of incentivizing terrorism, which resulted in the resignation of John Poindexter, head of the DARPA unit responsible for developing the project.\n\"The idea of a federal betting parlor on atrocities and terrorism is ridiculous, and it's grotesque,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden.\nThe PAM was inspired by the work of George Mason University economist Robin Hanson, a leading researcher in the field, co-creator of the Foresight Exchange, and author of a seminal paper on \u201cIdea Futures,\u201d who is now one of the Augur advisors. Hanson explains his ideas on prediction markets and Augur in a short video posted on the Augur website.\nAccording to Hanson, real money markets such as the Iowa Electronic Markets \u2013 and Wall Street \u2013 predict election outcomes better than opinion polls. Referring to previous regulatory obstacles encountered by prediction markets such as PAM, Hanson notes that all of our familiar financial instruments: stocks, insurance, commodity futures, options were once forbidden by anti-gambling laws.", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 7}

All accounts, assets and company documents have been handed over to the Swiss justice ministry and are under investigation.\nIn an open letter released on the official website of Bitmine AG, the company\u2019s management claimed that Bitmine AG had tried to restructure its products and services by seeking new investments. It failed, however, to raise enough funding to continue its production of ASIC miners which led to the company\u2019s bankruptcy.\nBitmine AG initially engaged in a contract with Innosilicon, a Chinese chip manufacturer to develop their 28nm ASIC. The company provided the manufacturer with explicit instructions, process of creating the mask, wafers and IC packaging concurrent to the one-year exclusivity agreement on the chip. However, Bitmine AG said it discovered that Innosilicon had violated the contract and sold the A1 chips itself.\nMoreover, the shipment of the A1 chips was delayed for a few months, and the majority of the chips were defective plus we do not know what bitcoin mining software was used.\n\u201cInnosilicon repeatedly delivered us broken chips or 'junk grade' ones as part of the purchased (and paid for) lots, forcing us to place ever bigger and bigger orders in order to fulfill our customers\u2019 orders and eventually draining out most of the company\u2019s money,\" Bitmine said. \"Out of all the ordered chips, a huge part of them were simply not working and could only be thrown away in the garbage bin.\u201d\nBitmine also stated that the rapid increase of mining difficulty has been one of the core reasons why more than half of the customers canceled the orders.\u201cIf bitcoin was still valued at well over $1,000 like it was in the beginning of 2014, nobody would have tried to cancel his orders and we would all be rich,\" Bitmine AG said. \"Unfortunately, the BTC value collapsed constantly since Mt.Gox\u2019s bust, and mining difficulty exploded to values that nobody was able to predict at the time we were selling our products.\u201d\nLawsuits Filed Against Bitmine AG\nRegardless of the attempts of Bitmine AG to explain the company\u2019s status to their furious customers, the ASIC miner developer began to face multiple lawsuits claiming defrauding since April, 2015.\nSince its presale of a new product called CoinCraft Series 28nm, customers of Bitmine AG did not receive a single mining rig for at least 2-3 months. The refund requests were ignored by the company while Bitmine AG continued to launch new products.\nCurrently, the company is charged with multiple lawsuits and will face its customers in court this month.", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 7}

The Medici project was designed to create a decentralized stock exchange within the Counterparty platform.

T\u00d8.com means that trades made with the system clear in the same day instead of the standard Wall Street technology, which traders call T+3, which clears and settles trades in three days.\nBased on blockchain technology, T\u00d8.com technology increases the reliability and speed of trades. In addition to the speed, buyers of the cryptosecurity will be able to track asset ownership directly on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\n\u201cIssuing the TIGRcub bonds on the T\u00d8.com platform proves that cryptotechnology can facilitate transparent and secure access to capital by emerging companies,\u201d Byrne said.\nInformation about the cryptosecurity offering was distributed to investors on June 1. The offering is being made only to institutional buyers that meet the legal definition of an accredited investor by rule 506(c) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933.\nBy offering bonds while following regulations, Overstock.com is able to bring the world\u2019s first security based on blockchain to investors.

This will reduce the available total of the bonds to $24.5 million.\u00a0\n\"It's not exactly Jonas Salk injecting himself with his polio vaccine, but I wanted to own the first cryptosecurity ever issued,\" stated Byrne. \"I intend to demonstrate my belief not just in Overstock, but in the T\u00d8.com platform that we built and, indeed, in the cryptorevolution itself.\"\nThe purchase of the first ever Cryptobond marks a successful start to the Medici project and the expansion of blockchain technology into Wall Street-based trades.\nThis post \u00a0was updated with information about the first bond purchase at 3:44 EDT on June 8, 2015.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 8}

In November, Blockstream closed a $21 million seed funding round with nearly 40 high-profile investors.\nThe Bitcoin Sidechains paper envisages an ecosystem of \u201csidechains\u201d separate from the main Bitcoin blockchain but interoperable with it by means of two-way pegs, allowing for the transfer of assets between sidechains and the main blockchain. A sidechain can implement changes from Bitcoin Core, for example, more powerful scripting features or more watertight privacy. According to Blockstream, sidechains enable innovators to safely develop new applications without jeopardizing Bitcoin\u2019s core code and putting billions of dollars worth of digital currency at risk.\nFor a readable explanation of sidechains, see \u201cA simple explanation of Bitcoin \u2018Sidechains,\u201d by Richard Gendal Brown, executive architect for banking innovation at IBM UK. Despite the considerable interest in sidechains, the enthusiasm of developers has been so far dampened by the lack of actual implementations of sidechains.\nNow Blockstream has announced Sidechain Elements, a sidechain development framework with open source code and developer sidechains.\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to announce the release of Sidechain Elements,\u201d says Adam Back, co-founder and president of Blockstream. \u201cSidechains extend Bitcoin functionality through interoperable blockchain networks and today\u2019s open source release includes an experimental sidechain that has a number of new working capabilities. With the release of Sidechain Elements, Blockstream is moving this effort into the community.\u201d\nSidechain Elements includes functioning code and a testing environment for working with sidechains with several components: the core network software to build an initial testing sidechain, eight new features not currently supported by Bitcoin, a basic wallet and the code for moving coins between blockchains.Blockstream's CTO and Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell explains Sidechain Elements in a video on the Blockstream website.\nAs open-source, protocol-level technology, developers can use Sidechain Elements to extend the functionality of Bitcoin and explore new applications of the Blockchain. \"Although both are ultimately needed, sidechains are true innovation and value add in contrast to merely increasing the block size and kicking a larger can,\" said early Bitcoin investor Trace Mayer.\n\u201cWe\u2019re inviting developers to work with us, to test and use the code for their projects, and to share their proposals and code for additional capabilities,\u201d says Back. The new features not currently supported by Bitcoin Core include Confidential Transactions, Basic Asset Issuance, Relative Lock Time and several others.\nOne of the most powerful new features being explored in Elements is Confidential Transactions, a cryptographic tool to improve the privacy and security of Bitcoin. This feature keeps the amounts transferred visible only to participants in the transaction (and those they designate). A detailed explanation of Confidential Transactions by Maxwell is available here.\nWith Basic Asset Issuance, users can issue their own assets via newly created units that represent fungible ownership of an underlying asset type. These tokens can theoretically represent any asset including vouchers, coupons, currencies, deposits, bonds, shares, etc.\nWith Relative Lock Time, the consensus-enforced semantics of the sequence number field is modified to enable a signed transaction input to remain invalid for a defined period of time after confirmation of its corresponding output, for the purpose of supporting consensus-enforced transaction replacement features. This feature is also useful for efficient implementation of blockchain secured off-chain layers like the Lightning Network, where related transactions can take place instantly on \u201cmicropayment channels\u201d off-chain, and only the final settlement is processed by the blockchain.\nBlockstream will seek to provide Sidechain Elements as a base for the nearly 30 blockchain innovation initiatives that have been announced by major financial institutions in the past few months. Since the deployment of sidechains interoperable with Bitcoin requires the implementation of suitable tweaks to Bitcoin Core, Blockstream is working to draft a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal for a fully decentralized two-way peg and merge-mined sidechains.\nOnce fully implemented, sidechains will probably have a disruptive impact on the Bitcoin ecosystem.

For new bitcoiners, Tel Aviv is like a dream come true; it has everything you need to get started with the digital currency.For starters, the Israeli Facebook Group \u201cIsraeli Bitcoin\u201d has more than 4,500 members. The group is extremely active and friendly to newcomers.Also, for those who wish to hear an active stream of lectures about the Bitcoin ecosystem there is the Israeli Bitcoin Meetup Group. The group gets together roughly twice a month inside the Google Campus on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. The group has more than 1,800 members, and on average you can find 30-50 people in each meetup.But Tel Aviv is not all about lectures and theory; it\u2019s a city that also puts Bitcoin into practice. The Bitcoin Embassy is a place where Bitcoin entrepreneurs get together to work on Bitcoin-related projects. It\u2019s located in the heart of Tel Aviv\u2019s financial district, amid major banking institution headquarters and across the street from the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. It is also a place the community can use to organize different Bitcoin-related events.\n\u201cThe Embassy, as we call it, is the home of a large community of people from all walks of life, hosting lectures, courses, tutorials, and even the GBA meetings. It provides an open office setting that anyone can use along with a fully stocked fridge and coffee machine. Many consider the Embassy as the Parthenon of Bitcoin.\u201d- Eli Sklar, Bitcoin Ambassador\nFor us, bitcoin isn\u2019t just bitcoin - all open trade technologies are within our scope ...

Now, Symbiont has announced that it has secured $1.25 million of seed funding from influential financial market leaders including Duncan Niederauer, former CEO of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). A \u2018Series A\u2019 round of institutional investment is expected to close in the third quarter of 2015.\n\u201cSymbiont is bridging the gap between Wall Street and the emerging blockchain ecosystem,\u201d said Niederauer. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting, timely and much-needed development for the long-term health of the markets.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to leverage this previously unimaginable technology for the greater good of investors, financial institutions, and global financial markets,\u201d said Smith, co-founder and CEO of Symbiont. \u201cThe blockchain not only has the potential to democratize markets but to drive down the cost of doing business across all sectors.\u201d\nThe Financial Times notes that the investment reflects growing interest by professional traders and infrastructure providers in the use of blockchain technology for global financial markets. Symbiont is developing a platform that allows market participants to create digital, programmable versions of securities. The company hopes the development of these securities, and their availability in one global, decentralized peer-to-peer network, will increase efficiency and transparency and lower the cost of issuing, trading, settling and clearing securities.\nReuters reports that Smith emphasized that the company does not run an exchange. \n\u201cOur focus is not trading digital currencies,\u201d said Smith. \u201cOur focus is the application of the blockchain or distributed ledger technology in conjunction with smart contracts for the issuance, management, trading, clearing, and settlement of different traditional financial securities.\u201d\nSymbiont isn\u2019t the only company trying to revolutionize the stock markets with the blockchain technology. Nasdaq, a prestigious stock exchange and leading financial institution, recently announced that it will leverage blockchain technology as part of an enterprise-wide initiative, starting with a pilot project in Nasdaq Private Market, a recently launched marketplace that handles pre-IPO trading among private companies.\n\u201cUtilizing the blockchain is a natural digital evolution for managing physical securities,\u201d said Nasdaq CEO Bob Greifeld. \u201cOur initial application of Nasdaq\u2019s blockchain technology-enabled offering will modernize, streamline and secure typically cumbersome administrative functions, and will simplify the overwhelming challenges private companies face with manual ledger record-keeping.\u201d\nOverstock is developing a new independent stock exchange dubbed Medici, powered by blockchain technology. The new stock exchange could sidestep traditional stock exchanges such as NYSE and Nasdaq and issue corporate stock directly over the Internet. \n\u201cThe cryptorevolution has arrived on Wall Street,\u201d said Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne. \u201cWe\u2019re making it official by offering the world\u2019s first \u2018cryptosecurity.\u2019\u201d\nIn 2014, Counterparty\u2019s technology was selected as the main software backbone for Medici. It was later revealed that Medici will include a wider variety of Bitcoin technologies, protocols and blockchains, but now it appears that Counterparty\u2019s technology will play an important role in the emergent cryptosecurities sector via Symbiont. \n\u201cAfter studying the intricacies of [the blockchain] it became clear that blockchains in general, and Counterparty specifically, could solve longstanding, previously intractable problems that exist in modern financial markets,\u201d Smith said in March. \u201cThis epiphany made the decision to join forces with the Counterparty team a logical one.\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 10}

(BTCS) and Spondoolies-Tech Move Forward with Merger", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-shop-inc-btcs-spondoolies-tech-move-forward-merger-1433969361/", "birthday": "Jun 10, 2015  4:49 PM EST", "date": "2015-06-10 21:49:00", "content": " CryptoBrief.com\nIn an attempt to create one of the world\u2019s first publicly traded bitcoin transaction verification companies, Bitcoin Shop, Inc. (BTCS) and Spondoolies-Tech, Ltd. have announced that they are in the process of merging.\nBy merging, BTCS, which recently launched its own mining farm, would gain access to the technology of one of the top hardware providers in the ecosystem.\nThe deal is an all-stock deal that will result in BTCS owning 53 percent of the combined company. This is due to the recent $1.5 million investment in Spondoolies that took place in May, which was a first step in completing the merger. This initial investment by BTCS bought it 6.6 percent equity interest in Spondoolies based on a pre-money valuation of $21.2 million.\nWhen the merger is complete, Charles Allen, the CEO of BTCS, will act as the CEO and chairman of the merged company. Guy Corem, Spondoolies CEO and co-founder, will serve as a board member and executive officer. Yuval Rozen will be BTCS\u2019s CFO.\nCombined BTCS Moving Forward\n\u201cWith the completion of BTCS\u2019s recent investment in Spondoolies, we will begin turn our attention to moving the merger process forward,\u201d Charles Allen said in an interview with\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine.\nAnd the future of BTCS and Spondoolies post-merger proves to disrupt the mining world.\n\u201cThe core focus post-merger will be to design, manufacture and deploy servers in BTCS\u2019s data center and expand to other low-cost data centers operated by the company,\u201d Allen explained. \u201cWe are still discussing the possibility of selling equipment to certain customers. However, the decision will be based on what is in the best interest of our shareholders.\u201d\nSpondoolies launched just a year ago, but it took the mining world by shock with its high-quality chips. The implication would be that BTCS, a bitcoin miner, would also be producing chips to give itself a competitive advantage over other miners rather than being a supplier to other miners.\n\u201cDuring our first year of operation, Spondoolies successfully launched five different hardware products which are widely recognized as the best of their respective categories,\u201d said Guy Corem, CEO of Spondoolies, in a statement. And the numbers support his statements. According to numbers released by Spondoolies \u2014 and audited by Deloitte for the planned merger \u2014 the company had $28 million in revenue in 2014.\nAnd according to the numbers, that growth seems to be getting even stronger despite where the price of bitcoin has been going for the past year.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve shipped out more units in December 2014 than we have in April of the same year, which is a strong indicator of our ongoing growth,\u201d Kobi Levin, COO of Spondoolies, said in a statement.\nBTCS Farm Well Above Break Even Price\u00a0\nBased on the numbers provided by BTCS, the company still has more room for the price to drop before it reaches its real cost for mining. According to Allen, while the company hasn\u2019t disclosed its exact mining costs because it changes based on the network hashrate, the current hashrate has BTCS\u2019s cost resting between $100-$200/BTC.\nAt present, the company has 980 TH/s of hashing power that came online toward the end of the first quarter. By merging with Spondoolies, the company looks to ramp up even more hashing power.\nBut some argue that all of these large operations participating in mining is not the original intent of Bitcoin. Allen addressed that issue in an earlier interview, explaining that the mistake many earlier miners made was that they didn\u2019t takecost structure into consideration.\n\u201cA miner running a unit where electricity is expensive will have a much higher cost than a miner running an identical unit in an area with low-cost electricity. This has led to the current consolidation trend in mining into large facilities and away from private or home miners,\u201d he said.\nFuture Spondoolies Chips\u00a0\nWhile the combined company doesn\u2019t intend on focusing too much on developing products for the general population, that hasn\u2019t stopped it from coming up with new chips to launch this summer.\n\u201cSpondoolies-Tech is hard at work developing a third-generation ASIC,\u201d Guy Corem said in an interview with\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0\u201cThe new ASIC is aiming for a 4X improvement over the efficiency of the second-generation unit. The new ASIC will allow the merged company to secure a significant percentage of the hash rate.\u201d\nAccording to a\u00a0statement by the company, this next-generation chip should allow for bitcoin to be mined profitably, even if the bitcoin price\u00a0was to drop below $100.\nReleasing\u00a0this third-generation chip should definitely allow BTCS the potential to gain a large chunk of market share in the bitcoin mining space, increasing the likelihood that the merger does take place. However, if the merger does break down, BTCS will walk away with a $1 million breakup fee.\n\u00a0\nPhoto\u00a0Bob Mical\u00a0/ CC BY 2.0", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 10}

According to their press release, GoCoin and Ziftr are already equipped with the team and technology needed to \u201cswiftly surpass\u201d well established bitcoin payment processors and financial institutions.\nWith the existing payment gateways and the mobile wallet of GoCoin, Ziftr plans to aggressively challenge its competitor, Stripe, through the development of \u201ca hybrid traditional and digital currency payments powerhouse with a built-in customer loyalty program.\nGoCoin CEO Steve Beauregard announced, \"When consumers ask 'what's in it for me?', Bitcoin has a serious adoption problem. Loyalty points play a key role in a consumer's choice of payment method, and with the ziftrCOIN loyalty platform integrated into the ziftrWALLET, I believe we can finally give consumers the right experience to choose digital currencies over cards at checkout.\"\nGoCoin is currently the world\u2019s third largest blockchain payment processor, just behind Bitpay and Coinbase. With a diversified portfolio of clients which includes top mining companies such as Bitfury, Zoomhash, Hashpros and KnCminer and global brands including Shopify, CheapAir and Paypal, GoCoin plans to develop a platform efficient for many industries with the help of Ziftr. As of now, the company hopes to attract key players in the entertainment industry, specifically film producers and distributers.\n\"Ziftr has many of the necessary assets to accelerate mainstream adoption of digital currency, so merging with GoCoin and gaining access to its rapidly growing network of merchants gives our combined altcoin-friendly company the power to truly disrupt the $20 trillion global payments market,\" Bob Wilkins, CEO of Ziftr commented. \"Our platform will allow merchants of all sizes to benefit from the transparency and efficiency of blockchain payments by giving them a better solution than what's currently available.\u201d\nAs Wilkins explained, GoCoin\u2019s network of merchants grew rapidly in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2014, it was responsible for 37 percent of all new merchants accepting digital currency including dogecoin, litecoin and bitcoin.\nWhile the plans for the unified platform of GoCoin and Ziftr have not been released just yet, the large user base and rapidly growing networks for both companies could\u00a0be a key factor for the merger to bring the services and platforms of these two companies to a\u00a0new level given the synergies.", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 11}

It can be seen as a distributed, decentralized version of eBay powered by P2P technologies such as BitTorrent and Bitcoin.\n\u201cOpenBazaar is a different approach to online commerce,\u201d states the OpenBazaar website. \u201cIt puts the power back in the users\u2019 hands. Instead of buyers and sellers going through a centralized service, OpenBazaar connects them directly. Because there is no one in the middle of the transactions, there are no fees, no one can censor transactions, and you only reveal the personal information that you choose.\u201d\nDecentralization \u2013 the absence of a central server that can be attacked, shut down or seized by hostile agents \u2013 is an important feature of OpenBazaar. While Napster, a pre-BitTorrent file-sharing Internet service popular between 1999 and 2002, had its servers seized by the authorities and shut down, the decentralized BitTorrent technology proved much more resilient because it didn\u2019t rely on central servers. Similarly, the history of Silk Road shows that online marketplaces can become resilient only by abandoning central servers in favor of decentralized protocols.\nAnother stated goal of the OpenBazaar team and its new investors is to build the first business on top of the OpenBazaar network. The business, dubbed OB1, will offer services to OpenBazaar users, and aims to bootstrap adoption of decentralized commerce by offering services such as dispute resolution, store hosting, and more. The OpenBazaar protocol and client will continue to be open source, MIT licensed, distributed and free.\n\u201cOpenBazaar is intriguing,\u201d notes The Wall Street Journal. \u201cIt\u2019s using two key technologies, file-sharing software and bitcoin, to produce a sort of decentralized eBay, where buyers and sellers will interact directly and private data will be kept private. The platform works using BitTorrent file-sharing software and bitcoin to create a decentralized network of buyers and sellers. There is no middle-man, and no user fees. It is completely open.\u201d\nAmir Taaki and other developers created the first OpenBazaar prototype, known as DarkMarket, in April 2014 at a Toronto Bitcoin Hackathon, as a proof of concept in response to the seizure of Silk Road in October 2013. Taaki compared DarkMarket\u2019s improvements on Silk Road to BitTorrent\u2019s improvements on Napster. Indeed, BitTorrent, the father of modern approaches to a decentralized Internet, proved to be a fast and fully operational replacement for Napster without the critical weakness of depending on a central server.\nSoon after DarkMarket was revealed at the Hackathon, developer Brian Hoffman forked the project and renamed it OpenBazaar. While the project is aimed at decentralizing general-purpose marketplaces like eBay, it seems likely that it will be used for illegal operations as well, which the decentralized nature of the platform will make very hard to shut down.\nBut OpenBazaar itself is just software, it\u2019s \u201cagnostic,\u201d Hoffman says. The users themselves will determine what gets sold there.\u201cIt\u2019s what comes with the territory,\" Hoffman said. \"Bitcoin has the same problem.\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 11}

The creation of the lab came after the publishing of an extensive report about the benefits of the blockchain by the international bank.When the report was published, UBS Group CIO Oliver Bussmann told the Wall Street Journal, \u201cI believe \u2013 and this is my personal view \u2013 that blockchain technology will not only change the way we do payments, but it will change the whole trading and settlement topic.\u201d\nSince then, that hypothesis has begun to get some traction as the Nasdaq OMX Group began experimenting with a pilot of blockchain technology as a record-keeping ledger for the Nasdaq Private Market, a small market launched in 2014 to handle the trading of shares belonging to private companies.Smart-bonds likely is just one of several technological applications of blockchains UBS\u2019 lab is exploring. The lab, which is located in the London offices of European fintech startup accelerator Level39, is meant to spur new innovations that can bolster the bank\u2019s long-term growth\n.\u201cBlockchain technologies can make banks more efficient \u2013 for example, through instantaneous settlement rather than the days it takes at present, lower costs and lower operational risk,\u201d said Batlin during the IDX Derivatives Expo in London. \u201cThe simple lesson for banks is that if we don\u2019t do it someone else will.\u201d\nDifficulties remain\nBitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work mining algorithm is responsible for the digital currency\u2019s unique characteristics of network security and decentralization, but as Batlin pointed out, it is also causes the system to be slow and expensive. Transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain often take a hour or move and require large amounts of electricity via miners who verify transactions. These hurdles eliminate the possibility of high-frequency or algorithmic trading, as least as it currently stands.\n\u201cAll kinds of revenue opportunities can emerge,\u201d said Batlin speaking of how these innovations could be monetized, \u201cbut it\u2019s still more expensive, so there is a way to go.\u201d\u00a0\u201c\nUBS sign\u201d by twicepix /\u00a0CC BY-SA 2.0\u00a0\n\u00a0", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 12}

The project, which received \u20ac1.9 million funding from the European Union under FP7, wants to create a decentralized social networking platform for large-scale collaboration and decision-making.\nThe project team includes companies, universities and high-profile organizations such as the European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM), the French CNRS, and NESTA, a U.K. charity dedicated to foster socially relevant innovation with activities ranging from early stage investment to in-depth research and practical programs.\nD-CENT announced that it will design structurally sustainable money systems via the creation of a digital ecosystem of blockchain-enabled complementary currencies to use in parallel with conventional ones. This \u201cMonetary Ecology\u201d will advance development in two domains of social innovation: complementary currencies governance systems and decentralized trust management systems.\nThe project will include Digital Social Currency pilot projects in communities that are already actively designing tools for collective decision-making in local economies:\n - Social Kronas, a blockchain-enabled municipal currency and reward system for political participation in Reykjavik (Iceland); - The evolution and decentralization of Eurocat, a complementary currency launched in Barcelona (Spain) in 2014; - A decentralized social remuneration system that can reward the contributions that members of the Helsinki Urban-Cooperative Farm (Finland) perform to the common interest of the cooperative. This model will be also piloted at a cultural center in Milan (Italy).\nSee the D-CENT document \u201cDesign of Social Digital Currency\u201d for an overview of the Digital Social Currency pilot projects.\n\n\u201cThe Digital Social Currency pilot projects will experiment and test a new notion of proof-of-work: the Social Proof-of-Work, which is roughly the proof that a member in the system is endowed with coins as a reward to an action in the real world while abiding to community rules and enhancing collective values,\u201d states the NESTA website. \u201cBy linking democratic deliberation with currency creation through the Social Proof-of-Work, systems can be designed to enable a flexible currency supply set in real time at the light of users trust management dynamics. The basic tenet is to consider social currency as reputation management that can inform the money supply of a complementary currency in terms of tolerance to credit risk.\u201d\n\nAccording to the project team, most cryptocurrency design approaches tend to privilege the role of software and marginalize human contribution. D-CENT, instead, puts humans back at the center of the currency creation stage.\nThe project seems related to the concept of blockchain-enabled Local Exchange Trade System (LETS). A LETS establishes a complementary currency for local exchanges where offers, requests and IOUs are logged in a public accounting system visible to all members. In case of a default, the loss is absorbed equally by all members of a LETS, which makes it a mutual credit exchange.\nD-CENT is also related to recent proposals of Greece\u2019s Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, who wrote a blog post in February proposing a similar IOU-based currency, which he dubbed Future Tax Coin (FT-Coin).

The transfer of bitcoin doesn\u2019t constitute delivery of goods or services, and therefore it\u2019s not subject to VAT.\n\u201cThis is the most reasonable way to classify bitcoins in the context of VAT, and we are fortunate that the tax administration agrees with our view,\u201d says Luzius Meisser, president of Bitcoin Association Switzerland. \u201cBitcoin is a currency, and thus should also be treated like a currency.\u201d\nIn February 2014, a group of three Swiss Bitcoin organizations jointly wrote a formal inquiry to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration to clarify the legal situation of bitcoin with regards to VAT. The tax authority replied that bitcoin is to be treated just like any other payment option \u2013 trading bitcoin for Swiss francs is seen as similar to trading euros for Swiss francs. Furthermore, the transaction fees charged by bitcoin exchanges are VAT-free.\n\u201cThis is excellent news for bitcoin in Switzerland as it provides the legal certainty we need to professionally operate our business,\u201d says Niklas Nikolajsen, CEO of Swiss bitcoin exchange and service provider Bitcoin Suisse AG.\nOther European nations have made similar decisions. Recently, the Spanish tax office confirmed that, under Spanish law, bitcoin has been recognized as a financial service, and therefore the cryptocurrency isn\u2019t subject to the nation's 21 percent VAT.\nIn the European Union, which Switzerland is not part of, there is not yet clarity on the VAT status of bitcoin. In June, however, the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg is expected to hold a hearing on the matter, Handelszeitung reports.\n\u201cWe hope that the Swiss decision can serve as an inspiration for Europe,\u201d said Mathieu Buffenoir, vice-president of Bitcoin Association Switzerland.Bitcoin is now confirmed to be exempt from VAT in Switzerland, but other regulations apply. Switzerland considers digital currencies such as bitcoin equivalent to any other foreign currency. This means that the professional operation of bitcoin trading platforms constitutes financial intermediation with the requirement to comply with both the Banking Act and the Anti Money Laundering (AML) Act. Recently ECUREX, a digital finance marketplace for professional traders and financial institutions headquartered in Zurich, announced that it has become the first digital currency exchange platform to be fully compliant with both.\nSwitzerland, a modern country in the middle in Europe with a world-class financial system, a stable regulatory environment, and a thriving economy unencumbered by the often lengthy and ineffectual bureaucratic procedures of the European Union, is emerging as a good location for bitcoin businesses.\nIn related news reported by Handelszeitung, preparations are under way for the establishment of the first bitcoin bank in Switzerland, according to multiple sources in the financial sector. The bitcoin bank would be set up as a normal commercial bank connected to the banking network and compliant with the Banking and AML Acts, and able to offer all standard banking services.

That said, one digital currency company has already received a license from NYDFS and a number of others have stated they intend to seek BitLicenses shortly.\u201d\nAlthough ShapeShift.io is a Switzerland-based exchange, it has cut off service to it\u2019s New York State customers who are redirected to its website PleaseProtectConsumers.org, with an explanation of why they are leaving New York and how bitcoin and blockchain technology can prevent fraud and identity theft.\nThe website calls on other digital currency companies to suspend service to their New York state customers and redirect its website to the PleaseProtectConsumers page.\nVoorhees' company ShapeShift.io, which provides exchange services without asking customers for identifying information, recently launched the first digital currency exchange app for iOS.\nLots of unhappy campers in the Bitcoin community\nIn the week since the final BitLicense regulations were released digital currency companies and organizations have been weighing in, and it hasn\u2019t been a pretty sight.\nThere weren\u2019t enough changes between the second and final drafts to satisfy most of the original criticisms \u2013 that changes in the company\u2019s products will be held up by a lengthy approval process, that smaller startups won\u2019t have the cash to apply and that customers' private information should not end up in the hands of government bureaucrats.In addition, several company executives noted that there should have been an exemption for multi-sig products in the final draft noting that these don\u2019t involve the company having full custody of customers\u2019 bitcoin.\nOrganizations such as\u00a0Coin Center\u00a0are concerned that other states will follow suit and use the BitLicense program as a template. The nonprofit advocacy group Coin Center has launched a tracker that compares government policies about digital currencies between states.\u00a0\nThe glass is half full\nHowever, there was some recognition among bitcoiners such as Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire that the BitLicense program actually gives added credibility to digital currencies among the public and brings it inside the circle that includes governments.\nCameron and Tyler Winklevoss have been supportive of the BitLicense program and are waiting for their license to launch their NY Gemini exchange, saying \u201cwe feel like it's weeks \u2026\u201dWriting at Nasdaq.com, Martin Tillier says: \u201cSome of the regulations are sensible and, by increasing public confidence in the currency, could give the growing industry a serious boost\u2026 There is no reason that Bitcoin-related businesses should be exempt from requirements that apply to other financial concerns, although it should be noted that they don\u2019t stop criminal behavior. Bernie Madoff, et al, have proved that over the years. What they do, however, is increase consumer confidence, an important development if Bitcoin is to gain widespread acceptance.\u201d\nAs NYDFS\u2019s Matt Anderson notes: \u201cUltimately, we believe that prudent regulation will be important to building greater consumer confidence in digital currency and sparking wider adoption.\"\nJob creation by government\nMeanwhile, enterprise compliance company\u00a0Identity Mind\u00a0is selling its services to company compliance officers and administrators offering assistance in complying with BitLicense rules.\nAnd, not to miss an opportunity, the New Jersey legislature sees a chance to lure disaffected digital currency business from New York State by offering tax breaks to these companies.", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 12}

Otherwise, it will become a sort of underground thing that is useful for only those people savvy or intent enough to use it\u2026\u201d\nRecognizing the inevitability of some form of government regulation, Ito said, \u201cI think the key is that the regulators shouldn't be running the show and should take a supporting stance. If you look at ICAAN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), for example, there is a 'Government Advisory Committee' as one of the groups that advise the board, but the board is independent and the government doesn't control ICANN \u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat would be bad is if each state and government came up with lots of regulations that contradicted each other or were slightly different so that every Bitcoin company or idea had to get permission in each state and country and had to be slightly different in each region.\u201d\nRecently, MIT Digital Currency Initiative lead Brian Forde issued detailed criticisms of the proposed BitLicense program and urged regulators to take a more balanced approach, protecting both consumers and digital currencies innovators.\u00a0\nMIT Media Lab hosts an open forum to debate increasing the blocksize\nAlthough asked about his personal view on increasing the blocksize for Bitcoin, Ito says the most important thing for him is that the community of developers, entrepreneurs, miners and users openly debate and collaborate on this issue until a consensus is reached.\nTo assist with this process, the Media Lab has set up an online open public forum to debate whether an increase in blocksize to increase the number of Bitcoin transactions per second, is a needed step forward.Ito says the Media Lab is \u201chappy to support the community in this way\u201d and hopes that the current discussions can serve as a model for resolving future issues.\nIs bitcoin the first or the last digital currency?\nAbout bitcoin, Ito says: \u201cIt probably took me more time than I would like to admit for me to 'come around.' Also, I've come around to feeling it's super-important, but as Reid Hoffman likes to say, I'm still not sure if bitcoin is the first or the last digital currency. In other words, whether bitcoin itself evolves to be the final winner or whether something else inspired by bitcoin eventually takes off is still a question, I think.\u201d\nLightning Network\nOn Lightning: \u201cIt\u2019s a great idea. I\u2019ve been thinking of bitcoin as a layer on the Internet stack, like TCP/IP. Protocols like lightning are like HTTP, making it easier and more accessible for the world. \u2026 the key is balancing the needs of people in a huge variety of environments.\u201d\nZeroCash\nOn ZeroCash: \u201cI\u2019m excited about the potential for technology like ZeroCash to revolutionize this space. The tricky part of any global protocol or network is that anything we do in one country ripples across the world and has unintended consequences.\u201d\nHolograms\nOn holography: \u201cThe Object-Based Media group at the Lab is working on holography, and their various projects are on their group site. There\u2019s a hologram of me that is still a surprise when I come around the corner and end up face-to-face with it.\u201d\u00a0Joi Ito was an early pioneer in the development of the Internet, helping start the first commercial Internet service provider in Japan.\u00a0\nA former CEO of Creative Commons, Ito also has been an investor in a number of startups, including Twitter, Flickr, Kickstarter, littleBits and Formlabs, and has served on the boards of the Open Source Initiative, ICANN, The Mozilla Foundation, Public Knowledge and the Electronic Privacy Information Center.Ito believes that MIT can provide a neutral and respected academic home for the development of blockchain standards, technologies and best practices, independent of the powerful commercial and regulatory interests that are forming around the emerging digital economy.", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 2}

The government of Alexis Tsipras and his euro-skeptic, anti-establishment party Syriza, is trying to negotiate solutions for the struggling economy of Greece that would keep the country in the E.U. and the Eurozone, but the worst-case solution \u2013 Grexit \u2013 continues to be seen as a perhaps inevitable alternative option.\nGreece\u2019s Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis wrote a blog post in February proposing a similar IOU-based currency, which he dubbed Future Tax Coin (FT-Coin). Varoufakis is not impressed by bitcoin as a currency, but he is persuaded that its underlying technology could be put to effective use in troubled economies.\n\u201c[T]he technology of Bitcoin, if suitably adapted, can be employed profitably in the Eurozone as a weapon against deflation and a means of providing much-needed leeway to fiscally stressed Eurozone member-states,\u201d said Varoufakis. His post explained in detail how Greece could create an FT-Coin payment system with a Bitcoin-like algorithm to make it transparent, efficient and transactions-cost-free.\nRecently, CNBC contributor Brian Kelly, the author of \u201cThe Bitcoin Big Bang: How Alternative Currencies Are About to Change the World,\u201d proposed a similar bitcoin-like solution for Greece\u2019s troubled economy. Kelly notes that Greece could stay in the Eurozone and begin repaying its debt, but for that it needs a method to monetize state-owned assets while still maintaining ownership. Kelly is persuaded that a digital currency based on blockchain technology could provide the solution.\nNow, one of the most prestigious financial news sites analyzes whether the creation of an alternative currency could help toward a solution of Greece\u2019s financial problems. \u201cCould a Parallel Currency Help Save Greece From Drowning?\u201d asks Peter Coy on Bloomberg Business. Coy reports that even German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has said that Greece may need a parallel currency if talks with creditors fail, according to sources familiar with Schaeuble\u2019s views.\n\u201cOne version of the idea calls the second currency a TAN, for tax anticipation note. Another calls it a grec, for government reimbursement exchange credit. There's also the TCC, for tax credit certificate,\u201d notes Coy, and adds a mention of Varoufakis\u2019s proposal on the FT-coin, \u201cwhere FT stands for future taxes and coin refers to bitcoin.\u201d\nThe common idea is to free up Euros to pay foreign debts and to juice economic growth by spreading more money around domestically. The money would be an IOU issued by\u00a0the Greek government that could be passed from one person to another.\n\u201cThe government\u00a0could print a bunch of the new currency (or create electronic ledger entries if the currency is\u00a0virtual) and spend it on whatever governments buy, including civil servants' salaries,\u201d says Coy. \u201cPeople would in theory\u00a0be willing to accept the\u00a0money\u00a0because it\u00a0could be used to pay taxes.\u00a0\u201cThe Bloomberg article outlines contrasting reactions of notable economists, ranging from enthusiastic to strongly skeptical. Especially interesting is the observation of Robert Parenteau, owner of\u00a0investment and economic consultancy MacroStrategy Edge, who has written about the\u00a0TAN as an electronic parallel currency and advised the Greek government in collaboration with economist Jamie Galbraith, who has worked closely with Varoufakis.\n\"Maybe the idea will\u00a0take root in Spain or Italy,\u201d said Parenteau.\u00a0\nPhoto epSos. de\n\n\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/epsos/8474532085/in/photolist-dUSc9a-dSZe91-mccMon-58Q1cZ-9PSLHY-jsUeA9-9jWpt-6zbaEG-gvcsRz-qLYojk-8rfCL3-jPKep-a8aMKH-dPcqJ1-9XzDSk-qEuHxF-nSyyu-LFKPG-e2VMps-67rRe3-pGn2rq-5Pn3Vw-89ooYu-7vXQpv-8vEXcj-7gbjNH-8vEXkh-zEkF-89kbQz-8vEXtU-8vBVXt-8vBVYM-8vBWcM-55FLSR-8vBWgB-8uVTTM-8vBVJ2-8vBW8X-8vBWdB-rUzoPF-8vBVZr-8vBW4Z-8vBWhi-8vBVL8-2coVj-8vBWbc-8vEXJ9-8vEXd9-8vEXGf-8vEXvJ\n / CC BY 2.0\n", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 2}

Now, at the annual Google I/O event on May 28 and 29, Google officially announced its upcoming payment platform and revealed more details.Android Pay isn\u2019t a separate payment app, but an open platform that enables developers to integrate mobile payments into their apps. In fact, Android Pay is built right into the core Android operating system. It will be available for download from Google Play soon, and included in the next version of the Android OS \u2013 dubbed Android M - expected to be released this fall.\u201c[W]e\u2019ve approached Android Pay the same way we approach every other part of the Android family \u2013 partnering with the ecosystem \u2013 bringing together mobile carriers, payment networks, banks and retailers to deliver you choice and flexibility,\u201d states the Google announcement.\nAndroid Pay will be supported by leading financial service providers, including American Express, Visa, MasterCard, Citi and Bank of America. It will support NFC payments and biometric authentication tools, and it\u2019s designed to be easy to use and seamlessly compatible with all sorts of Android apps.\u201cInstead of relying on you to load the app and unlock it with a PIN, Android Pay lets you simply tap your phone on an NFC terminal to approve the purchase,\u201d notes Nicole Lee on Engadget. \u201cIn addition, Google is also allowing Android Pay to be integrated in apps like Lyft, Grubhub and Wish, so users can easily use that to pay for things. I just used Android Pay here at Google I/O, and I can say this: If it's as easy to use in real life, then I suspect mobile payments are about to be a lot more ubiquitous.\u201d\nA question that comes immediately to mind is whether the new Android Pay framework will support bitcoin payments. Since Android Pay is not an app controlled by Google, but a platform that can be used by all app developers, nothing seems to prevent Bitcoin payment services from using Android Pay to make bitcoin payments easier.\n\u201cTo make it easier for developers to add Android Pay to your favorite apps, we\u2019ve designed our platform to work with any payment processor,\u201d states the Google announcement. \u201cAnd we\u2019re partnering with top payments processors including Braintree, CyberSource, First Data, Stripe and Vantiv to make integration even easier.\u201d At least two of the payment processors mentioned, Stripe and Braintree, integrate bitcoin payments.\n\u201cToday, the latest \u2018what\u2019s next\u2019 was unveiled at Google I/O. Launching in the coming months, Android Pay will become the new mobile payment solution for consumers to make purchases with their Android devices,\u201d said Braintree\u2019s CTO Juan Benitez. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to share that we\u2019ve integrated Android Pay into the v.zero SDK to make it easier for our merchants to add it as a checkout option in their Android apps. We\u2019ve connected with Android Pay on our back end to reduce the number of API calls and provide a streamlined payment flow. Starting today, merchants can sign up for Braintree\u2019s private beta to be ready for Android Pay. With very little effort, merchants will be able to add Android Pay, in addition to credit and debit cards, PayPal, Venmo, Apple Pay, and bitcoin \u2013 all with a single integration.\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 2}

It is also one of the largest clearing houses in the world.\n\u201cI\u2019m very interested in the capabilities distributed payment technologies seem to offer for improving the safety, soundness and cost effectiveness of global payments and settlement infrastructures,\u201d Donahue said in a Ripple Labs press release. \u201cRipple is already a clear leader in this space; I\u2019m looking forward to working with the Ripple Labs team to deliver on these exciting possibilities.\u201d\nThe hunt for institutions\nThe addition of Donahue as an adviser comes at a great time for Ripple Labs. After creating the digital currency ripple in 2012 and supporting the development of it since, the startup has been looking for a use case that would set the digital currency on the road to mainstream adoption.\nFirst, the company focused on the potential of ripple for international consumer remittances, but more recently, it has pivoted to a new business-to-business use case; a settlement network for financial institutions.\n\u00a0According to Ripple Labs CEO and co-founder Chris Larsen, the new direction for the company and payment network has gotten quite a bit of traction so far. In a recent interview he said Ripple Labs already has about 30 partners in different stages; preliminary discussions, pilots and production, but who have yet to publically announce. However, Ripple Labs has publically announced it is working with Western Union, The Commonwealth Bank Of Australia and Fidor Bank, among others.\nAn industry veteran\nRipple Labs faces an uphill battle trying to get large financial institutions to adopt a settlement network that uses digital currency but Donahue\u2019s experience and connections in the sector will certainly help ease that challenge.\n\u00a0\u201cHe has spent an entire career building, assessing and safeguarding the country\u2019s financial technology infrastructure,\u201d Larsen said. \u201cHis insights will be invaluable as we continue to expand adoption of Ripple as payments infrastructure technology by financial institutions around the world.\u201d\nBesides serving as president and CEO for six years at DDTC, he was also the clearing house\u2019s COO prior to that. Before DDTC, he held several executive positions at American financial institutions, including the American Municipal Bond Insurance Services Corp, and advised the U.S. Treasury Department and other government departments about cyber security after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nImage via\u00a0dtcc.com", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 2}

ECUREX has also been the first digital currency exchange platform to be compliant with the Swiss Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Act since April 2014.\nSwitzerland considers digital currencies such as bitcoin equivalent to any other foreign currency. This means that the professional operation of Bitcoin trading platforms constitutes financial intermediation with the requirement to comply with both the Banking Act and the AML Act.\n\u201cSwitzerland probably has the most challenging regulatory environment for such a business and we are thrilled to be the first with a business model that allows us to operate here,\u201d said ECUREX CEO Paolo Tasca. \u201cWe think a stable regulatory environment is not only beneficial for us in the long term, but also for our customers.\n\u201dThe ECUREX trading system is not yet operating, but the team announced that this is the next important milestone. Within the next three to five years, the objective of ECUREX is to become the leading European digital finance hub for professional traders and financial institutions interested in digital currencies and blockchain technologies.\n\u201cBy observing the current trend in blockchain innovation, in the near future we envision a landscape where this disruptive technology will create more agile and disintermediated financial and economic systems,\u201d Tasca said in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cBlockchain technology will dramatically transform our economic systems, and our society in general, into something very different to what we have got used to thinking about in the last few decades. The disrupting force of the blockchain technology will hugely expand the use of digital currencies, because digital currencies and blockchain technology are an indissoluble tuple.\n\u201dHe added that in the coming years banknotes, coins, checks and credit cards will all become hugely inefficient and will be replaced by digital money, which is easier and faster to process. According to recent studies, by 2020 90 percent of all payment transactions made in the United States and more than 50 percent of those made in Europe will be cashless.\nRecently, the Denmark Central Bank declared that it will be discontinuing the printing of new fiat in 2016. Moreover, 45 percent of 25-34 year olds in the United States say they feel comfortable with the idea of using independently issued currencies.\nAt the moment there are more than four thousand privately issued currencies in more than 35 countries, and from 2009, when bitcoin was deployed in the market, there are now almost 500 different digital currencies.\n\u201cWe glimpse a future characterized by the creation and diffusion of \u2018brand\u2019 currencies that will be used in closed-form environments as tools for internal rewarding, customer loyalty programs or incentive and governance schemes,\u201d said Tasca. \u201cECUREX will be the single marketplace where users will instantly trade a massive range of online and offline, centralized and decentralized currencies cheaply and instantly.\u201d\nThe ECUREX platform targets primarily professional traders and financial institutions, and provides professional tools like technical indicators for chart analyses, the possibility to trade from charts, multiple drawing and annotation tools, market data, reports by ECUREX Research, network data, price and trading news, and sentiment Indices.\nThe goal of ECUREX Research, part of the New Finance European research consortium, is to keep innovating by identifying the most important trends in nascent digital economies, but also to push boundaries on topics such as decentralized finance, economic networks, and generally to conduct cutting-edge research at the border between economics and complex systems that will benefit the community as a whole.\n\u201cAt ECUREX Research, we believe that applied and fundamental research are complementary and yield benefits for the company, the industry and the world, and we have a long-term vision for independently funded, transdisciplinary science,\u201d said Tasca.\nECUREX will distinguish itself from leading Bitcoin exchanges such as Bitstamp and Coinbase because instead of focusing only on bitcoin, ECUREX will allow users to trade in real-time and high-frequency different pairs of crypto-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat.\n\u201cAt the moment there exist about 500 different digital currencies,\u201d said Tasca. \u201cThe digital currency market is so young that we welcome a Hayek's regime of competitive monies where in the coming few years different digital currency protocols will co-exist to serve different needs. This is why we consider ourselves as a digital finance marketplace, and not a bitcoin-restricted exchange.\u201d\u00a0\nPhoto Rob Pongsajapan\n\n\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/pong/288491653\n / CC BY 2.0\n", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 1}

The event was organized through a partnership with NextBank Asia and sponsored by international bank Wells Fargo and European startup accelerator Level39.\nBitSpark will now progress to the finals, which will be held in October at Singapore Sibos, where it will have the opportunity to win $50,000 and as well as support from the international payment network SWIFT.\nOther winners of the Singaporean competition were social consumer credit rating startup Trustingsocial, automated risk management platform provider Jewel Paymentech, online payment processor Codapay, and mobile payments solution provider goSwift. Each of the 15 startups that participated in the event had to pitch the company to a panel of judges, which was composed of financial technology experts and entrepreneurs from the Asia-Pacific region.\nBitSpark will be competing against 20 other fintech startups in the finals. Besides the Asian competition winners, finalists from Innotribe competitions held in North America, Africa and Europe will also be competing. The North American showcase has yet to held, and so far only one other digital currency startup progressed to finals. Elliptic, a secure storage service for a variety of assets using the blockchain, won the European showcase in April.\nConnecting offline remittances\nBitSpark secured a spot in the finals with a new service they announced during the competition. BitSpark CEO George Harrap told Bitcoin Magazine the new service is a way for offline remittance agents to offer online remittances through the startup\u2019s Bitcoin international technology.\n\u201cWith Bitspark, traditionally offline small business remittance shops (who can service the unbanked) are brought online, and online remittance services (who cannot access the unbanked/unconnected) are now able to connect with unbanked customers,\u201d said Harrap.\nThe new service aims to solve of one of Bitcoin remittances\u2019 biggest hurdles: digital. The vast majority of senders and receivers are still offline, cash-loving and might not have the best access to the Internet.\nOnline is still tiny part of global remittances, around 10 to 15 percent, though that is changing. BitSpark will continue to follow the company\u2019s philosophy of \u201cbitcoin in the background,\u201d or cash-in and cash-out, so consumers don\u2019t need to bother handling the digital currency.\nBitSpark already operates its online Bitcoin remittance service in a several parts of Asia, including mainland China, Indonesia, the Philippines and Hong Kong. The startup uses only Bitcoin as payment rails, and users send and receive fiat. It has previously explored ways to cater to offline remitters with pre-paid cards in the Philippines and a physical point-of-presence in Hong Kong.\nDeveloping an agent network\nBitSpark will try to entice remittance agents to join the startup\u2019s service by offering a subscription-fee model instead of the commission model offered by Western Union, MoneyGram and others. Attracting agents and building a large agent network is crucial for the success of the service.\nInstead of giving a cut of each transaction to BitSpark, agents within their network will pay a yet-to-be-defined monthly fee to be part of the service. According to Harrap, the pricing model will put much more cash in the pockets of agents compared to existing remittance companies.\nThe Bitcoin startup said it already has a number of operators signed up, but whether the different fee model will be compelling enough to incentivize the number of agents it needs to join is a big if. Established offline remittance services offer a trusted brand and large customer base, both of which are huge for getting volume and subsequent agent earnings. Though it varies from country to country, in many places agents make between 30 percent to 45 percent.\nThat percentage might seem small, but even with a large cut going to remittance companies such as Western Union, agents are likely making a good living from the large volume provided by such brands.\nBitSpark did not elaborate in detail about the new service but said more information would be available closer its launch in July.", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 30}

The central bank has given 360 days to all financial institutions in Ecuador to get on board. Top financial institutions with assets of more than $1 billion USD will have only 120 days to comply.Ecuador\u2019s official Resolution 064-2015-M, announced on May 25, states that all entities of the public, private, and cooperative financial sectors must join the government-run Electronic Currency System as \u201cMacro Agents.\u201d\u00a0\nFinancial institutions will have to provide an electronic tender option for all the services they currently offer and those they will subsequently offer. The text of the resolution (in Spanish) is available online on the government\u2019s website.The new resolution comes less than one year after the government asked Congress to approve the creation of the new currency, with the condition that its adoption should be voluntary, El Diario Financiero reports. Though President Rafael Correa criticized the use of the U.S. dollar in the country, because it limits the ability of the government to incentivize falling exportations, he said his administration is not planning to stop using the U.S. dollar.\n\"The new institutional vision of the central bank considers financial inclusion and the modernization of payment systems as strategic objectives.\" states the resolution, which was approved on April 16 but officially published last week. The new electronic currency \"seeks efficiency in payment systems to promote and contribute to the economic stability of the country.\u201d\nFalling oil prices \u2013 oil exportations account for 25 percent is the country\u2019s income \u2013 and the rising exchange value of the U.S. dollar due to the recovering U.S. economy have caused a liquidity crisis in Ecuador.\nThe new electronic currency isn\u2019t related to bitcoin. The U.S. dollar has been the only official legal tender in Ecuador for the past 15 years. Alternative currencies such as bitcoin are banned. The citizens of Ecuador who want to invest in bitcoin or other digital currencies can do so only outside of Ecuadorian territory. Not surprisingly, the strong opposition of the government of Ecuador is motivated by the fact that bitcoin has no regulating or supervisory body.Bitcoin users in Ecuador criticize the government\u2019s Electronic Currency System because it eliminates privacy from all financial transactions.\n\u201cWith the electronic currency all transactions are linked to your identity, something which doesn\u2019t happen with physical money, so it seems like a de facto acquired right is being progressively lost,\u201d bitcoin advocate Luis Nu\u00f1ez told the PanAm Post. \u201cBitcoin has a decentralized model that has clear rules: It\u2019s transparent and public, it promotes freedom, and it\u2019s adopted freely; the other is a centralized model that seeks to control information, and in which the rules conform to the political vision of the day.\u201d\nOther governments are warming up to the idea of digital currencies controlled by the state \u2013 of course, with the privacy aspect taken out. There are rumors of \u201cFedcoin\u201d in the United States and some kind of \u201cEurocoin\u201d in Europe.

If you have a trust charter, you don\u2019t need a BitLicense and vice versa.\nCompanies reporting suspicious activities to federal authorities do not have to also report to NYDFS.\n\u201cPassive investors\u201d joining companies do not have to report or get approval. Only a \u201ccontrol person\u201d will need to report to the regulators.\n\nLawsky noted that his office received 4,000 comments after the first draft was released but only 35 comments after the second draft was released, so they figured they must be closer to \u201cgetting it right.\u201d\nWho is covered under the BitLicense program\u00a0\nBusinesses covered include those \u201ccontrolling, administering or issuing a virtual currency\u201d with the following exemptions:\n\nBlockchain technology for noncurrency purposes\nSoftware developers that aren\u2019t engaged directly in money transmission or exchange\nMiners\nIndividual investors\nMerchants who accept bitcoin\nLicensed banks\n\nCriticisms from the Digital Currencies Community\nMany businesses and organizations in the Bitcoin space submitted comments to Lawsky\u2019s office noting that the regulations would create a \u201cbitcoin backwater\u201d as digital currency businesses simply move elsewhere to friendlier jurisdictions.Organizations such as Coin Center\u00a0and companies such as Coinbase noted that the BitLicense rules simply added another layer of regulations to laws that already exist at the federal level to cover money laundering and fraud.\u00a0In addition, many commented that Lawsky\u2019s rules put too high a financial burden on new startups, requiring them to buy a license and pay for reporting to government.\nThe Revolving Door\nAs was reported\u00a0earlier, the Cato Institute and others have criticized Lawsky for taking advantage of his role in developing the BitLicense rules and then moving to the private sector to offer consultation and advice on these same regulations.\n\u00a0", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 4}

The blockchain possesses a seemingly infinite number of use cases, and those who can think creatively and be the first movers in a certain sector are pioneering some of the those brilliant ideas into our everyday lives. The creation of many of these apps allow for the seamless and frictionless transference of value in a myriad of ways.\u00a0\nAbra, founded by its CEO Bill Barhydt, is currently preparing to disrupt the status quo and bring the future of cash to anyone with a mobile device. Bitcoin Magazine recently spoke with Barhydt on his personal history, and gained some intel on the vision of his\u00a0company's mobile payment/remittance service, Abra.\u00a0\nBarhydt is a veteran in the payments technology/mobile industry, and has been working in the field for more than 20 years, going back to his days at Netscape directing business development; working on projects throughout the years in e-commerce, and mobile wallets almost 10 years ago. Barhydt has historically been ahead of his time, and spoke a bit about the company:\n\u201cI got the idea for Abra quite a long time ago. The holy grail is to be able to store cash on a smartphone and take it anywhere. I always knew what I had to do in a hyper-connected world. But there were a lot of underlying issues: handset compatibility, cost of bandwidth in developing markets, cost issues. I had an \u2018aha\u2019 moment where I realized all the tools were finally available for a global network. This was the impetus.\u201d\nThe tools are all here. But the Bitcoin blockchain is the one essential piece of the puzzle that is finally enabling a service such as Abra to finally exist. We asked Barhydt what his initial reaction was when learning about bitcoin and the Bitcoin white paper:\n\u201cI was one of the first people to read the white paper. I\u2019ve been on these mailing lists since back in my '90s long-hair days. I had been tracking it and staying current. When I saw the link, initially the title grabbed me, and I had done enough work to know anything mentioning \u2018decentralized\u2019 is a big deal. People just thought \u2018Bill\u2019s off on another one of this tangents.\u2019 I had printed it out and I poured over it late into the night. I knew it was a total game-changer.\u201d\nFinally having these tools in place, Barhydt knew what he had to do. But what ultimately lead him to come up with the idea for \u201cAbra\" and what does he think of the other emerging remittance platforms in the bitcoin industry?\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at \u2018Abra\u2019 like it's a remittance platform. Remittance is just a use case. Remittance is more a man-in-the-middle transfer solution. It\u2019s a notable business, yes, but with Abra we\u2019re turning phones into banks. And, because you store from your phone, you can do P2P transfer with anyone without a intermediary.\"\nThis is a great example of how Abra is differentiating itself from the competition that simply wants to aid in the transfer of funds digitally. Barhydt went on to discuss a few more points\"\n\u201cOnce you have a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) model it\u2019s no longer remittance, it\u2019s a P2P transfer banking solution. Eliminating intermediaries makes for a cheaper, more secure and\u00a0robust system with less middlemen. One of the goals of Abra is make the best money transfer and payment solution in the world, replacing them with a P2P model for moving money around. At some point Abra is going to have the ability to make payments as well. Banks are not at risk from us; we don\u2019t do credit, service loans, not a notary, etc. Our plan is to more so replace cash than banks. PESA in Kenya is a good example of this. The first generation of consumer Bitcoin apps will replace cash-based systems. \"\nSomething such as Abra that seeks to use the blockchain to provide more freedom back to the people from a financial standpoint is seen as a positive and is reminiscent of a recent post on Fortune. Using blockchain technology allows for a more distributed financial system that lends power back to the people who need it the most.The blockchain is great for building next-generation financial applications. But what else is Abra\u2019s system going to do to maintain its major differentiation? Barhydt shared what success looks like in the short term for Abra.\n\u201cI want to see Abra Tellers live in dozens of countries in the next year with millions of consumers transacting with each other.\u201d Abra \u201cTellers\u201d are a pivotal part of Abra\u2019s magic in making money transfer more seamless. The tellers allow for you to add cash, or withdraw from your Abra app by finding the nearest trusted Abra teller and exchanging cash. You can also deposit cash into your account via a debit card.\u00a0\nBarhydt seems assured his short-term goal is achievable. But the long-term goals of an innovational organization such as Abra should always be considered.\n\u201cWe gotta sell it [Abra] to consumers first. An incredible number of technical challenges still await while we continue building Abra. Smart contracts, user experience, building out our trusted-teller networks, actively engaging with regulators to explain how Abra works to gain more approval; it\u2019s a never-ending process.\u00a0\n\"Tellers are realizing they can make money. There are many pre-registers in multiple countries already. And, there's no current marketing or PR right now. Abra Tellers can make more money with the same cash they have. Faster is the incentive here. We\u2019re creating a positive feedback loop of making money over time. People are getting that, slowly. Time will tell. There exists a chicken and an egg problem we have to solve.\u201d\nWhat everyone else in the Bitcoin community will care most about is the execution during the launch of this platform. We all love new features, however. So, we asked if there is anything in the pipeline we can look forward to as they continue to spread to other locations with their new innovative service.\n\u201cPayment APIs have been the number one request.\u00a0\u2018When can online merchants and etc. use Abra as a payment vehicle?\u2018\u00a0is a question we get often. We\u2019ll be releasing that in the next few months. There are a bunch of other goodies, too, that we\u2019re not quite ready to announce yet as well.\u201d\nMany merchants are obviously very eager to get their hands on a zero percent fee, secure payment system. With so many incentives, it\u2019ll be a huge boon for the overall bitcoin community.\nWe also asked Barhydt what other initiatives in the Bitcoin space he\u2019s most excited about.\n\u201cExchanges are good, they create the ecosystem. I also read about a company called\u00a0Streamium, I\u2019m very impressed with them and excited for that use case. There aren\u2019t enough startups solving consumer problems and negative affairs. We designed Abra to rid the consumer of pain. Using bitcoin came second. Nothing was better than using bitcoin.\u201d\nA blend of Streamium\u2019s real-time streaming service and Abra\u2019s upcoming payment API would be a positive move for the bitcoin industry. It makes for a sensible combination of complimentary services. Both are great examples of platforms using blockchain technology to empower people.\nAt the end at the end of our extended discussion, Barhydt shared this food for thought about Abra:\n\u201cAs a company, we believe in the rights of the consumer and taking a part in commerce with their money. At Abra, we believe the right to the consumer comes before the government. We believe there are bad people out there who will do bad things, and government plays the role of being that intermediary; but that should not be at the expense of human rights. We\u2019re staunch proponents of consumers rights, and we\u2019re engaging with governments and regulators and understanding their perspectives and insights to reduce surprises. Regulators have not been a real issue thus far, with exceptions of that Ripple nonsense. Things are early. We think gaining mindshare and being transparent will eliminate the possibility of pushback.\u201d\nAbra is revolutionary: no transfer fees, a secure and private system that is instant and convenient, no foreign exchanges risks or bank account required. It is truly a service built for the people. This author, personally, is very excited for the future of digital cash.\u00a0", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 2}

The bitcoin transfer was enough to inspire them to found Moneytis in early 2014 and make a bitcoin-based solutions without the user-experience issues.\nSince then, Tatur and his co-founder Christophe Lassuyt have been developing the company\u2019s money-transfer technology and refining its user experience from feedback gathered from the private beta.\n\u201cWe are thrilled to release publicly our online solution and to see the feedback of our first users,\" said Tatur, Moneytis CTO. \"Some of them already used the solution to send money to their family and to pay education fees.\u201d\nNiche Market\n2012 data gathered by the World Bank\nFirst, it is a pure digital remittance provider, which is a very small section of the market. Estimates vary, but Ismail Ahmed, CEO of digital remittance provider WorldRemit, said digital represented only of 5 percent of total remittance volume. Second, it currently provides only bank-to-bank transfers, which is probably more limiting as it alienates a large amount of remitters who send and receive cash via physical stores and the online remitters who favor quickness.\nAll things considered, if Moneytis was a remittance provider where the user actually needed to use bitcoin it would be in a much more niche market.\nBut it's a start, and already, in terms of number of corridors, Moneytis is among the head of the pack when it comes to bitcoin remittances. In order to grow, the startup is planning to expand beyond bank-to-bank transfers and add more payment options in the future.\n\n", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 4}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nThe FinCEN action against XRP II LLC (Ripple) took many by surprise early last month, although many in the Bitcoin community were not shocked to see an organization with such close ties to a digital token face backlash for \u201cwillful violations\u201d of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and failure to implement appropriate anti-money laundering (AML) procedures.\nThe Chamber of Digital Commerce has been quick to gain an in-depth understanding of the action taken against Ripple Labs, and the Washington, D.C.-based trade association plans to discuss the implications of the regulatory action in a public briefing June 4th at 1 p.m. EDT.\nBefore their briefing, the Chamber of Digital Commerce was willing to answer a few questions related to the Ripple case via email. Chamber of Digital Commerce President Perianne Boring provided input on the Ripple case with added assistance from Carol Van Cleef of the trade association\u2019s advisory board.\nChanges to the Ripple Protocol?\nIn the minds of many digital currency advocates, the most troubling aspect of the Ripple action was the agreement to make regulatory compliant changes to the Ripple protocol. Of course, as Boring pointed out, Ripple Labs seemed to disagree with this assessment of the deal with FinCEN via a piece in the Wall Street Journal. The WSJ article contained statements from Ripple Labs Bank Secrecy Act Officer Antoinette O\u2019Gorman:\u201cAll that Ripple had agreed to, she said, was to build enhanced \u2018analytical transaction monitoring tools for monitoring transactions across the protocol\u2019 and to furnish information drawn from that monitoring to U.S. authorities upon request. The changes had \u2018nothing to do with the protocol itself,\u2019 she said.\"\nBoring added that this would be a key point of discussion during the Thursday briefing. When speaking specifically about what changes Ripple Labs would have to make due to their agreement with FinCEN, Boring stated:\u201cThis is consistent with FinCEN\u2019s minimum standards for money service businesses, which states that \u2018money services businesses that have automated data processing systems should integrate into their systems compliance procedures such as recordkeeping and monitoring transactions subject to reporting requirements.\u2019 Given these expectations, as a practical matter, the analytical tools must either be incorporated into the protocol or be built on top of the protocol to enable the company to monitor transactions.\u201d\nMore Action to Come from FinCEN\nDue to the swift action from FinCEN and their partner agencies on the Ripple situation, it should come as no surprise to find that the Digital Chamber of Commerce also finds more action from FinCEN against various businesses involved with token issuances and crowd sales to be \u201cinevitable.\u201d Boring pointed to a May 6th keynote speech by FinCEN Director Jennifer Shasky Cavalry at the West Coast AML Forum in which the director indicated that a series of supervisory examinations of virtual currency businesses has recently been launched by the IRS.\nBoring added:\u201cPlease note that it is the IRS that conducts such examinations for FinCEN. Any deficiencies detected in these examinations are then reported to FinCEN. FinCEN then may decide to take enforcement action. With the laser focus right now on these businesses, we expect more actions are inevitable.\u201d\nThe president of the Digital Chamber of Commerce also noted, \u201cIRS examinations are not the only way that virtual currency businesses may find themselves vulnerable to enforcement actions by FinCEN.\u201d She pointed to ongoing criminal investigations and even press coverage as two other activities that could trigger an investigation by another regulatory body such as the SEC.\nPublic Briefing on the Ripple Action\nIn an effort to bring more clarity to the current regulatory environment in terms of token issuances, crowd sales, and other activities surrounding digital currencies, the Chamber of Digital Commerce is holding an industry briefing on Thursday, June 4 at 1 p.m. EDT (10 a.m. PDT). The key points of the briefing will be to:\n Discuss the implications of the first civil money penalty action against a digital currency company; Gain a more in-depth understanding of what it means for companies in the ecosystem; Evaluate what steps need to be taken immediately to minimize or eliminate potential violations; Assess how to prepare for upcoming Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) examinations by the IRS.\nregister\nAs part of her final comments, Boring added a few notes about the importance of regulatory clarity in the digital currency ecosystem:\u201cInvestors don\u2019t fear regulation; they fear uncertainly. Gaining regulatory clarity is an important part of the development and growth of this industry.\u201d\nIn order to help with the ever-changing regulatory landscape in the digital currency industry, the Chamber of Digital Commerce has put together the first AML compliance course specifically designed for businesses involved with bitcoin and other digital assets. Boring noted, \u201cThe Chamber will continue to take a leadership role by advancing the public-private sector dialogue, offering educational webinars and training sessions, and serving as a clearinghouse for information sharing within the industry.\u201d\n", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 4}

The conference examines how rapidly accelerating technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, crowdfunding, digital currencies and robotics are rapidly disrupting businesses throughout the financial industry.\nThe Singularity University, based at Moffett Federal Airfield in California and sponsored by high-profile high-tech firms including Google, is an educational center dedicated to world-changing applications of disruptive, exponentially accelerating technologies.\nThe conference program features an impressive set of high-profile speakers including Blythe Masters, the former J.P. Morgan star who now leads Digital Asset Holdings, a technology company that uses distributed digital ledgers tao address operational challenges and settlement latency in both digital and mainstream financial assets. Masters\u2019 presentation, titled \u201cBlockchain: The Financial Challenge of Our Time,\u201d has been featured in a CNBC article titled \u201cWhy financial firms are investigating bitcoin tech.\u201d\nMasters discussed why major financial institutions and their regulators should explore the potential for technologies like the blockchain. She also examined how distributed ledger technologies can help make financial transactions more transparent, efficient and secure with thoughtful protection and collaboration by the industry. A video clip of Masters\u2019 presentation is available online.\nAccording to Masters, the technological innovation behind Bitcoin has the potential to empower the existing financial world, not just disrupt banks out of existence as some have foretold.\n\u201cThere is a school of libertarian \u2018visionaries\u2019 who want to imagine a world without big banks, big governments,\u201d she said in a recent interview. \u201cThat\u2019s nice, but completely irrelevant to [Digital Asset Holdings\u2019] business model. We don\u2019t imagine a world in which big banks and big governments don\u2019t exist.\u201d\nMasters said at Exponential Finance 2015 that Bitcoin's underlying technology has the opportunity to improve settlement latency and system security for firms, and, therefore, the market for financial blockchain applications will ultimately be measured in the trillions.\nShe added that major financial firms have all begun to dedicate a significant amount of time and effort to learning about the technology. Masters\u2019 company Digital Assets Holdings \u201cbridges the gap between the blockchain development world and financial services,\u201d Masters said.\n\u201cIf you can find a way to bridge the two of them then you have something that is truly revolutionary,\u201d she said in a previous interview.\nThe Singularity University\u2019s news site Singularity Hub reports that Masters cautions against the hype. The world, she says, is a long way away from economies tabulated on blockchain-enabled disributed ledgers. We need to determine whether they can withstand a concerted attack, can handle transactions on a truly global scale, and can maintain privacy. At the same time, Masters believes that the blockchain may prove incredibly empowering for existing organizations that embrace it. \u201cHow seriously should you take this?\u201d she asked. \u201cAbout as seriously as you should have taken the concept of the Internet in the early 1990s. It\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\nThe CNBC article lists many other recent examples of how high-profile banks and financial institutions are exploring the financial applications of the blockchain. The list includes Banco Santander, Barclays, UBS, BNY Mellon, IBM, Intel, Overstock, Nasdaq, and the U.S. Federal Reserve, all of which have been featured in recent Bitcoin Magazine articles to show how the technology of the blockchain is gradually winning support in both Wall Street and Capitol Hill.\nIn the past six months, \"everybody realized that bitcoin's more than a currency,\" said Brian Kelly of Brian Kelly Capital. \"Everybody had their 'aha' moment, and investors with many millions of dollars to spend are starting to see how it can be used.\" He added that the financial community was slow to come around to this technology, but they are beginning to embrace it as a cost-saving tool.\u00a0\nPhoto courtesy of Exponential Finance", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 4}

The debit card is SpectroCoin\u2019s latest effort to make spending bitcoin easy in the region, something the startup holds is crucial to the long-term success of the digital currency.\n\u201cFor SpectroCoin users, it means broader spectrum of withdrawal options, as they are no longer dependent on their bank card and do not have to wait for wire transfer to be able to withdraw cash, which means quicker and cheaper link between bitcoin and cash for SpectroCoin users,\u201d SpectroCoin co-founder and CEO Vytautas Karalevi\u010dius told Bitcoin Magazine via email. \u201cIt is a step towards being one-stop shop for bitcoin.\u201d\nFees and spending limits\nFor point-of-sale purchases, no fees are charged but a one percent fee is tacked on when loading the card with bitcoin. Using the card to withdraw cash through an ATM in United Kingdom costs \u20ac2.25; in any other country there is a \u20ac2.75 fee.\nThe maximum loading limit and card balance is \u20ac10,000 for verified users; \u20ac1,000 is the maxium cash withdrawing limit. To get verified, a card-holder must provide a form of ID and a utility bill. For unverified users, the limits of are one-fourth that of verified users.\nSpectroCoin was unwilling to share who issued the card when asked by Bitcoin Magazine, but did say it was issued by a company in Gibraltar, an overseas British territory south of Spain, which is regulated by the country\u2019s Financial Services Commission. Gibraltar is part of the European Union, and as such local financial companies are also regulated by E.U. governing bodies.\nSpectroCoin\u2019s announcement comes a week after Bitcoin Magazine reported on another European exchange, BitStamp, which released a debit card as well. Their card is similar to the Baltic startup\u2019s, including the fees and spending limits, but BitStamps\u2019 also allowed for users to receive a digital debit card.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 4}

As reported by Fortune, the lawsuit is over whether Xapo was originally developed during his and other Xapo employees\u2019 time working for Lemon. Or as LifeLock\u2019s compliant puts it, \u201cusing a product developed by Lemon employees, in Lemon\u2019s facilities, on Lemon\u2019s computers, and on Lemon\u2019s dime.\u201d\nSeveral months before Lemon would be acquired by LifeLock, the mobile wallet startup started working on a Bitcoin product, but the project was quickly terminated by its board of directors. Casares, Lemon CEO at the time, pushed on with the digital currency product, which was a Bitcoin storage service for himself and other Lemon executives (one of Xapo\u2019s core services).He approached LifeLock\u2019s board with a letter that asked them to acknowledge they sought no stake of his Bitcoin vault\u2019s intellectual property. In a letter dated February 12, \u00a02014 and signed by LifeLock president Hillary Schneider, LifeLock acknowledges that it does not hold any claim to Bitcoin intellectual property and transfers all rights to Casares.\nCasares also asked for letters requesting permission for Lemon/LifeLock employees to work on his bitcoin project in their free time. When four out of five of these requests were rejected by Schneider, Casares announced he would resign from his role as Lemon\u2019s CEO. A week later, on March, 13, 2014, Xapo\u2019s launch was announced, along with a $20 million funding round raised from Benchmark, Ribbit Capital and Fortress Investment Group.According to LifeLock, the security company has found overwhelming evidence that Casares, former Lemon engineer Frederico Murrone (Xapo co-founder and COO), and former Lemon general counsel Cynthia McAdam (Xapo president), along with two other former Lemon employees, were developing the Bitcoin startup with Lemon\u2019s resources.\nLifeLock is not suing Xapo, at least not yet (a judgment in Lifelock's favor in current lawsuits could open the door to the Bitcoin startup being next). But the security company is seeking damages from its former employees for their alleged misactions. Specifically, they are seeking reimbursement for \u201cthe value of the Xapo product attributable to Defendants\u2019 misrepresentations, omissions, breaches of duty, and other wrongful conduct.\u201d\nBesides having to potentially pay back a large settlement to their former employer, having much of Xapo\u2019s executive team losing a civil lawsuit could be damaging for the financial service startup\u2019s reputation and relationship with existing financial institutions, such as banks.Neither Xapo nor any of the accused former Lemon employees have made any public statements on the lawsuit, but Casares\u2019 attorney Steven Ragland, who also is representing McAdam, provided Bitcoin Magazine the following:\n\u201cThis is a baseless lawsuit. LifeLock has no right to any Bitcoin-related business or IP that Wences Casares or his colleagues may have worked on during their time at Lemon or after. As LifeLock\u2019s President has attested in a legally binding document, LifeLock does not have any right, claim or interest to any Bitcoin IP. LifeLock\u2019s claims lack merit and we look forward to proving their allegations false.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with additional information about the letter regarding Bitcoin intellectual property signed by Caesares and Schenider.", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 5}

An anonymous source has provided information to Bitcoin Magazine regarding the possibility of a Bitcoin cloud mining ponzi scheme involving Bitcoin Cloud Services (BCS), which is currently one of the largest cloud-mining providers on the market.\nFounded by a known scammer with Photoshop\n\nOne of the common attributes of a Ponzi scheme in the Bitcoin world is a reliance on anonymous owners. BTC Cloud Services LTD is registered to Gabriel Kleiman and Esteban Amador Soto Martinez.While the first name does not bring up any identifying information online, the second name is associated with another bitcoin-related scam, bitcoincloudhashing.com. This information is available publicly on the bitcointalk forums thanks to Puppet\u2019s Cloudmining 101 thread, but it hasn't stopped an estimated 4,300 users from signing up at Bitcoin Cloud Services. BCS also claims to be a silver member of the Bitcoin Foundation on their website, even though the foundation recently dropped the cloud mining company as a sponsor.\nFurther, the pictures of a supposed mining facility on the Bitcoin Cloud Services website\u00a0contain no information about the mining facility or its owners besides a single banner hanging in the background.\u00a0Compare to the\u00a0photo below from Genesis Mining showing CEO Marco Streng in one of the company's mining farms.\n \nEditor's Note: This photo of Genesis Mining CEO Marco Streng is provided courtesy of Genesis Mining and provided for comparison and reference only. Genesis Mining is not connected to Bitcoin Cloud Services in any way.\nThe \u201ccompany\u201d also released a poorly made video based off the Photoshopped images in an effort to bring more legitimacy to their activities:\nThe supporting evidence on the blockchain\nOne of the key pieces of data provided by the anonymous source is a spreadsheet compiled via publicly available data on the Bitcoin blockchain but we do not know the specific bitcoin mining software used. By watching Bitcoin Cloud Services\u2019 payout address, the anonymous source was able to estimate the number of customers receiving payouts, along with BCS\u2019s profits and losses. BCS seems to have started to operate at a loss near the end of April. How did BCS respond? By offering an extra year on their currently available mining contracts. Typical behavior of a Bitcoin cloud mining ponzi scheme.\n\nThis offer could be an attempt to keep a Ponzi scheme going for as long as possible. After all, it will last only as long as new money is coming in. The back-of-the-envelope math based on the spreadsheet indicates that the operators could run off with as much as 2,500 BTC ($570,000 at current prices) with a\u00a0bitcoin mining scam.\nIf it looks like a duck...\nGoing back to Puppet\u2019s Cloud Mining 101 thread, it seems clear that he understands the likelihood that BCS is a Ponzi scheme. The thread lists seven different criteria that are usually found in a Ponzi scheme, and BCS fits the bill in six out of seven criteria. The only test that BCS seems to have passed is having pictures of their mining facility on their website. Of course, as Puppet notes in his thread, \u201cPictures can be faked.\u201d This seems to be what has happened in the case of Bitcoin Cloud Services. Puppet currently has BCS listed under \u201cLikely Ponzi scams that have yet to collapse,\u201d and it\u2019s unclear how long BCS will be able to keep up the charade. Up to this point, Puppet has been correct with 95 percent of his calls of a probable Bitcoin cloud mining ponzi scheme.\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine\u00a0has reached out to BCS for comment.", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 6}

Copay multi-sig wallet is a shared bitcoin wallet, in which each owner holds a unique private key and the ability to push out payments or withdrawals. A transaction initiated in a Copay multi-sig wallet requires the approval of multiple people \u2013 efficient for businesses and privacy-conscious users.\n\u201cWith Copay, a small company can, for example, manage their bitcoin holdings by requiring 3 of 5 officers to sign transactions that spend funds,\" BitPay Chairman\u00a0Tony Gallippi explained. \"A household can use a 2-of-3 wallet to manage family funds (with one signer on a device tucked away in a secure, offline location in case someone accidentally loses their online wallet). A parent can use a 2-of-3 wallet with their child to moderate the child\u2019s spending habits and ensure they don\u2019t accidentally lose bitcoins to a virus. There are many more possibilities.\u201d\nThe Copay multi-signature wallet provides a convenient flow for sending funds from shared wallets which small or co-owned business could greatly benefit from. For example, a small online business on e-commerce platforms such as E-Bay or Amazon could adopt the Copay wallet to combine the budget of the business into one shared wallet and then allocate the expenses through approvals from different departments of the company.Furthermore, the Copay multi-signature wallet brings the security of bitcoin wallet into a whole new level.\u00a0\nEven if a bitcoin wallet service provider or exchange were ever compromised, the private keys would not be, so the possessed bitcoin would not be affected.Copay wallet is also the first bitcoin wallet to support the bitcoin testnet on both iOS and Windows Phones. This feature allows developers to create / test new bitcoin applications across different platforms with ease. This may also pave the way for additional blockchains to be added to the Copay wallet, including altcoins or other blockchains built on top of the bitcoin protocol such as Counterparty and ChainDB, another BitPay project.\nSecurity and Open Source\n\u201cWe\u2019re serious about security and privacy. Not only is the Copay app open source, the server is too,\u201d BitPay\u2019s development team announced on BitPay\u2019s official blog.\nThe development of Copay began in 2014, following research of Gallippi which stated that not a single account from the world\u2019s top 100 richest bitcoin accounts was secured with multi-sig technology. With a vision to ease the process of securing wallets with multi-sig technology and to increase the number of multi-signature wallets globally, BitPay created Copay on bitcore on July 9, 2014.\u201cI\u2019d like to see 10 percent of bitcoin in existence stored in multi-signature wallets,\u201d Gallippi said.\nWithin a few days after its launch, over 1000 BTC has been stored on Copay already and the open source code on GitHub is being contributed by hundreds of bitcoin developers worldwide, offering improvements in the code\u00a0\u00a0 s and new features that could increase the east of use of the Copay wallet.", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 7}

In the past the primary way to provide this guarantee has been for the tenant to deposit funds, in trust, with the landlord. The landlord takes custody, but not ownership of the funds. The obvious problem is that, aside from ethical and legal obligations, a landlord has no incentive to return a tenant\u2019s security deposit - which is why almost everyone who has been a renter has a \u201cthey-didn\u2019t-return-my-security-deposit\u201d story.\nCustodial security deposits present the same problems as most custodial accounts. Custodial accounts are easy to \u201cborrow\u201d from. In the case of security deposits, the penalties for misuse of funds are comparatively low to the reward of keeping the money and most tenants will not actually sue to recover a deposit. While some jurisdictions require that landlords hold security deposits in a separate account, some don\u2019t. In the end it really doesn\u2019t matter whether the funds are in a separate account or not because they\u2019re controlled solely by the landlord with little, if any, oversight by tenants or anyone else.\nUnfortunately, many landlords have a standard practice of not returning security deposits regardless of the condition of the premises. When the tenant receives a form notice that they\u2019re not getting their deposit back, they\u2019re faced with two choices: fight or walk away. Often the deposit amount simply isn\u2019t enough to justify taking time away from work, traveling to a jurisdiction where they may no longer live, and presenting evidence before a court where success is never guaranteed. Undocumented residents and those hiding from domestic abusers cannot go to court to recover deposits. Regardless of the reason, many tenants simply walk away. Angry at the landlord. Angry at the system.\nWe can do better.\nUsing bitcoin\u2019s multisignature address feature we can create a 2-of-3 address, where the tenant is a signer, the landlord is a signer, and a trusted disinterested third party holds the third key. In minutes, and from anywhere in the world, the tenant, landlord, and third party can combine public addresses to create a multi-signature address with a 2-of-3 signing configuration. Once the address is created, the tenant funds the address. All parties can verify on the public blockchain, within 10 minutes, that the funding has occurred and within about an hour the landlord can be confident that the funds will be there at the end of the term. Then nothing happens for a year. Or more. The landlord cannot misappropriate funds, as it takes two signers to move funds out of the account. At the end of the lease, the tenant creates a transaction transferring the entire deposit to another tenant-owned address. The tenant sends the transaction to the landlord for signing. If the property is damaged the landlord can send a counter transaction and ask the tenant to sign. The landlord and tenant can then negotiate among themselves. If they cannot reach agreement, they can get the third party signer involved.\nWith or without nLockTime, bitcoin\u2019s multisignature addresses are superior to traditional custodial landlord accounts because they ensure landlords do not unlawfully commingle, keep, or spend the tenant\u2019s funds. It balances the power between the parties and provides public oversight through the network. Importantly, the third party is not involved if the landlord and tenant agree on the refund amount themselves. This keeps costs down and encourages communication. Finally, the parties are still protected by traditional landlord/tenant laws and the third party would be required to follow those laws. This is one example of ensuring due process through technology.\nPhoto modified from\u00a0BTC Keychain\u00a0/ CC BY 2.0", "year": 2015, "month": 6, "day": 5}

The Wall Street Journal reported that Nasdaq will start with a pilot project in Nasdaq Private Market, a recently launched marketplace that handles pre-IPO trading among private companies.\n\u201cUtilizing the blockchain is a natural digital evolution for managing physical securities,\u201d said Nasdaq CEO Bob Greifeld in the announcement. Speaking with The Financial Times, Greifeld noted that he wants Nasdaq to be \u201ca leader in the field.\u201d He added that the network could potentially revolutionize the time it takes to finalize deals on U.S. securities markets.\n\u201cI am a big believer in the ability of blockchain technology to effect fundamental change in the infrastructure of the financial services industry,\u201d said Greifeld. \u201cClearinghouses are a wonderful invention, but if you have a public ledger that is trusted, you can evolve back to a bilateral (trading) world but proceed with instantaneous settlement. We currently settle at T+3 [within 3 days]. Why not settle in 5-10 minutes?\u201d\nThe Financial Times notes that shortening settlement times for trading could reduce the risk that counterparties would not be paid, while also cutting the amount of collateral, or insurance, used to back trades. For the Nasdaq Private Market, using the blockchain means transforming the recording of transactions from paper certificates and spreadsheets to an audited record of the lineage of ownership of private securities.\nThe Financial Times\u2019 article includes a video with explanations about Bitcoin and the blockchain. The video notes that everyone from banks to stock exchanges and Silicon Valley technologists are starting to make bets on Bitcoin companies.\nDavid Birch, Director of Consult Hyperion, a specialist electronic transactions consulting firm that advises governments and large companies on electronic identity and electronic money, believes that the real value of Bitcoin is independent of the highly volatile exchange rate of the bitcoin currency.\n\u201cI think when you see people investing in Bitcoin, it sounds like they are investing in the currency,\u201d Birch says in The Financial Times video. \u201cBut I think you\u2019ll find they are not really. The institutional money that is going in, is going into the underlying technology, not the payment instrument itself. So, investing in Bitcoin doesn\u2019t really mean investing in bitcoin. It means investing in what they call the blockchain technology, which is the new technology that sits underneath Bitcoin.\u201d\nBirch acknowledges the importance of bitcoin price as a means to incentivize end-users to participate in keeping the Bitcoin blockchain going, but he is persuaded that \u201cin the long run, that is unsustainable.\u201d He notes that the Bitcoin blockchain is not the only blockchain, but there are other blockchains and other ways of incentivizing people to maintain blockchains.\nIt appears that Birch agrees with the growing persuasion, in the financial and regulatory sectors, that the promising blockchain technology will eventually have to be adapted to non-Bitcoin blockchains with different features, more appealing to the financial mainstream. In a recent research paper titled \u201cOne Bank Research Agenda,\u201d the Bank of England called for further research to devise a system that could use distributed ledger technology without compromising a central bank\u2019s ability to control its currency.\nNasdaq isn\u2019t planning to develop an alternative blockchain. Rather, it plans to leverage the colored coin protocol Open Assets, which works on the original Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nPhoto bifshadow / Flickr", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 26}

In particular, the government is launching a \u00a310 million (U.S. $14.6 million) research initiative on digital currencies.\nOne of the replies to the U.K. government call for information came from the global bank Citi. The bank is persuaded that digital money adoption is inevitable, and the U.K. government should consider issuing its own digital money, Finextra reports. The full text of the Citi document was obtained by CoinDesk via a Freedom of Information request.\nHeadquartered in Manhattan, Citi is an American multinational banking and financial services corporation. As of January 2015, it is the third-largest bank holding company in the United States by assets and has one of the world\u2019s largest financial services networks.\n\u201cDue to the potential benefits, we believe the adoption of Digital Money is inevitable,\u201d notes the Citi document. \u201cWhile we believe that the use of Digital Money is certain, the future of specific cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is less clear.\u201d\nThe wording shows that Citi agrees with the growing persuasion, in the financial and regulatory sectors, that the promising blockchain technology will eventually have to be adapted to non-Bitcoin blockchains with different features, more appealing to the financial mainstream.\nRecently the Bank of England itself called for further research to devise a system that could use distributed ledger technology without compromising a central bank\u2019s ability to control its currency. Similar ideas were discussed at a research workshop organized by the European Commission.\n\u201cThe greatest benefits of digital currencies can be realized through the government issuing a digital form of legal tender,\u201d notes the Citi document. \u201cThis currency would be less expensive, more efficient, and provide greater transparency than current physical legal tender or electronic methods.\u201d\nCiti recommends that the U.K. government work together with regulators in other nations to establish a common platform, if possible, within the framework of existing regulations and laws.\n\u201cThe decision by a government to issue its own digital money would resolve the majority of national AML, KYC and sanctions concerns,\u201d adds the Citi document. \u201cClearly this creates possible privacy concerns on the side of the citizen, but it could be offset by the additional value digital money provides.\u201d\nThe idea of a government-sponsored digital currency has been around for quite some time. In February, David Andolfatto, vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, wrote a blog post about \u201cFedcoin: On the Desirability of a Government Cryptocurrency.\u201d Similarly, Greece\u2019s Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis envisaged some kind of \u201cEurocoin\u201d for Europe, especially for financially troubled economies such as Greece\u2019s.\nOne thing is certain: Governments and established financial institutions risk obsolescence if they don\u2019t act soon.\n\u201cWe believe that Governments and the Financial Industry incumbents are not currently leveraging the benefits of emerging technologies and risk similar challenges to that of the Post Office during the shift to digital forms of communication,\u201d warns Citi.\n\nPhoto Uris / CC BY-SA 3.0", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 27}

Popper tells the story of Bitcoin from its geeky, libertarian early days to the beginnings of the current phase marked by significant venture capital investments and growing adoption by the financial community.\nPopper\u2019s book contributes to the ongoing Bitcoin vs. blockchain debate. Once a bitcoin-like digital currency is adopted by banks and governments, will it still be recognizable as bitcoin, or rather become a sanitized blockchain controlled by central banks, with all the troublesome features of bitcoin removed?\n\u201cA company like Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan is hesitant to rely or work with a financial network in which the people keeping it alive are essentially anonymous,\u201d says Popper in a Forbes interview. \u201cBanks have to know who\u2019s transacting and flag it if someone suspicious is involved in the transaction. But it\u2019s quite easy in Bitcoin to have an identity tied to an address in a way that would make a bank feel comfortable.\u201d\nPopper released previously undisclosed information in a section of his book, re-published by American Banker magazine with the title \u201cWhen Goldman Sachs Began Flirting with Bitcoin.\u201d\nGoldman Sachs is one of the most respected financial companies in the world, often considered as epitome of the best \u2013 and the worst \u2013 of today\u2019s financial system. Therefore, Goldman Sachs\u2019 take on bitcoin can be considered as representative of the financial industry as a whole.\nRecently, after stating in a report that Bitcoin could shape the future of finance, Goldman Sachs participated as lead investor in a $50 million funding round for startup \u201cBitcoin bank\u201d Circle in one of the highest profile investments in a Bitcoin company to date.\nFinancial operators are attracted by blockchain-based financial networks with no single point of failure, which could keep running even if one of the participating nodes stops working or is taken out. They are also attracted by the relative speed and low cost of blockchain transactions.\nIt currently takes the bank three or so days to settle stock trades, says Popper. \u201cWhat if that could happen instantly and be recorded on a blockchain for everyone to see?\u201d\nBut, according to Popper, Bitcoin remains a thorny issue for Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and other top financial players. The problems are Bitcoin\u2019s potential for anonymity, and the fact that the Bitcoin blockchain is \u201cpowered by thousands of unvetted computers around the world, all of which could stop supporting the blockchain at any moment.\u201d\nPopper reports that JPMorgan and other major banks envisaged a new blockchain that would be jointly run by the computers of the largest banks and serve as the backbone for a new, instant payment system without a single point of failure. The new blockchain, decentralized but closed, would offer the benefits of the current Bitcoin network without relying on end-users for its operations.\nIBM has recently developed a similar concept for a non-Bitcoin, closed blockchain for central banks. Even governments are warming up to the idea, with rumors of \u201cFedcoin\u201d in the United States and some kind of \u201cEurocoin\u201d in Europe, especially in financially troubled economies such as Greece\u2019s.\nIn a research paper titled \u201cOne Bank Research Agenda,\u201d the Bank of England called for further research to devise a system that could use distributed ledger technology without compromising a central bank\u2019s ability to control its currency.\nIt appears that financial institutions, central bank and governments are, indeed, flirting with the blockchain but determined to leave the open, pseudonymous and peer-to-peer (P2P) features of Bitcoin out. If so, Goldman Sachs\u2019 investment in Circle could be seen as an intermediate, preparatory step to test the waters before implementing a non-Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nPhoto by Laslovarga / CC SA 3.0", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 26}

Clef is becoming increasingly popular for Bitcoin companies who are interested in growing their audience, especially companies on the rise like BitQuick. BitQuick has rapidly grown their volume by circumventing some of the traditional requirements for buying Bitcoin and making the process take hours instead of days. In an industry where every millisecond is tracked to help increase sales, speed is a huge asset both for the company and for the entire Bitcoin ecosystem.\nA growing appeal of Clef is the network of sites which already use it. More than 70,000 sites, including popular Bitcoin networks like AlphaPoint, have already integrated Clef. Users of those sites have already gotten rid of some passwords, but actively seek out new sites where they can use Clef. This translates to an influx of new users for sites that integrate Clef and then a steady stream as it is added to Clef\u2019s recommendation engine. The increased traffic had overwhelmed some unprepared sites, so Clef now works to even out the initial spike.\nBitQuick\u2019s speed is the headline selling point, but the service has also developed a reputation for spotting and thwarting potential scams. The slowness of other services is rooted in their fraud-prevention systems, so BitQuick has used its volume to focus on learning patterns that help identify fraud and squash it before it happens. Other services leave the fraud detection completely to the users, who cannot have the same high-level perspective and learnings. BitQuick has also integrated with Purse, and Fold to make their speedy Bitcoin purchases available for people making purchases at Amazon or Starbucks.\n\u201cEveryone in the ecosystem is talking about friction, and how we can reduce the friction in using Bitcoin,\u201d said Brennen Byrne, CEO of Clef. \u201cBut the first Bitcoin purchase is still unforgivably slow on most systems. That\u2019s why we\u2019re so excited to see BitQuick solving the Bitcoin purchase problem. To get more people owning and spending Bitcoin is the key, and I know that Clef users are going to love BitQuick.\nBitQuick does not require everyone trading on their platform to make accounts, but the cases where users do need to log in are particularly important to protect. Making two-factor authentication accessible for those users, and also making it really easy to use, helps them build more trust with their users. Typically, sites that offer two-factor auth see fewer than 1% of users opt in to protect their accounts, but sites that use Clef have seen more than 50% of their users opt in to the safer login. To make the process simple and seamless, Clef recognizes a user\u2019s phone instead of anything they need to remember or type.\n\u201cFor us, Clef is more than just an evolved two-factor solution,\u201d said Jad Mubaslat, CEO of BitQuick. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about using Clef to replace confusing passwords altogether. This improves both the experience and security habits of our users.\u201d\nA customer can log into BitQuick on any computer in the world by holding their phone up to the computer screen. Clef uses the phone\u2019s camera and an animation called the Clef Wave to seamlessly sync with the computer and log the user in. The process is backed by the same public key cryptography as Bitcoin wallets and is available for free on any iOS or Android device.\nAbout Clef\nClef is an Oakland startup building the two-factor of the future. By taking advantage of the rapid spread of mobile devices, Clef has built technology that is not only much more secure than traditional logins, but also much easier to use. Since 2013, Clef has spread to more than 70,000 sites and received accolades from The New York Times, Inc. Magazine, and The Economist. Clef is funded by Morado Ventures and angels from a broad variety of product and security backgrounds.

Since 2014, Bitcoin Indonesia continued to aggressively push the project in Bali, where BitIslands launched a bitcoin Information Center and Bali\u2019s first offline Bitcoin exchange.\nDue to the increase of bitcoin\u2019s market awareness and merchant adoption, the majority of the locals started to use bitcoin online, and began to appreciate bitcoin\u2019s low transaction fees and speed, The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\u201cMost Indonesians currently use bitcoin to pay for services online, such as web hosting. They can also use the digital currency to book hotel rooms through travel websites hosted overseas rather than use credit cards, which only a small percentage of the population currently own,\u201d the Journal article says.\nFurthermore, major bitcoin exchanges such as Bitcoin Indonesia have seen a substantial growth in both the number of users and daily trading volumes. The largest bitcoin exchange in Indonesia currently trades around 200 bitcoin daily and supports more than 56,000 users.\n\u201cMany people think that Bitcoin is unheard of in Indonesia, but the fact is its popularity is soaring now,\u201d Bitcoin Indonesia CEO Oscar Darmawan said.\nIn September 2014, several projects emerged to increase bitcoin mainstream adoption in the nation, by allowing Indonesian residents to purchase bitcoin at popular stores or tourist spots. The project ran by Bitcoin Indonesia enabled users of its exchange to purchase bitcoin at any of the 10,000 Indomarket convenience stores via a partnership with iPaymu, a merchant payment platform.\nSuch services, along with the rising volume of Bitcoin exchanges, influenced Indonesian merchants to accept bitcoin in other parts of Indonesia apart from Bali, where most of the Bitcoin projects began. Currently, Indonesia has more than 50 Bitcoin merchants, and the majority are located in Denpasar.\nRise of Bitcoin Startups\nSince early 2015, some Bitcoin startups began to relocate to Indonesia, targeting the poor banking systems and payment infrastructure of the country. One of the startups was Blossom, which recently moved from San Francisco to Indonesia to offer the country\u2019s first bitcoin-based global lending/investing platform.\nBlossom connects international investors to small businesses in Indonesia which are ready to launch. Through an established local microfinance institution, Blossom delivers the bitcoin funds to the businesses. After 12 months, profits from the businesses are collected to be distributed to the investors, with around 7.5 percent to 12.5 percent in return.\n\u201cIn conventional investment, I have to rely on the statements and numbers publicized by my partners. With Bitcoin, it\u2019s clear to everyone what\u2019s going on,\u201d said founder Matthew Martin.\nAs the number of bitcoin merchants and trading volumes continue to grow at a consistent rate, Bitcoin startups and establishments, including Bitcoin Indonesia, aim to achieve mainstream bitcoin adoption in popular tourist spots in the country.", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 26}

Benefits offered by an employer can be a deciding factor for a potential employee\u2019s job decision. The cost of doing business is ever increasing, and with it, employee savings requirements. The traditional idea that pension plans will take care of an employee\u2019s financial needs upon retirement is quickly becoming obsolete. The relationship between employers and employees needs urgent re-examination, and a new mindset of partnership for mutual benefit and survival is necessary.\n\u201cEmployees are struggling to secure their financial future. This means high stress, increased anxiety, lower productivity, and diminishing loyalty that breeds high staff turnover. High interest credit cards are being used to supplement cash flow. Furthermore, these fraud-prone cards have high transaction costs and shockingly high chargebacks that are paid for by the merchant, anywhere up to 8%, thus impeding business, jobs, and wage growth. I see Digital Currency adoption as a solution to high transaction costs for merchants, and inflated prices for essential consumer goods,\u201d said DNotes Co-founder Alan Yong.\nSelf-Employment Trending Down\nYong, a pioneer from the early days of mobile computing, pointed out that while small businesses continue to be the main incubator of job creation in the US economy, the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics data showed that entrepreneurship is in steady decline, with both incorporated and unincorporated self-employment dropping nearly ten percent since 2004. Small business numbers have not recovered in line with economic growth since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. Yong attributes this in part to small business owners having difficulty meeting costly payroll, healthcare obligations, mounting regulations, and funding their own retirement accounts.\nWhy is CRISP for Employee Incentive Benefits Plan the Solution? And What are DNotes?\nCRISP for Employee Incentive Benefits will facilitate the distribution of digital currency called DNotes \u2013 a cryptographically secure digital currency which is the most reliably appreciating and stable currency in its class. DNotes has increased against the US dollar more than 30 fold since its inception in February 2014 and centers its business strategy on creating a stable trustworthy digital currency from the ground up for everyone, whether they are rich or poor. DNotes promotes trust and integrity for the long-term mutual benefit of all as it continues to work towards further capital appreciation. As DNotes positions itself to be the predominant digital currency used for global payments, with instantly cleared payments at near zero transaction costs, multiple strategic plans are systematically executed to ensure that DNotes becomes the foremost digital currency to supplement fiat currency worldwide.\nHow Will the Program Work?\nDirector of CRISP for Employee Incentive Benefits, Marc Fortenberry, said that employers will register for the program by completing a simple online form at https://dnotesvault.com/crisp-for-employees.php. Each employer will have a main dashboard which will include a company specific link for their employees to sign up. The employer dashboard will also have a table that shows employee details to facilitate instant balance transfers into their accounts. The employer will then be able to send DNotes to reward their staff as they see fit. Every approved employer registration will receive 1,000 DNotes to get them started.\nEmployees need to have a DNotesVault account, and sign up with the link given to their employer, which requires only the employee\u2019s e-mail used to register at DNotesVault. When submitted, a new address is created in the employee\u2019s DNotesVault account that is identified with their company name.\nAbout Alan Yong:\nDNotes Co-Founder Alan Yong is a well regarded visionary since the early days of personal computers. He founded Dauphin Technology in 1989 and is best known for creating the Dauphin DTR, the most powerful window-based miniature computer that competed head on with Apple\u2019s Newton computer that became the Apple Iphone as we know it today. In 2007, Yong co-founded Smokeys Daylily Gardens, one of the largest daylily growers in the world. Smokeys Daylily Gardens is the first merchant to accept DNotes as payment for daylily purchases. Alan recently shared his thoughts on the disruptive potential of Bitcoin, blockchain technology and DNotes in an interview.\nYong agrees with other industry\u2019s visionaries that digital currency and the Blockchain technology will be the greatest technology revolution since the Internet. However, he passionately believes that to gain mass acceptance, the currency must be built from ground up for everyone with trust and integrity. There must be strong leadership and sufficient self-interest from its community to promote and protect the currency\u2019s stability for the long-term mutual benefits of all participants.", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 26}

He also helped Merriman comply with SEC and FINRA requirements. Much like the current state of Bitcoin regulations, the compliance requirements for the SEC and FINRA were new and very unclear at the time.\nAccording to a Kraken blog post, Bernstein will help manage the company\u2019s day-to-day compliance program and begin to engage regulatory officials and lawmakers. But the new CCO also marks a change of heart for the exchange about the U.S. market, a country Kraken doesn\u2019t operate in, but which contributes greatly to bitcoin\u2019s trading volume.\nThe San Francisco-based exchange previously swore off the U.S. market, having said that the country\u2019s regulations were too nascent to know what they needed to comply with. Kraken instead focused its efforts on Europe and Japan, which it found to have simpler financial regulations.\nBernstein will now led the exchange\u2019s efforts to get a U.S. banking partner and necessary financial licenses so the trading platform can operate in the country.\n\u201cWe are working toward being able to operate legally in the United States,\u201d Kraken CEO and founder Jesse Powell told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cUnlike most other services, we\u2019ve chosen to stay out of the U.S. until we have the necessary licenses, which has put us at a substantial competitive disadvantage. We\u2019re looking forward to entering our home market.\u201d\nHe added that the new CCO is also re-evaluating Kraken\u2019s existing compliance programs in Japan and Europe.\n\u201cWe plan to better localize our compliance efforts and adjust to a more customized risk-based model, as opposed to the generalized policy we have now, which might in some cases be too strict, and in other cases not strict enough,\u201d Powell said.\n\nImage via Kraken.", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 27}

Proposed by Assemblyman Rai Mukherji (D-Hudson) and Assemblyman Gordon Johnson (D-Bergen), the 30-page bill would create a regulatory framework for digital currency companies to operate within as well.\nThe bill comes two months after New Jersey\u2019s Assembly Financial Institutions and Insurance committee held a two hour hearing about Bitcoin. The New Jersey Treasury officially recognized the digital currency in April when it wrote that digital currency transactions were subject to sales tax and would be treated as barter.\nThe Star-Ledger reported that the new bill, titled the \u201cDigital Currency Jobs Creation Act,\u201d would qualify companies for up to $5,000 in tax write-offs for each new job they create and exempt Bitcoin companies from having to pay tax on electricity. The legislation would also require companies to have an \u201ceffective cyber-security program\u201d and hire a chief security officer.\n\u201cYou need a lot of firepower by way of technology to be in this business,\u201d Mukherji said. \u201cIt would try to ease some of that burden.\u201d\nHe added that he is unsure whether the bill, which was yet to be introduced to the state Senate, would advance, but said some regulation would be needed.\n\u201cThe legislation clarifies where digital currency stands sort of in the rubric of New Jersey law. In other states that\u2019s been confusing,\u201d Mukherji told The Star-Ledger. \u201cI think this would be the first statute of its kind in the country. We would be establishing the framework legislatively.\u201d\nTaxes, Violations and Job Growth\nThe bill, which hopes to encourage digital currency job growth in the state, aims to both set up a regulatory framework for startups to work within as well as provide incentives in the form of tax cuts.\nIf passed, digital currency companies directly or indirectly involved with the creation of Bitcoin would not need to pay sales tax on all purchases of energy and utilities, not just electricity. The bill also included a passage which would safeguard startups from unnecessary intrusion from state authorities. It stated it would stop state municipalities \u201cfrom prohibiting, abridging, levying a tax upon or otherwise restricting the creation, retention, transmission or any other use of the digital currency within the state, except as otherwise provided for in the bill\u201d.\nThe Digital Currency Job Creation Act would also allow individuals and companies to pay their taxes with Bitcoin but did not mention if the same would be true for other digital currencies.\nLastly, the bill would require employees, founders and stakeholders who handle any digital currency assets of a company to be fingerprinted by The New Jersey Commissioner of Banking and Insurance. It would also give the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance the ability to fine bitcoin startups up to $5,000 for violations of the act.\nUpdated at 3/24/2015 1:00 PM EEST to add additional information about the bill after it has been made public.\n\nPhoto The Virginia House / CC BY-SA 2.0", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 28}

Topics range from decentralization of education, to virtual worlds and politics related to everything crypto.\nRun by Eric Martindale (Bitpay), James Walpole (Bitpay), Tony Sakish (Augur) and Chaz Ferguson, Decentralize.fm started eight months ago with their first guest, country singer Shooter Jennings, who talked about cryptocurrency as well as decentralization in music.\nTheir latest episode is with Ryan X. Charles, former astrophysicist, veteran of BitPay and Reddit, and current software engineer at BitGo. Ryan comments on BitGo\u2019s Innovators Patent Agreement which has recently created a stir.\nTheir unbiased approach toward Bitcoin adds a new flavor to podcasting about the digital currency, an example being their interview with Steve Albini, who\u2019s produced records for Nirvana, The Pixies, PJ Harvey, Cheap Trick and many others. Albini\u2019s take on Bitcoin might not be positive, but is a refreshing one nonetheless.\nTrace Mayer\u2019s Bitcoin Knowledge PodcastConsidered a Bitcoin legend by many, Trace Mayer is most renowned for being one of digital currency\u2019s earliest adopters, while the market cap was still less than $2 million, Mayer had already helped fund Armory, Bitpay & Kraken.\nHis podcasts usually span 15 to 30 minutes and are updated as often as once every three days.

Based on blockchain technology, it enables payment using different currencies \u2013 real-world, digital or even gold and silver. The system was developed to integrate traditional currency platforms with the emerging blockchain technology that drives digital currencies such as bitcoin.\n\u201cTRUST is taking its first step into getting widespread adoption and integration with existing systems,\u201d said Tembusu co-founder and CEO Andras Kristof. \u201cWe\u2019re planning to try out several possible use cases with current payment systems in Singapore, and the success of this trial will see the use of digital currency payment systems being extended into real-world context.\u201d\nA first demo, conducted in local uptown bar The Spiffy Dapper \u2013 which also hosted Singapore\u2019s first Bitcoin ATM in 2014 \u2013 showed how the TRUST framework could be easily implemented with a computer or mobile device attached to existing POS systems. An interesting feature of the TRUST system is that it allows consumers to withdraw cash through participating businesses by processing currencies from their digital wallets to the POS systems. Businesses will then be able to cash out the digital payment into cash for consumers over the counter.\n\u201cThe potential for blockchain technology is seemingly limitless, and Tembusu Systems is continuously exploring using our TRUST platform in other applications,\u201d said Tembusu co-founder and COO Jarrod Luo. \u201cOur goal is not to replace other payment systems like NETS and credit cards, or even checks. In fact, we are hoping the TRUST platform can be developed to integrate with these other systems, to become an organic payment integrator in time to come.\u201d\nTRUST, a next-generation distributed blockchain technology, stands for \u201cTembusu Reputation-based Universally Secure Transaction System.\u201d The Tembusu website outlines the advantages of the platforms for consumers and businesses, and includes as well a section titled \u201cTRUST for Governments.\u201d\nThe government section outlines the benefits of TRUST from the point of view of central banks, law enforcement and regulatory bodies: Every user on the TRUST network is a real and identifiable person, every transaction is permanently recorded and verifiable on the blockchain (so taxes can be easily filed and verified), and the cost of maintaining and creating physical money can be reduced by using a robust, persistent, low-cost cryptocurrency.\nThese statements seem to imply that Tembusu is planning to develop custom implementations of the TRUST platform for governments. In fact, governments are warming up to the idea of state-controlled cryptocurerncies, with rumors of \u201cFedcoin\u201d in the United States and some kind of \u201cEurocoin\u201d in Europe. Greece\u2019s Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis wrote a blog post in February proposing a cryptocurrency dubbed Future Tax Coin (FT-Coin). Varoufakis is not impressed by bitcoin as a currency, but he is persuaded that its underlying technology could be put to effective use in troubled economies.\nVaroufakis was an adviser to Tembusu Systems and helped to build a key part of its founding strategy until the end of 2014. Though Varoufakis has not played any active role for Tembusu since his decision to stand in Greece\u2019s elections, the company still considers him as an adviser because of his foundational contributions. Therefore, it seems plausible that systems such as TRUST for governments could be candidates for actual implementation in Greece. In fact, Tembusu System stated that it is keen to explore working partnerships with institutions that want to leverage the power of the blockchain for their operations.\n\nImage via tembusu.sg.", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 28}

CBA is also considered to be part of the \u201cbig four\u201d Australian banks, alongside National Australia Bank (NAB), ANZ and Westpac.\nWhen contacted by Bitcoin Magazine, a CBA spokesman confirmed the bank has been experimenting with Ripple and added that Commonwealth Bank will continue to test \u201ccrypto protocols\u201d and soon \u201cbegin a wider experiment with one of our offshore subsidiaries to explore the benefits of interbank transfers using these protocols. The idea is to test in a controlled environment what a bank-to-bank internal transfer might look like using crypto rather than existing payment providers.\u201d\nThe spokesman also stressed that use of Ripple\u2019s payment network will stay within the Commonwealth Bank Group and they will continue \u201cto comply with all legal and regulatory requirements.\nThe news comes a week after Ripple Labs announced a $28 million series A funding round and a pivot to institutional use cases. Previously, the digital currency startup aimed to leverage its payment network for cheaper and more efficient remittances but now, Ripple Labs is focusing its efforts on \u201ccorrespondent banking, domestic transfers and corporate treasury\u201d applications.\nRipple Labs previously announced partnerships and pilots with several financial institutions, including global remittance provider Western Union, but according to Ripple CEO and founder Chris Larsen, there are many more that haven\u2019t yet been publically announced.\nIn an interview on the BreakingBanks Radio Show with guest host Chris Skinner, a fintech author and founder of the Financial Services Club, Larsen said, \u201cWe have about 30 partners in various stages of proof-of-concept, pilot and production. We have to respect when our partners want to announce they are using our infrastructure. We are very, very excited and pleased with the uptake we are seeing.\u201d\n\nPhoto Mattinbgn / CC 3.0 Unported", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 28}
{"title": "Blockstream Starts Development on the Lightning Network", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/blockstream-starts-development-lightning-network-1432931728/", "birthday": "May 29, 2015  4:35 PM EST", "date": "2015-05-29 21:35:00", "content": "The authors of the much-discussed Bitcoin Sidechains paper \u201cEnabling Blockchain Innovations with Pegged Sidechains,\u201d released in October, have formed the company Blockstream to develop new ways to accelerate innovation in digital currencies, open assets and smart contracts. In November, Blockstream closed a $21 million seed funding round with nearly 40 investors, including well-known pioneers of the Internet and financial services sectors.\nThe Bitcoin Sidechains paper envisages an ecosystem of \u201csidechains\u201d separate from the main Bitcoin blockchain but interoperable with it. A sidechain can carry bitcoin as currency, in which case users will be able to seamlessly transfer bitcoin between the sidechain and the main blockchain. At the same time, the sidechain can implement changes from Bitcoin Core. For example, a sidechain can implement more powerful scripting features or more watertight privacy.\nFor a readable explanation of sidechains, see \u201cA simple explanation of Bitcoin \u2018Sidechains,\u201d by Richard Gendal Brown, executive architect for banking innovation at IBM UK.\n\u201c[A]t any point, whoever is holding these coins on the sidechain can send them back to the Bitcoin network by creating a special transaction on the sidechain that immobilizes the bitcoins on the sidechain,\u201d explains Gendal Brown. \u201cThey\u2019ll disappear from the sidechain and become available again on the Bitcoin network, under the control of whoever last owned them on the sidechain.\u201d\nThe deployment of sidechains interoperable with Bitcoin requires the implementation of suitable hooks in Bitcoin Core. That will inevitably take some time, but it\u2019s worth noting that some Blockstream team members are also Bitcoin Core developers.\nIn February, developers Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja released a first draft version another much-discussed paper, proposing a decentralized Bitcoin Lightning Network where related transactions can take place instantly on \u201cmicropayment channels\u201d off-chain, and only the final settlement is processed by the blockchain. According to the authors, lightning networks would enable bitcoin scalability, efficient micropayments, and near-instant transactions.\nThe implementation of lightning networks would also require appropriate tweaks to Bitcoin core. Some developers have noted that there is a certain degree of affinity between sidechains and lightning networks.\n\u201cOther approaches seek to modify Bitcoin protocols in various ways,\u201d wrote Robert McGrath. \u201cFor example, Sidechains aim to create alternative blockchains hanging off the main blockchain, which would help limit the costs of the main blockchain. Another variant is the Lightning network, which aims to allow some transactions to be performed \u201con the side,\u201d and on send the results to the main blockchain.\u201d\nRusty Russell, an Australian developer known for his work on the Linux kernel, wrote a series of blog posts about interesting features of lightning networks. \u201cThe key revelation of the paper is that we can have a network of arbitrarily complicated transactions, such that they aren\u2019t on the blockchain (and thus are fast, cheap and extremely scalable), but at every point are ready to be dropped onto the blockchain for resolution if there\u2019s a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is genuinely revolutionary.\u201d\nNow it appears that the development efforts for sidechains and lightning networks are coming together. Russell, who joined Blockstream a few weeks ago, is working on lightning networks, and one of his first actions was to set up a Blockstream-hosted mailing list for \u201cDiscussion of the development of the Lightning Network, a caching layer for bitcoin.\u201d The new mailing list archives are freely accessible.\n\u201cThey hired me,\u201d Russell said on Reddit. \u201cWe agreed I\u2019d be working on developing lightning. I set up a mailing list and am developing a toy prototype to explore the ideas. Will put on github once that\u2019s ready (two weeks?) but it\u2019s a long long way from anything someone could use. I\u2019m excited about lightning, but it\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint.\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 29}

Gox", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-gets-slashdotted-creation-mt-gox-1432938208/", "birthday": "May 29, 2015  6:23 PM EST", "date": "2015-05-29 23:23:00", "content": "From DIGITAL GOLD by Nathaniel Popper\nHeadphones on and an oversize can of MadCroc energy drink by his side, Martti sat at his dorm room desk, giddy. Slashdot, a go-to news site for computer geeks the world over, was going to post an article about Martti\u2019s pet project. Bitcoin, largely ignored over the last year, was on the verge of receiving global attention.The campaign to get Bitcoin real press coverage had begun a few weeks earlier, not long after Martti finished his three-month internship at Siemens. A new version of Bitcoin, version 0.3, was being prepared for release by Satoshi, and the regulars on the forum saw a perfect opportunity to get the word out.\nMartti agreed with a handful of other users that Slashdot would be the best place to do this. \u201cSlashdot with its millions of tech-savvy readers would be awesome, perhaps the best imaginable!\u201d Martti wrote on the forum. \u201cI just hope the server can stand getting \u2018slashdotted.\u2019 \u201d\nA small crew went back and forth about the right language to submit to the Slashdot editors. Satoshi got his hackles up when someone suggested Bitcoin be sold as \u201coutside the reach of any government.\u201d\u00a0\u201cI am definitely not making any such taunt or assertion,\u201d Satoshi wrote. He quickly apologized for being a wet blanket: \u201cWriting a description for this thing for general audiences is bloody hard. There\u2019s nothing to relate it to.\u201d\nAfter Martti suggested his own changes, the final version made the more modest assertion that \u201cthe community is hopeful the currency will remain outside the reach of any government.\u201d When the item went online, shortly after midnight in Helsinki, it wasn\u2019t anything more than the single paragraph the Bitcoin team had submitted.\u201cHow\u2019s this for a disruptive technology?\u201d it began. \u201cBitcoin is a peer-to-peer, network-based digital currency with no central bank, and no transaction fees.\"\u00a0\nDespite the modesty of the item, the Internet chat channel that Martti had established for the Bitcoin community quickly lit up. NewLibertyStandard wrote: \u201cfront page!!!\u201d.\u00a0Regulars like Laszlo made a point of being on the Bitcoin chat channel, to answer questions and serve as a tour guide of sorts for any newbies who checked in after reading the story. In his dorm room, Martti posted a message on Facebook: \u201cIf I was a smoker, I would have smoked two packs already.\u201dMartti watched as the counters, which tracked the number of users on the forum and the chat channel, ticked steadily upward.\nMessages crowded his forum in-box; and the Bitcoin website, running on servers that could not handle more than one hundred viewers at a time, began to slow. Within an hour, the limit was reached and the whole site went down. Martti scrambled to scale up the site\u2019s capacity with the company that rented him space. But this, and the derogatory comments that showed up under the Slashdot item, did not dampen his enthusiasm. This was what he\u2019d been waiting for for months.\u00a0\nChapter 5\nJuly 12, 2010\u00a0When he awoke late, the morning after the Slashdot posting, Martti Malmi saw that the attention was not a hit-and- run phenomenon. People weren\u2019t just taking a look at the site and moving on. They were also downloading and running the Bitcoin software. The number of downloads would jump from around three thousand in June to over twenty thousand in July. The day after the Slashdot piece appeared, Gavin Andresen\u2019s Bitcoin faucet gave away 5,000 Bitcoins\u00a0and was running empty. As he begged for donations, he marveled at the strength of the network:\u00a0\nOver the last two days of Bitcoin being \u201cslashdotted\u201d I haven\u2019t heard of ANY problems with Bitcoin transactions getting lost, or of the network crashing due to the load, or any problem at all with the core functionality.\u00a0\nBut while the Bitcoin software itself was working well, new users quickly ran up against the limitations of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Those who immediately wanted to acquire more Bitcoins than were available from Gavin\u2019s faucet were left with only a few meager options, one of them a creaky, unreliable service that Martti had set up a few months earlier.Jed McCaleb was one of the people who encountered this weakness. A native of Arkansas, Jed had been raised by his single mother, who made a living as a journalist. From a young age, Jed had been something of a math and science prodigy, and this allowed him to make it to Berkeley for college. Jed, though, had trouble sticking with things, and he soon dropped out of Berkeley and moved to New York.\nThere he and a partner set up what became one of the main successors to Napster. His software, eDonkey, made it possible for individuals to trade large files like movies and it proved so successful that the Recording Industry Association of America sued Jed and his business partner. They eventually paid $30 million to settle the case and shut eDonkey down, but they also earned a few million along the way.Despite being a soft-spoke introvert, Jed had a cool way about him that helped him make friends and girlfriends. When one of his romantic flings ended up pregnant, he and the woman, MiSoon, decided somewhat spontaneously to keep the baby and make a go of it. They used some of Jed\u2019s earnings to buy an estate with a pool an hour or so north of New York City, just as they were expecting a second baby.\nIn the sprawling, mostly empty house, Jed threw himself into an online game he had created called The Far Wilds, which had attracted only a few aficionados. He spent endless hours in a first-floor bedroom, which he had turned into a den. Books about neuroscience and artificial intelligence piled up around him\u2014as did old food, attracting bugs that MiSoon initially tried to get rid of, but later came to accept as one of the side effects of Jed\u2019s brilliant mind.When Jed came across the Slashdot post about Bitcoin he was immediately intrigued. It seemed to fulfill many of the ideals behind Napster and eDonkey\u2014taking power from authorities and giving it to individuals. But when Jed tried to buy some actual Bitcoins, he ran into the limitations of the few existing sites that sold them.MiSoon was nursing their newborn son when she wandered into Jed\u2019s study one night and encountered his frustration. \u201cThere\u2019s this really cool thing called Bitcoin\u2014 it\u2019s like this nerd, libertarian thing,\u201d\nJed told MiSoon, in his hushed, intense voice. \u201cBut it\u2019s so lame. I can\u2019t buy any at night.\u201dJed said he wanted to build a site himself where he could buy coins at any hour. When MiSoon arose the next morning, it was done. With some experience in amateur foreign-currency trading, Jed knew the basics of what an exchange required. But he had never actually set up a website before, having previously worked more on the sophisticated back-end software.\nHis new Bitcoin exchange was something of a fun experiment.He and MiSoon discussed possible names for the site. He mentioned an old domain name that he owned and was not using\u2014mtgox.com. Jed had bought the site in 2007, for use as an online exchange to buy and sell the cards used in the role-playing game Magic: The Gathering hence the acronym for Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange. It had operated for just a few months before Jed shut it down and the site had been vacant since.\u201cYeah, you should use that,\u201d MiSoon replied. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of weird and easy to remember. Why not if you already have it registered?\u201dSeven days after the Slashdot post, Jed casually advertised his new site on the Bitcoin forum:\u00a0\nHi Everyone,I just put up a new Bitcoin exchange.Please let me know what you think.\nMt. Gox was a significant departure from the exchanges that already existed, primarily because Jed offered to take money from customers into his PayPal account and thereby risk violating the PayPal prohibition on buying and selling currencies. This meant that Jed could receive funds from almost anywhere in the world. What\u2019s more, customers didn\u2019t have to send Jed money each time they wanted to do a trade. Instead, they could hold money\u2014both dollars and Bitcoins\u2014 in Jed\u2019s account and then trade in either direction at any time as long as they had sufficient funds, much as in a traditional brokerage account.These advances made it significantly more convenient to buy and sell Bitcoins, but also brought new dangers that threatened to betray some of the currency\u2019s basic principles.\nSatoshi had designed Bitcoin to eliminate the need for trusted central authorities. It was supposed to be a new money that people could hold on their own, without a bank, secured with a private key that only the user knew. Mt. Gox customers would be moving back to the old model in which a single institution\u2014Jed\u2019s company\u2014held everyone\u2019s money. If Jed offered good security measures, this might prove safer than holding coins on a home computer. But Jed was not a security expert, and if he did somehow lose the private keys to the exchange\u2019s digital wallets, his customers had little recourse. Unlike the banks that Bitcoiners had bashed, Mt. Gox had no deposit insurance and no regulators overseeing the safety and soundness of Jed\u2019s operation. The choice was between security and principles on one hand and convenience on the other.\nFrom DIGITAL GOLD by Nathaniel Popper Copyright \u00a9 2015 by Nathaniel Popper.

On May 29, 2015, he was sentenced to life in prison for his crimes.\nHe was accused of being the owner and operator of the Silk Road website, the most popular online drug marketplace.The indictment charged Ulbricht in seven counts, including narcotics trafficking, narcotics trafficking by means of the Internet, conspiring to commit narcotics trafficking, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiring to commit or aid and abet computer hacking, \u00a0conspiring to traffic in fraudulent identification documents, and conspiring to commit money laundering.\nFilmmaker Alex Winter has written, directed, and produced a film outlining the story of the rise and fall of Silk Road called Deep Web. It premieres on May 31st at 8PM on Epix.\nThe documentary tells the story of the rise and fall of Silk Road, bringing the viewer \u00a0into the world of U.S. law enforcement agencies during their early monitoring\u00a0and seizure of the website, follows Ulbricht\u2019s court case, and documents the present work of one group of people trying to rebuild a decentralized version of the Silk Road.\nIt includes testimonials from government officials, law enforcement, crypto-anarchists, ex-Silk Road vendors, and people who knew Ulbricht personally.\nThe filmmakers provide an impartial recounting of this shocking story while bringing to light important topics of discussion.\u201cI really tried to shine a light on aspects of the story that I wasn\u2019t seeing,\u201d says Winter. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a complex thing to tell a story about for that reason. It\u2019s very easy to paint a story black and white, So a lot of painstaking effort was made to dig into the roots of what these movements are about and examine the grays of what\u2019s seen as a black and white story.\n\u201dThe documentary\u2019s footage of Ulbricht reveals an idealistic, fun-loving, and liberty-minded young American man whose life is paradoxically juxtaposed with that of a\u00a0drug kingpin. His character straddles the line of \u00a0between hero and villain throughout the story.\nCreating such a comprehensive look at this whole story wasn\u2019t without its challenges for the filmmakers.\u201cCreating this film required a fairly comprehensive understanding of the tech,\u201d says Winter. \u00a0\u201cYou also have to have an understanding of the people in the tech communities and get at what their motives are and what they\u2019re trying to accomplish; look at hard truths that may not be palatable to people, \u00a0and just try to paint a human face of the individual convicted of this crime since the counter narrative is so strong; trying to swim against that current is also challenging.\n\u201dBitcoin Magazine spoke to Lyn Ulbricht, Ross Ulbricht\u2019s mother at the SXSW premiere of Deep Web.\n\u201cHe was pretty upset,\u201d said Lyn Ulbricht. \u00a0\u201cIt was very tough on him. The trial was emotionally draining; very hard on all of us. Since then, he really tries to be positive. He\u2019s strong and resilient. He tells me that when he was feeling restless he started working out. He\u2019s coping but it\u2019s tough. He\u2019s very cut off. I\u2019m proud of him. \u201c\u201cThis case is very important,\u201d concluded Lyn Ulbricht. \u00a0\u201cThere's evidence pointing to the fact that the Silk Road server was accessed illegally. It sets precedent going into the digital age that will affect all of us. It\u2019s not just about Ross.\n\u201dNews that two federal agents used their government position for the robbery and extortion of large sums of money from \u00a0the Silk Road has recently surfaced.\nUlbricht\u2019s attorneys filed a motion for a new trial on March 6 on the grounds that the government\u2019s failure to provide \u00a0this exculpatory material in a timely manner denied Ross his fifth amendment right to due process and fair trial.\nNot denying that the criminal case against these former agents alleges corruption, judge Katherine Forrest has denied a retrial for Ulbricht. According to her ruling,\u00a0\u201cThis motion for a new trial\u2026does not address how any additional evidence, investigation, or time would have raised even a remote probability that the outcome of the trial would be any different.\u201dWinter is hoping to bring this story to everyday people and make them think about things that they would\u2019ve otherwise never given thought to.\n\u201cI hope that this project challenges people enough to dig deeper. I hope that people have enough humanity to question things. I hope that it provides impetus for more nuanced discourse about the internet and the movements around the internet that I think are very important.\n\u201dOverall, this gripping documentary demands the viewer's\u2019 attention and contains the staunch realization that we are entering the \u201cfuture\u201d. Along with that comes problems like cyber crime and unknown hacking methods used by both citizens and governments. Some questions to be asked are: Is it safer for drug deals to go on online? \u00a0What are the US citizen's relationship to their government? Is this altering?", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 30}

The list includes two Bitcoin companies that offer simple and effective solutions for important real-world problems.\nBTCjam allows users to invest their bitcoin and earn a high rate of return. This process is secure and allows investors to participate in peer-to-peer lending. BTCjam is also a great place for those seeking loans, and especially for the residents of developing countries without a national credit scoring system who are subject to aggressive predatory lending practices when they need to borrow money from traditional lenders.\nUsing cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, and tapping foreign lenders, helps BTCjam avoid regulatory issues, TechCrunch reported in 2014.\n\u201cWe are one of the first real use cases for bitcoin,\u201d said founder Celso Cardoso Pitta Jr. \u201cToday people circle around buying and selling of bitcoin, but I don\u2019t think bitcoin increases in value because it\u2019s a commodity or a currency. It needs to be useful.\u201d\nBTCjam is a marketplace where people from around the world connect to borrow and lend using bitcoin. By the end of 2014, the company had facilitated bitcoin loans in excess of $10 million dollars in value with more than 100,000 users worldwide. BTCjam created an online credit scoring system to qualify borrowers from all over the world and allow them to build a transparent credit profile on the platform.\n\u201cOur disruptive credit model is providing a new path to financial freedom for users from over 200 countries around the world,\u201d states the BTCjam website. The investors, who loan their money to qualified borrowers, can earn interest up to 19.3 percent. Therefore, the BTCjam solution seems a win-win for both borrowers and investors \u2013 provided, of course, the borrowers repay their loans.\nCredit ratings on BTCJam are determined by many variables. Borrowers can improve their score by having their identity, address, credit score and social accounts verified, and developing a good credit history on BTCJam. The company recently announced its new feature AutoInvest, which automatically diversifies an investment budget into select loans that meet an investor\u2019s selected portfolio criteria and risk preferences.\nEpiphyte (a name that will be familiar to readers of Neal Stephenson\u2019s Cryptonomicon) provides enterprise software solutions for financial service providers to securely integrate with cryptofinancial networks. The company\u2019s software allows financial service providers to convert the currency of one nation to bitcoin, make an international transfer, and change the bitcoin into the currency of the destination country. Epiphyte, a winner of the Innotribe Startup Challenge in October 2015, claims that its software operates well with crypto-financial networks and bridges the traditional financial services with the latest in bitcoin technology.\nEpiphyte\u2019s solution avoids traditional money movement avenues and instead converts currency to bitcoin, moves the coins, then cashes them out on the other end in the local tender. The bitcoin are moved for a fraction of the cost of traditional money transfers using exchanges such as Coinbase and BitPay, which take on the currency risk.\nBanks, for example, will be able to integrate with cryptocurrencies over traditional protocols such as SWIFT. Epiphyte\u2019s first product provides banks with a low-risk way to provide services to their customers. The company is rolling out a pilot implementation of this product.\nThe value proposition of the company is to help banks to provide lower-cost international remittance services by leveraging the innovative solutions provided by Bitcoin startups, which, again, is a win-win for banks and Bitcoin companies, and, of course, for consumers.", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 29}

In fact, MasterCard is using \u201cP2P\u201d in the sense of person-to-person, not peer-to-peer, so the claim seems technically correct. However, MasterCard Send is not P2P in the sense of BitTorrent or Bitcoin.\n\u201cThrough MasterCard Send, we have enabled a breakthrough solution that takes the pain out of the system, provides faster clearing of payments, and delivers a better user experience for senders and receivers alike,\u201d said MasterCard chief emerging payments officer Ed McLaughlin. \u201cMasterCard Send is addressing a real need that exists in today\u2019s digital world to enable consumers, businesses, governments and more to have a safe, simple and secure way to transfer and receive funds quickly.\u201d\nBarb King, a group head in the MasterCard Payment Systems Integrity Group, described the service to PYMNTS as \u201ca breakthrough platform in the industry.\u201d She said that that the service is being marketed to companies and institutions, rather than directly to consumers, and mentioned B2C (business-to-consumer) and G2C (government-to-consumer) use cases. The MasterCard announcement notes that insurance claims, rebates, e-marketplace payouts, social benefits and tax refunds can now be sent in real-time. However, nothing seems to prevent individuals from using the platform to send payments and remittances to other consumers.\nMasterCard Send emulates one of the two main advantages of bitcoin payments \u2013 fast transactions that take minutes instead of days. Details on the business model and economics were not disclosed, so it isn\u2019t clear if MasterCard plans to emulate the other mainstream advantage of bitcoin payments \u2013 cheap transactions.\nThe MasterCard announcement doesn\u2019t mention Bitcoin, but King told PYMNTS that \u201cconsumers are much more comfortable giving their personal details to their financial institution than they are to many other types of entities,\u201d and that is a big reason why she believes MasterCard Send is more appealing than the bitcoin protocol.\nIt\u2019s clear that traditional payment processors won\u2019t let bitcoin payments eat their lunch without a fight. Currently, MasterCard Send seems a strong competitor to centralized operators such as PayPal and Venmo, but not a competitor to peer-to-peer, decentralized bitcoin payments.\nPhoto: Credit card of future / CC BY 2.0", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 21}
{"title": "Nxt: The Original Bitcoin 2.0 Platform With Smart Contracts, Decentralized Crowdfunding, Open Source and 18 Months of Development", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/nxt-original-bitcoin-2-0-platform-smart-contracts-decentralized-crowdfunding-open-source-18-months-development-1432169550/", "birthday": "May 20, 2015  8:52 PM EST", "date": "2015-05-21 01:52:00", "content": "Bitcoin Press Release: With over 18 months of development, The non-profit Nxt Foundation is pleased to announce many disruptive business and financial applications of Nxt\u2019s blockchain technology: including trustless smart contracts, decentralized crowdfunding, a strong open source ethos and more.\nNxt is different. While there are many players in the cryptocurrency 2.0 field, Nxt has several key elements that set it apart from the others.\nFirst and foremost, Nxt is a self-sufficient system. Many other projects depend on a blockchain implemented and maintained by an external party, usually Bitcoin. Nxt is a complete and self-contained system in itself. As any business owner knows, being dependent on a third party for an essential part of their business model introduces unnecessary risk.\nThis is why Nxt chose not to piggyback on an external blockchain over which it has no control, but has built all of its features onto its own blockchain. This also means that Nxt developers can quickly and easily create new features while maintaining a coherent system, without needing to consult with an external blockchain provider.\nSecondly, Nxt has a solid and secure track record. The Nxt blockchain has been in continuous operation and use for 18 months, proving to be a stable system that can scale to handle an increasing load. Additionally, new features have been added on an incremental release basis after thorough evaluation on Nxt\u2019s testnet. Many applications have already been built on top of Nxt, using its diverse features to create decentralised companies and software and to leverage the benefits of its strong community and network.\nThirdly, Nxt is open source and free! Nxt is not under development by a central authority. This may at first appear to be a weakness, but a glance at the extremely successful operating system Linux shows that central development is not needed to create a valuable and working architecture. Nxt has seen fast and dedicated development since its inception and is continuing to evolve with the input of many talented coders. As there is no barrier to entry to the Nxt ecosystem, it is a perfect environment for blue-sky crypto developments.\nJust plug it in\nThe Nxt Cryptocurrency platform is modular by design. Nxt uses a variety of different transaction types that can be combined to perform more complex functions. In order to take full advantage of Nxt\u2019s versatility, its developers have created a plug-in system that allows people to build applications and to share them with other Nxt users.\nThe plug-in system will go live with the release of version 1.5 of the Nxt Reference Software (NRS), Nxt\u2019s native client. This release will also introduce blockchain Voting and Enhanced Multisignature Transactions (Phasing) to the Nxt core functionality. Developers on the Nxt Testnet are already experimenting with use cases, such as a crowdfunding plug-in, an e-commerce plug-in and several others.\nThe plug-in system is an example of the philosophy of flexibility and versatility that is at the heart of Nxt.\nWhat it means for Nxt users\nNxt is eminently suitable for both business and non-commercial use. All of Nxt\u2019s features can be accessed separately or in combination, using a simple but comprehensive API structure.\nNxt is fast, with an average block time of around 90 seconds. It is powerful, giving users access to such diverse features as asset creation and trading, separate currencies, data transfer and storage, blockchain voting and multisignature transactions.\nNxt is easy to build for, and those who want more information about how to use Nxt, or who need support on the more technical aspects of the Nxt systems, can contact the Nxt Foundation.\nThe Nxt Foundation is a non-profit organisation which can answer questions on Nxt, offer support, and connect businesses with the developers and advisors they need to take advantage of the unprecedented opportunities offered by the Nxt platform.

The new stock exchange could sidestep traditional stock exchanges such as NYSE and NASDAQ and issue corporate stock directly over the Internet.\nIn a prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 24, Overstock indicated that it may issue up to $500 million in stock or other securities through an alternative trading system built upon blockchain technology that powers bitcoin. Overstock\u2019s CEO Patrick Byrne is confident that the SEC will approve the filing eventually: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have taken all the time and trouble and expense to do this if I didn\u2019t plan on using it someday soon,\u201d he told Wired.\nNow Wired reveals that last fall Overstock purchased a 25 percent stake in government-regulated trading company PRO Securities. The firm, formed in California in 2002 and now based in New Jersey, manages the buying and selling of securities on behalf of its clients, acting as a registered agent between traders and exchanges. In a government filing earlier this year, PRO Securities amended its charter to say it may handle trades in digital securities overseen by technology related to the \u201cblockchain,\u201d the online public ledger that tracks the movement of bitcoin.\nAccording Byrne, his company has built blockchain-related technology atop the electronic system operated by PRO Securities and is ready to demonstrate this technology to regulators.\n\u201cThe prospect of using a blockchain-like public ledger to hold securities or other assets is quite exciting and one that should be explored,\u201d said Georgetown University professor of finance James Angel. He thinks investors will not immediately adopt new blockchain-based trading systems, preferring instead to continue operating with the traditional systems they are familiar with. However, the inevitable inertia may be overcome if Overstock\u2019s and other similar initiatives gain sufficient momentum.\nIn fact, momentum is building. On May 11, Nasdaq announced that it would begin to leverage the colored coin protocol Open Assets to expand and enhance the equity management capabilities offered by its Nasdaq Private Market platform.\n\u201cUtilizing the blockchain is a natural digital evolution for managing physical securities,\u201d said Nasdaq CEO Bob Greifeld. \u201cOur initial application of Nasdaq\u2019s blockchain technology-enabled offering will modernize, streamline and secure typically cumbersome administrative functions, and will simplify the overwhelming challenges private companies face with manual ledger record-keeping.\u201d\nThis vote of confidence by Nasdaq, a prestigious stock exchange and leading financial institution, is bound to have a deep impact on the acceptance of blockchain-based technologies by the financial mainstream. According to Overstock\u2019s Director of Communications Judd Bagley, the Nasdaq initiative will help in overcoming the hurdle of market acceptance of Medici.\nOther companies expected to play a leading role in developing and deploying blockchain-based security exchanges are Digital Asset Holdings, headed by former JPMorgan superstar Blythe Masters, and Symbiont, a new digital fintech company focused on fostering the symbiotic relationship between traditional financial markets and cryptographic blockchain technology.\nSymbiont was co-founded by the founders of Counterparty, whose technology was initially selected by Overstock as the main software backbone of Medici.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 20}

{"title": "Open Bitcoin Privacy Project Ranks Winners and Losers for Wallet Privacy", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/open-bitcoin-privacy-project-ranks-winners-losers-wallet-privacy-1432168007/", "birthday": "May 20, 2015  8:26 PM EST", "date": "2015-05-21 01:26:00", "content": "The Open Bitcoin Privacy Project (OBPP), has released a report on 10 leading Bitcoin wallets, setting standards for privacy that they argue are much needed in the space. The Bitcoin wallets in the report include Coinbase, Blockchain.info, Mycelium, Darkwallet, Airbitz, Armory, Electrum, Bitcoin Wallet and Multibit Classic.\n\nAccording to the report, Darkwallet is the most privacy-concerned wallet, while Coinbase falls on the other end of the spectrum.\nOBPP is a Bitcoin privacy research organization lead by prominent figures in the Bitcoin community, including Kristov Atlas, a well-known privacy researcher; software designer Justus Ranvier; engineer Daniel Krawisz at Monetas; technical illustrator Samuel Peterson, and others.\nThe researchers looked at various aspects of wallet software, including where public addresses are generated, whether clients (such as light wallets) need to ask trusted servers for the balance of their accounts, whether users are protected from blockchain observers through the use of coin mixers or stealth addresses.\nAll off the test results added up to three categories of testing: usability, quality and feedback. These three add up for a total privacy score of up to 100 points. All wallet providers were sent a questionnaire and given a chance to review the research results before publishing. Almost half of the wallet developers did not respond to the questionnaire.\nThe three lowest ranked wallets for privacy: Coinbase, Multibit, Blockchain.info,\nCoinbase is a leading U.S. Bitcoin company that provides exchange and payment processing services as well as wallet services. Both of these wallets provide custodial services to users and keep control over their private keys, with the exception of Coinbase Vault\u2019s support for multi-signature wallets. OBPP focused on the classic version, which keeps full control over their user\u2019s private keys. It did not fare well under their tests.\n\u201cBecause of the custodial nature of Coinbase\u2019s wallet, users are afforded low privacy. Private keys are generated and held server-side, and the service retains detailed information about incoming and outgoing transactions. Customers must undergo a stringent identification process in order to use the service. The wallet generates new Bitcoin addresses for change, but employs few other basic controls to protect privacy on the blockchain,\u201d said the authors of the OBPP report.\nThe authors also point out that Coinbase can improve these privacy vulnerabilities and remain compliant with anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer rules by discouraging address reuse and providing better feedback to users about actions that will degrade their privacy.\nThe Coinbase wallet scored only 11 out of 100 possible points for privacy. Only a few points above Coinbase was the Blockchain.info wallet. Blockchain.info is one of the oldest companies in the Bitcoin wallet space and were the first to advocate full user control over private keys, a standard that set the bar for all wallet providers.\nAs early leaders in the Bitcoin wallet race, their web and mobile wallets quickly became the most widely used, with nearly 3.4 million wallets in existence, according to OBPP.\nWhile Blockchain.info has made efforts toward improving user privacy, including the launch of their CoinJoin bitcoin mixing technology, they have fallen behind by not implementing hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets. This generally means that users must manually create new addresses for each transaction for maximum privacy and continuously update their backups, instead of new addresses being automatically generate for each transaction from a common seed.\nAccording to the OBPP report, Blockchain.info\u2019s web and mobile wallets function so differently that they analyzed each individually, and they received scores of 22 and 14 out of 100 respectively, leaving them at above only Coinbase in the rankings.\nKristov Atlas told Bitcoin Magazine that \u201cThe single biggest differentiator for the spring 2015 rankings was whether the wallet was [hierarchical deterministic]\u201d\nFirst place: Darkwallet\nAt the top of the rankings is Darkwallet, a Google Chrome extension wallet. Darkwallet made international headlines over the past two years as an anonymity and anti-surveillance software initiative founded by activists Amir Taaki and Cody Wilson. Its objective is to make Bitcoin finance \u201cgo dark.\u201d\nThe Darkwallet project has been noticeably absent from the media in the past months but the development build of the wallet put it at the lead as far as total privacy with a score of 54.\n\u201cDarkwallet in the only wallet we\u2019ve considered so far which includes automatic CoinJoin mixing and ECDH stealth addresses. Another notable feature in Darkwallet is an automatic P2P network for messaging between users,\u201d according to the OBPP report.\nDarkwallet is indeed the only major Bitcoin wallet with stealth addresses (SA) natively supported for recipients and senders. Some wallets, such as Electrum, support sending, but not receiving, SA transactions. Because of the nature of SA, it is essential that other wallets support the technology to enhance its utility and standardization.\nTwo of the weaknesses of Darkwallet were its dependence on \u201cObelisk servers which have the ability to de-anonymize users,\u201d coupled with low user activity, which makes it much harder to find others to mix up your transactions with, particularly with significant amounts of bitcoin.\nSince Darkwallet is still in alpha development, future growth of the user base could alleviate the liquidity problems of their mixing process. Nevertheless, the OBPP researchers expressed uncertainty about the future of the project given that has not released a stable build yet and no development activity has occurred since February 2015. The Darkwallet developers did not respond to the OBPP questionnaire.\nDesktop wallets: Armory, Electrum, Multibit\nTaking second-place in overall privacy ranking is Armory, the full-node Bitcoin vault that provides wallet security software for the intermediate and advanced Bitcoin users and enterprise customers. Armory is available for Linux, Windows and OSX and is among the more resource-intensive wallets, in part because it\u2019s designed to run a full bitcoin node. It had a total privacy score of 54, tying it for first place with Darkwallet.\nArmory was praised for supporting with hierarchical deterministic (HD) address generation and not reusing addresses by default, as well as supporting TOR connections with minimal configuration.\nThe researchers suggest that Armory can improve privacy protections for users by supporting a mixing protocol such as CoinJoin as well as by informing users when they are making choices that compromise their privacy, a common criticism leveled at most the wallets included in the report.\nElectrum followed the desktop wallets with a score of 46, tying it for fifth place with the mobile Bitcoin Wallet. It earned that ranking for its support of HD addresses, using a 12-word seed for a one-time backup, as well as its default generation of new addresses per transaction. But most noticeably, Electrum was praised for being included in the privacy-centric Tails operating system, as well as its easy compatibility with TOR connections.\nElectrum\u2019s largest weakness, according to OBPP, was its reliance in a federated network of Electrum servers which connect it to the Bitcoin network. The researcher suggest Electrum could improve its score by adding support for stealth addresses and CoinJoin.\nThe most private mobile wallets: Mycelium, Bitcoin Wallet, Electrum, AirBitz\nTaking third place with a score of 50 was Mycelium, the Android and iOS Bitcoin wallet which regularly earns praise for its privacy features. Mycelium ranked highly for its use of HD wallets and its easy support for TOR connections.\nHowever, it was criticized for relying on the Mycelium servers rather than Bitcoin peers to connect to the Bitcoin network. This weakness, they argue, allows the company to gather information on users. This weakness was common among most Bitcoin wallets, except those running a full node, such as Armory.\nFollowing Mycelium were Bitcoin Wallet, Electrum and Airbitz, all with scores of 45 or 46 out of 100.\nThese mid-ranked wallets generally suffered from the same weaknesses: reliance on central servers to connect to the Bitcoin network, no support of stealth addresses, and no graphic user interface warnings informing users about choices that compromise their privacy. Among the four mobile wallets, only Mycelium and Airbitz responded to the questionnaire provided by the OBPP.\nInterested parties can read the full report here and contribute to the OBPP efforts at their website.", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 21}

The release is tagged alpha 0.1.0, which makes it clear that it isn\u2019t yet stable or full-featured. However, the roadmap is nothing short of revolutionary and could have a significant impact.\n\u201cBitnation is a Governance 2.0 Operating System, designed to disrupt the nation-state oligopoly through offering more convenient, secure and cost-efficient governance services,\u201d Tarkowski Tempelhof, a Swedish thinker and activist who spent years working as a contractor in various conflict zones , told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cAs the world progressively moves away from the current geographical nation state paradigm due to globalization, it leaves room for a brand new solution to rise from its ashes, one where governance service providers compete through offering better services, rather than through maintaining a geographical monopoly using violence.\u201d\nBitnation Pangea wants to be the world\u2019s first blockchain powered Virtual Nation, able to provide all services that traditional governments provide and replace the nation state system with a voluntary form of governance. Bitnation\u2019s ultimate aim is to create a new world where everyone can choose the nation they prefer, several nations, or none at all, and even create their own nation on the Bitnation platform.\n\u201cThe alternative the world is currently pivoting towards is U.N.-style global organizations, which would be an even worse \u2018one-fit-all\u2019 type governance model than what we currently have,\u201d says Tarkowski Tempelhof. \u201cBitnation aims to prevent that, through setting a precedent for voluntary competing service providers, powered by the Bitcoin blockchain technology, effectively creating an open source cryptonation protocol.\u201d\nThe backbone of the platform consists of the ID and Reputation System (The Bitnation Passport), the Dispute Resolution System, the Public Notary and a DIY Governance (D)App Library where others can create, upload, share or sell their own Governance (D)Apps. Planned services include marriage, wills, childcare contracts, birth certificates, land titles, corporate incorporation and equity trade, unemployment insurance, pensions, health care insurance, security and diplomacy.\nThe alpha release, which is updated in realtime in response to user feedback on the Bitnation discussion groups, already includes some interesting features, such as the possibility to register and timestamp a document on the blockchain.\nPrevious Bitnation pathfinders and proofs of concept include the first marriage registered on the blockchain and the first blockchain passport. Bitnation also developed and tested workable DIY land titles recorded on the blockchain in Ghana, where 70 percent of land lacks proper titles, preventing investing in and borrowing against land.\nBitnation, after surveying many blockchain-based protocols, has teamed up with Horizon and Blocknet to develop the first implementation of Pangea. While the Horizon blockchain is used in the alpha release, Blocknet technology will enable Pangea to support other blockchains. According to Tarkowski Tempelhof, future releases of Pangea will not be limited to altcoins but able to use the Bitcoin blockchain itself, which bids well for the future of the project.\n\u201cBitnation is a groundbreaking concept, and we\u2019re very excited to provide a platform for it to be developed upon,\u201d said Blocknet core team member Arlyn Culwick. \u201cWe believe that the Blocknet, by enabling open ended inter-chain services, unlocks the full potential of blockchain-based technology.\u201d\n\u201cBitnation is a revolutionary idea, an idea which we believe will radically change the world for the better,\u201d said Tarkowski Tempelhof in a previous press release. \u201cHowever, being the first in the world to challenge the nation-state construct head-on through providing better services using blockchain technology, it is not always easy to implement.\u201d\nOf course, one of the main challenges is funding. Therefore the Bitnation team, which so far has mostly relied on volunteers, is looking for a moderate amount of angel funding to put its operations on more solid ground.", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 20}

The International Money Transfer Conference (IMTC) will hold the Blockchain and Remittance Day during their event in Istanbul on May 25th.\nThe one-day event will be part of a larger conference about remittances in the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Attendees range from executives of large remittance companies to industry analysts to founders of money transfer startups. The special blockchain event is meant to introduce a \u201crange of practical subjects\u201d about new money transfer systems built on top of Ripple and Bitcoin that could be used for remittances.\nMuch talk has surrounded the enormous potential of blockchain protocols as money transfer and remittances tools even though there were no concrete examples to show, the conference\u2019s website notes. \u201cThat has changed in 2015.

Long says users are \u201cable to sell their remaining contract time on the Mintsy marketplace where other folks may want a shorter contract and can bid on contracts that are up for sale by the user.\u201d\nMining the Future\nAt the time of this post, Mintsy is made up of 20 people, and is the result of a joint venture between Terraboss Inc. and digitalBTC. The development team is spread out between the United States and London, while the majority of the accounting takes place in Australia. DigitalBTC is an Australian company that is publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange under the ticker DCC.\nWith a bitcoin mining pool going strong at more than 5 PH/s, Mintsy offers SHA-256 and Scrypt contracts ranging with flexible three-month and six-month contracts, although \u201cmore exotic algorithm contracts will be online soon.\u201d\n\nThinking Outside The Box: Cryptographic Proof of Hashrate\nLong, a serial entrepreneur in the fields of Bitcoin, drones and manufacturing, explains that previously, many cloud-based mining services \u201cgot away with lots of bitcoin in the beginning because nobody demanded proof of what they were selling.\u201d\nHe explains that Mintsy will circumvent all of the problems relating to the auditing that their accounting staff may have to deal with, since all of their hashrate information will be transparent.\nNaysayers are given proof that the cloud mining company is not double-selling hashrates, instead running a 100 percent full reserve by having all of their information accessible on the blockchain. Long has been working with Bitcoin core developer Peter Todd to implement the cryptographic proof-of-hashrate for Mintsy. This feature is still in development with a planned release in mid- June.\nAnother feature that Mintsy will have is the ability for users to use the website\u2019s service and rent out their rigs to other users for a fee, much like Betarigs.\nIn the meantime, users can limit their luck variance by allowing their customer base to \u201ctake their contract and point it to any pool.\u201d When users don\u2019t put all of their eggs in one basket, the choice in picking their mining pools is \u201cnot only transparent, it\u2019s more efficient since your [one] pool is not lucky all the time.\u201d\nBut is Cloud Mining still profitable?\nIt\u2019s no surprise that conventional mining is not as easy as it used to be.\n\u201cIf your electricity bill is very high, then there is no way you can make money mining even with the most advanced of chips,\u201d explains Marshall. To him, cloud mining not only helps those who don\u2019t have access to cheap power, but also provides new users with a way to ease into mining for a very small fee. The company\u2019s smallest contract costs a little under $20, and users can always trade contracts on the Mintsy marketplace.", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 21}

Author Mike Orcutt notes that not everyone in the community of users of the Bitcoin software \u2013 which includes miners, developers, and a growing number of startups \u2013 agrees that Andresen\u2019s proposal is the best path forward.\nFor example, some critics argue that Andresen\u2019s solution could lead to a dangerous \u201ccentralization\u201d within the mining community, which would favor bigger, richer mining operations. A counter-argument is that it\u2019s already too late: Bitcoin mining is already centralized and dominated by large, professional mining operations, and totally out of reach of individual miners and grassroots pools. This debate reflects the tension between two increasingly conflicting aspects of Bitcoin \u2013 the DIY, grassroots spirit of the early adopters, and the mainstream need for much more streamlined and efficient operations.\nOther critics, including Bitcoin core developer Pieter Wuille, argue that right now there are just too many unknowns about the consequences of increasing the block size to 20 megabytes. Wuille hints at \u201cthings we don\u2019t even know of that could break,\u201d and says that a smaller increase at first would be less risky.\nAs for all important choices in technology development, there is no clear-cut ideal solution that fits all needs. On the contrary, different requirements must be prioritized and an optimal trade-off must be found. An interesting issue is who gets to make the decision. Princeton computer science professor Arvind Narayanan observes that the core developers are the only ones with the power to change the code, and therefore they will probably make the decision themselves if they can reach consensus \u2013 which is not the case at the moment, since at least one of them is against the proposed hard fork.\nThe global issue is governance and leadership in Bitcoin technical development, which has been mostly \u201cleaderless\u201d as the title of the MIT Technology Reviewarticle emphasizes, with the Bitcoin Foundation unable to provide effective governance. Recently, Andresen and other Bitcoin Core developers joined the MIT Digital Currency Initiative, which is now beginning to assume leadership in the Bitcoin development space.\nBrian Forde, director of the MIT Digital Currency Initiative, is offering to co-host an open forum for discussions aimed arriving at a rough consensus, The Wall Street Journal reports. \u201cHow this decision is made will be a good example of how the open and active community of developers, entrepreneurs, miners, researchers and users will continue to collaborate on major changes to Bitcoin core,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto background by Freepik.", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 21}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nElliptic and Gem have announced a new partnership today that will involve Elliptic acting as a trusted and independent third party for the purposes of securely storing the third (backup) private key used on the Gem platform. In the past, multisig wallet users have been in control of their own backup private keys, but this new offering from Gem and Elliptic could offer a higher level of security for individuals who do not wish to take care of their own backup solutions. Up to this point, Elliptic has been an insured bitcoin storage provider for a variety of banks and exchanges who need to protect their private keys, so choosing them as the custodians of backup keys for multisig wallets seems like a wise move by Gem.\nAn explanation of the third key\nOver the past year or two, it has become clear that multisig wallets are the wave of the future. Gem CEO Micah Winkelspecht clearly understands this point, which is why his company has been working to allow developers to create the most secure multisig wallets via Gem\u2019s API. With this new setup involving Elliptic, Gem will not be in control of more than one private key. Instead, one private key each will be held by the user, Gem and Elliptic. Both Gem and Elliptic believe this solution provides a higher level of security than the traditional multi-signature wallets created through a single provider.\nInsured third-key storage\nPerhaps the most unique feature of Elliptic as a third-key custodian is the fact that they\u2019re able to offer insurance against unauthorized use of that third key. When clarifying exactly what this insurance policy covers, Elliptic Analyst Nathan Jessop told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cWe are insured against losses due to unauthorized use of the third, backup key that we hold \u2013 this covers both criminal and accidental loss.\u201d\nWhen speaking to the importance of insurance for the third key in a multi-signature wallet, Elliptic CEO Dr. James Smith explained:\n\u201cAt Elliptic, our focus is on bringing bitcoin to the enterprise by developing secure and convenient products and processes. By combining Gem\u2019s API platform with our insured and accredited key storage service, a new bar has been set for multi-signature wallet security and usability.\u201d\nA new standard for multisig wallets?\nIt\u2019s clear that both Gem and Elliptic believe this is a huge leap forward for multi-signature wallets and bitcoin in general. As Gem\u2019s Winkelspecht noted:\n\u201cNow clients can rest easy knowing that even if they lose their private key, they can rely on two independent parties to secure their assets. Elliptic is the most trusted name in private key storage and our tight integration means that there is no single point of failure for Gem\u2019s multi-signature wallets.\u201d\nElliptic\u2019s Jessop agrees with Winkelspecht\u2019s assessment of the new partnership, and he also added:\n\u201cI believe this model will become more common, although it\u2019s important to point out that it\u2019s not just about the multisig scheme \u2013 the security and controls of the parties holding keys are still important. Elliptic combines insurance with accreditation by KPMG to the same standards as a custodian bank.\u201d\nIn the future, Elliptic also plans to provide this sort of private key storage for alternative assets that are tracked via the blockchain. Over the long term, Jessop noted that the company plans to focus on secure storage, asset transfer and an auditable chain of ownership. Jessop also mentioned that the combination of their accreditation from KPMG with their insurance offering has led to \u201csignificant institutional interest.\u201d\nPhoto: DSC02405 / CC BY 2.0", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 21}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nThe launch of Streamium was announced via Reddit yesterday.\nThe new application from Manuel Ar\u00e1oz and company was created to build a direct connection between video streamers and their viewers. Video streaming is dealt with on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis via WebRTC, and payments for viewing a stream are made possible through the use of bitcoin and payment channels.\nA stream of small, off-chain payments are made to the broadcaster every second as the viewer continues to watch a stream, and all of those micropayments are then combined into one larger payment that is made via the bitcoin blockchain.\nThe P2P nature of the Streamium platform has the potential to disrupt many different types of video streaming businesses currently found on the Internet due to the fact that it is now much easier to broadcast directly to an audience rather than going through a middleman.\nStill, there is still plenty of work to be done when it comes to scaling the software up to handle larger audiences. For now, a broadcaster is limited by his or her own available bandwidth. In any case, here are five types of people who could benefit from trying out Streamium for the first time.\nCam Girls\nThe most obvious area where Streamium can be helpful is in the adult entertainment industry, especially when it comes to live cam shows. The adult industry has faced financial censorship from both PayPal and the legacy banking system, which is why many adult entertainment sites have turned to the blockchain for payments.\nLive cam sites can sometimes take a large percentage of a performer\u2019s profits, which is why the direct payment from the audience to the entertainer on Streamium could be rather helpful. Of course, it would also make sense if the viewers were able to also tip performers for certain requests.\nLive Sports Pirates\nBitcoin isn\u2019t necessarily entirely about illegal activity, but those sorts of profit opportunities seem to be where new technologies take off first. Most sports fans are familiar with free online streams that are usually hosted by shady individuals at a rather low resolution.\nViewers are usually bombarded with advertisements when viewing these unlicensed streams, and it also feels like viruses and malware are right around the corner on these kinds of sites. Due to the P2P nature of Streamium, new streaming sports pirates may decide to offer a premium version of sporting events in higher quality without all of the downsides currently found in the black market industry.\nDoctors, Lawyers, and Other On-Demand Professionals\nA variety of \u201cprofessional-on-demand\u201d services have popped up over the past few years. These are the kinds of websites or apps where you\u2019re able to talk to a doctor (Doctor on Demand), lawyer (LAWfone) or some other professional for a flat fee.\nAlthough these services were a move in the right direction when it comes to cutting costs, they aren\u2019t completely necessary in a world of Streamium and social media. Closely associated with this sort of 1-on-1 streaming activity is also the ability to be a freelance consultant on basically any topic without a middleman. Of course, it should be remembered middlemen still have value in these sorts of freelance operations for marketing purposes.\nProfessional Gamers and Gaming Personalities\nThe magnitude of online video game streaming may not have become apparent to the general public until Twitch was bought by Amazon for nearly $1 billion, but the large number of young people turning to the video game streaming platform for full-time employment is now becoming hard to ignore. Professional gamers and gaming personalities could use Streamium in a few different ways to improve their overall profits.\nAlthough completely replacing Twitch may not be in the cards, streamers could turn to Streamium as a vehicle for pay-per-view events. Whether it is two famous CS:GO teams playing a friendly game or a training session with one of the best StarCraft players in the world, there are a variety of ways in which pro gamers can use Streamium to their advantage.\nTeachers\nPrivate teachers already exist, but what if those teachers were also able to livestream their lectures to outsiders at a fixed rate?\n\u201cTeacher\u201d is also used as a rather broad term here as it could be anyone who is able to explain a specific topic to someone else. For example, well-known bitcoin evangelist Andreas Antonopoulos could start a class that can be viewed by anyone via Streamium. Perhaps there would also be a small fee for asking a question at the end of a lecture or presentation.\nStreamium could allow new students to attend a class without doing anything else besides showing up and opening a payment channel (assuming that they already have some bitcoin.) Perhaps the platform would also be useful for 1-on-1 tutoring sessions between students.\nLong Story Short\nIn reality, no one really knows how people are going to end up using this new platform. Like many other innovative applications, it is up to the users to figure out how to best use this new tool. Perhaps we\u2019ll see bitcoin conferences or video podcasts on Streamium in the future, but the team behind this new project will need to figure out how to scale the technology \u2013 perhaps through webtorrent \u2013 before there are any mass events streamed with it.", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 22}

Written as an introduction for financial professionals and busy investors with little previous knowledge of Bitcoin, the report gives far too much space to marginal aspects such as price swings, scams and bankruptcies. However, while the depth of the analysis doesn\u2019t match that of recent reports by Goldman Sachs and other top financial institutions, the Bloomberg report offers interesting insights and opinions that highlight current trends and issues in the Bitcoin space.\nBarry Silbert, founder and CEO of the Digital Currency Group and creator of the Bitcoin Investment Trust, the first Bitcoin investment vehicle publicly traded in the United States, focuses on the price of bitcoin and hopes it will increase. \u201cPeople will get excited about bitcoin when they believe its price will rise, which will create a flywheel effect of increased adoption, velocity, trading, etc.,\u201d he says. \u201cBitcoin can live up to its promise, but it will only be possible if the price and liquidity are a lot higher than they are today.\u201d\nTaking the opposite view is Stony Brook University finance professor and Bloomberg columnist Noah Smith, who is persuaded that bitcoin becomes more useful as a currency the more its price drops. Currencies and investment vehicles like stocks and gold are very different, and Smith considers the currency aspects of bitcoin as more promising and important than the investment aspects.\n\u201cThe sooner people give up the hope that bitcoin will skyrocket in price, the sooner they will be willing to spend bitcoins in everyday life, the way they now spend dollars,\u201d he says, and adds that the quicker bitcoin as an investment dies, the quicker bitcoin as currency can come to life.\nJerry Brito, Executive Director of Coin Center, argues that utility will be the best barometer of success. As examples of useful applications, he mentions both new applications to micropayments and the Internet of Things (IoT) and new, cheaper and more agile business models for existing applications.\nRon Hose, co-founder and CEO of Philippines-headquartered Coins.ph, focuses on the impact of cheap and efficient bitcoin remittances.\n\u201cThink of how Skype lowered the cost of calling overseas a decade ago,\u201d he says. \u201cBitcoin can have the same effect on the remittance market.\u201c\nGil Luria, managing director for financial technology research at Wedbush Securities, mentions cross-border remittances and micropayments as \u201cobvious places where the [bitcoin] technology can radically reduce friction,\u201d and notes that the provision of banking-like services to underbanked populations around the world is likely to have a high impact.\nHowever, Luria thinks that Bitcoin is still a research area, and not ready yet for widespread operational use in mainstream finance.

In fact, its founding predated the March 18, 2013 FinCEN guidance which applied Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) regulations to digital currency exchanges and administrators by defining them as money transmitters, a type of money services business (MSB). As detailed in the settlement agreement, Ripple Labs did not immediately register its already existing business with FinCEN when the guidance was issued. Rather, they ultimately registered a subsidiary later that same year. Thus, the company operated an unregistered money services business (MSB). Simply put, this is one of the easiest violations for a regulator to prove. It is perhaps the lowest of the proverbial low hanging fruit.\nBoth prior and subsequent to registering as an MSB, regulators determined that Ripple Labs did not implement an effective BSA/AML program. (Note the italicized text added for emphasis.) Lest one think they can simply delay BSA/AML compliance by postponing FinCEN MSB registration, regulators reminded digital currency entities in the settlement agreement that \u201c\u2026regardless of whether they have registered, as required, MSBs are subject to certain additional requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act and its implementing regulations.\u201d So bottom line\u2026if you\u2019re operational, you must have an effective BSA/AML program already in place. Waiting until you reach some predetermined company milestone before building out compliance functionality is not only a regulatory violation, as FinCEN and the US DOJ proved, but a very costly business strategy.\nEqually damning is the idea of cobbling together bits and pieces of your compliance program as you grow. Digital currency exchanges and administrators must be strategic and very deliberate about investments in the area of compliance. While it\u2019s a tall order to be sure, especially for a startup or small venture, the single best approach is to lay the foundation of your program using the \u201cfour pillars\u201d of BSA/AML compliance (1. Designation of a Compliance Officer; 2. Development of internal policies, procedures and controls; 3. Ongoing, relevant training of employees; and, 4. Independent testing and review). With few exceptions, any investments you make in the area of compliance will fall into one or more of these four buckets. The importance of developing and investing in the vitality of the four pillars cannot be understated. Within the settlement itself, regulators took the opportunity to remind digital currency exchanges and administrators that they are required to implement an AML program that, at minimum, contains each of the four pillars. While investments in compliance \u2013 a non-revenue generating function of one\u2019s business \u2013 may seem costly, the cost of not developing and effectively implementing a strategic approach from day one is exponentially higher.\nRecall earlier in this article, I alluded to the $1.1 million aggregate fine as only the beginning of the true cost. Now the real work begins! In \u201cAttachment B: Remedial Framework\u201d, the settlement agreement provides a detailed list of cumbersome, time-sensitive requirements and deliverables that must be turned over on an extremely tight schedule. Among these, Ripple Labs must create and implement a training program; secure an independent party to review its AML program; enhance its protocol; implement transaction monitoring systems; and, perform a \u201clook back\u201d for potential suspicious activity. Further, not captured in the resource cost of remediating these items is the potential loss of revenue from new or existing customers that may question their faith in the company or losses attributable to engaging regulators rather than the marketplace. Moreover, business will now be conducted on the regulator\u2019s terms, not the company\u2019s terms. As you may well grasp from the partial list of required remedial fixes and indirect costs, the monetary penalty is only the beginning of the financial and operational pain.\nThe news, however, is not all bad. In fact, regulators devoted several detailed sentences at the very beginning of the settlement agreement to applauding Ripple Labs\u2019 cooperation and commitment to maintaining an effective AML program. This was not by accident, nor should it be overlooked. When determining monetary fines and other forfeitures, regulators generally take into consideration the level of cooperation; self-disclosures made upfront; and, past violations, if any. The acknowledgement of these proactive efforts was just as much a call to shape future interactions with other digital currency exchanges and administrators, as it was a recognition of Ripple Labs\u2019 progress and initiative.\nSummary\nThe settlement agreement between regulators and Ripple Labs, the first civil enforcement action against any digital currency exchange, offers a valuable learning opportunity. The speed of innovation and marketplace disruption have never met a countering forcing quite like financial regulation. Digital currency exchanges and administrators have had to make changes while in motion. Some have been forced to suspend services (temporarily or indefinitely), while others still have struggled to adapt to a system of regulation that never really seems to fit quite right. Regardless of your past experiences or current circumstances, regulation is here to stay. The Ripple Labs settlement illustrates the importance of executing a comprehensive and cohesive AML compliance strategy that begins on day one of operations. It also teaches us that proactively mending previous regulatory transgressions, owning up to compliance faults, and pursuing a course of action to make thing right can soften the blow. So, if you haven\u2019t already begun to invest time and resources into the build out of your AML compliance program, today is the day to get started. For those that have begun, it\u2019s imperative that you move forward by staying on top of developments in the compliance world and never look back.\nThe Ripple Labs settlement must be embraced as a learning opportunity. It\u2019s just a shame that this promising venture will be held back from advancing the pace of innovation in our industry due to early AML compliance missteps.\nLearn more about Joe Ciccolo, CEO of BitAML at his DCC Member Profile.", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 23}

The liquids vaporized from the chips are condensed and reused.\nAccording to a report, the U.S National Security Agency\u2019s major data center in Utah \u201cconsumes up to 6.6 million gallons of water a month.\u201d Apart from the water used to cool the data center, it also embeds water in electricity generation which consumes 1.8 liters of water per kilowatt-hour in the United States.\nAllied Control\u2019s third-generation immersion cooling system saves around 99 percent of electricity used for cooling not just in cold regions, but hot and humid parts in Asia, without wasting water or oil. This advantage allows data centers and chip manufacturers to expand their services into countries with cheap power costs and existing infrastructure, such as the Philippines or Vietnam.\nIn January 2015, Bitfury acquired Allied Contol for the same reason, with a global vision to expand throughout Asia into countries with low power costs for manufacturing chips for bitcoin mining.\n\u201cThis acquisition will enable us to substantially increase energy efficiency of our data centers and speed up deployment of our new ASIC chip allowing to lower overall capital expenditure,\u201d BitFury CEO Valery Vavilov said. \u201cIn addition, it provides an opportunity for us to enter new markets such as HPC, using the experience of the Allied Control team. The use of immersion cooling will provide BitFury with flexibility when choosing locations for our data centers.\u201d\nHelp Datacenters in Locations like California\nSuffering from the same problem as the massive data center in Utah, several major technology companies have moved their data centers from California to other colder states due to high energy and water consumption. However, with the two-phase immersion cooling system, tech giants have the opportunity to move to regions such as California, where infrastructures are pre-set-up and most tech talents are based.\n\u201cWith California being in its fourth consecutive drought year and regulators proposing mandatory reduction of up to 35 percent in urban water consumption, Allied Control\u2019s immersion cooling technology might offer an effective solution to cool down the many data centers serving the hungry and ever-growing demand of cloud services and other Silicon Valley applications,\u201d said Kar-Wing Lau, vice president of operations at Allied Control, in a press release. \u201cIn our standard configuration, the closed-loop cooling units do not use evaporative water towers, and as a result, the water usage effectiveness is close to zero (WUE <0.003 L/kWh).\n\u201cOur proprietary technology is highly energy efficient,\u201d added Vavilov. \u201cWe are committed to growing our transaction processing infrastructure with the smallest carbon footprint, continuing to rely solely on renewable energy sources.\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 26}

GoldMoney, since its founding in 2001, has amassed 20,000 customers, 135,000 user sign ups and manages more than $1 billion in assets.\nIn a BitGold press release, the startup said the acquisition will lower its operating cost and give them a ready-made vault storage operation for the company's in-beta gold payment system. BitGold is currently developing and testing a payment service that will use blockchain technology to facilitate digital gold payments.\nAs part of the acquisition, GoldMoney founder James Turk, alongside company directors Mahendra Naik and Hector Fleming, will join BitGold\u2019s board of directors.\n\u201cWe created GoldMoney with the vision of making gold accessible for savings and payments, a vision that BitGold is rapidly expanding in a new era of cloud computing and mobile technology,\u201d said Turk.Roy Sebag, BitGold CEO added, \u201cwith the technology of the BitGold platform we can expand the GoldMoney legacy of trust, security and a client-centric purpose to new markets, growing from a much stronger base and benefiting all stakeholders. Combining the first global e-marketplace for gold with the latest and most innovative, we instantly become the world\u2019s largest and most active bullion money service.\u201d\n\nGold 2.0?\n\u201dHowever, BitGold was very hush-hush about how -- and if -- the blockchain startup\u2019s payment network would be implemented into GoldMoney. Additionally, since the company is so new there do not appear to be many people who have written a Bitgold review.\nFounded in 2014, BitGold launched with the mission to make gold payments practical by digitizing them through Bitcoin\u2019s payment network. Since then, the startup has received a lot of attention, as well as investment. The gold payment network has raised several million dollars from large players in the gold and financial industries, including Alex and Gregory Soros\u2019 fund, Soros Brothers Investments, and Eric Sprott\u2019s Sprott Inc.\nDespite the attention and lack of many serious Bitgold review, the company has been secretive about the company\u2019s product, which has been loosely described as a payment network for gold using the blockchain (though recently all mentions of blockchain and bitcoin have been removed from BitGold\u2019s marketing copy). BitGold launched a private beta for select persons in Zurich, London, Hong Kong and several other cities late last year. The beta was supposed to end in early February, but has continued. The product is still unavailable to the public.According to a video produced by the startup, the payment network will serve three main use cases: greater gold functionality for gold investors, online payments and international money transfers (remittances).\nIn the video, Sebag said users will be able to send gold to any other BitGold user for free, no matter where that user is (after an initial cost of one percent to get the gold into the network). The founders of the company envision a future where migrants would avoid fees charged by remittance providers by sending gold through the startup.It is unclear how a BitGold review would deal with compliance requirements for operating a global payment system. The startup has failed to shed any light so far on how BitGold will comply with know-your-customer (KYC) regulations around the world. That is a huge question, since every single \u201cdigital gold\u201d company that has come before BitGold has either been charged by law enforcement or shut down on its onw volition due to financial regulations.\nUp until 2012, GoldMoney ran its own gold payment service that allowed users to send gold to each other. But the company shut it down citing the regulatory costs of compliance as too high for the \"insignificant demand.\u201d Also, in contrast to the now defunct E-Gold, whose founders were arrested, GoldMoney\u2019s digital gold network did not allow for independent agents to exchange the virtual gold for real gold. The tactic heavily limited the product\u2019s potential but helped it avoid being a den of black market activity that E-Gold became.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 26}

The Bitcoin policy think tank Coin Center expressed similar concerns.\nThe Wall Street Journalnotes that Lawsky\u2019s rules, likely to be released next week, could hinder innovation among small tech startups with limited resources by imposing too-high compliance costs.\nIn particular, according to the MIT Digital Currency Initiative analysis, Bitcoin companies would be required to get both a money transmitter license and a BitLicense \u2014 even though the two licenses have substantial overlapping requirements. Furthermore, compliance with BitLicense would be required for operations that don\u2019t control customers\u2019 funds, and even for software development work.\nThe Cato Institute, a public policy research organization with a libertarian orientation, bluntly denounces Lawsky\u2019s move.\n\u201c[If] history is any guide, Ben Lawsky will be able to use the name he made attacking Bitcoin to wend his way into the Bitcoin business world,\u201d notes Cato Senior Fellow Tim Harper. \u201cBecause of the contacts he made as a regulator, he can hire himself out to Bitcoin companies wanting to signal to other regulators that they have the approval of the regulatory establishment.\u201d\nAccording to Harper, Lawsky\u2019s office violated New York\u2019s Freedom of Information Law by refusing to release the research and analysis that it claimed to have done to validate the BitLicense regulation, and framed the regulatory discussion in a way that other regulators have felt obliged to copy.\nWithout speculating on whether Cato\u2019s concerns are applicable in this specific case, it is worth noting that it wouldn\u2019t be the first time that artificial, unnecessary strict restrictions and barriers to new businesses are put in place by regulators who hope to cash in later by helping struggling firms work around their own regulations.\nIn his commentary to the proposed BitLicense, Harper argues that poorly formed government regulation that impedes Bitcoin\u2019s adoption will thwart badly needed global economic progress.\n\u201cThe \u2018BitLicense\u2019 proposal does not meet those high standards,\u201d says Harper. \u201cThe evidence that it will produce net benefits is weak, and the likelihood that it will have greater costs than benefits is high.\u201d\nThe Cato Institute suggests that the Bitcoin community should refuse to do business with firms that hire Lawsky as a consultant or adviser, and hold regulators to account even after they\u2019ve left office to make sure that regulators don\u2019t thwart financial innovation hoping to profit after they leave office.", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 23}

The Greek government could use blockchain technology to create a digital currency backed by Greece\u2019s 86 billion euros in illiquid assets.\nThe government of Greece would place a portion of its assets into a trust, and create a digital currency backed by this basket of assets. The digital currency could then be used to repay creditors and pay government employees. Initial proceeds from the sale of the currency could be used to meet obligations to the European Union, while government employees could be paid in this parallel currency.According to a Reuters report, the European Central Bank is working on an IOU-based secondary currency similar to the IOU's used by California in 2009. Kelly notes that Greece\u2019s Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis wrote a blog post in February proposing a similar IOU-based currency, which he dubbed Future Tax Coin (FT-Coin). Varoufakis is not impressed by bitcoin as a currency, but he is persuaded that its underlying technology could be put to effective use in troubled economies.\n\u201c[T]he technology of Bitcoin, if suitably adapted, can be employed profitably in the Eurozone as a weapon against deflation and a means of providing much needed leeway to fiscally stressed Eurozone member-states,\u201d said Varoufakis. His post explained in detail how Greece could create an FT-Coin payment system with a Bitcoin-like algorithm to make it transparent, efficient and transactions-cost-free.\nAccording to Kelly, an IOU currency issued by a government under financial stress is not a workable solution. Its acceptance would depend on the public confidence in the Greek government and its ability to collect future taxes, which can\u2019t be taken for granted, and on the availability of easy ways for consumers to spend the new currency.\nKelly is persuaded that his alternative proposal \u2013 an opportunity for real-world implementation of block-chain technology \u2013 would work, and invites everyone to be a part of the solution by submitting proposals and commenting at drachmae.org. A wiki has been created where block-chain technology firms can submit and discuss all the technology that will be needed.\n\u201cThe aim of this WIKI is to support a white paper and project think tank looking to see if a viable working real-life solution can be delivered to help Greece with their real-world problems,\u201d says the drachmae wiki. \u201cAn open invite has been put out to the Crypto and wider technical community to understand how blockchain technology can be used to provide a working solution.\n\u201dOn May 20, Kelly will host an online symposium where companies will have the opportunity to present their piece of the workable solution.", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 14}

In parallel, Bitcoin policy think tank Coin Center claimed the role of interface to policy makers and regulators, with the publication of a framework for state digital currency regulation.\nNow, MIT and Coin Center are beginning to act jointly as Bitcoin representatives in policy and regulatory discussions, and expressing the concerns voiced by the Bitcoin community about the initiative of the superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS)Benjamin Lawsky, who is expected to issue this month a new regulation called BitLicense, much stricter than the agile framework proposed by Coin Center.\nOn March 27, Coin Center issued a detailed commentary to the current BitLicense text, in the hopes that some further adjustments may ensure that New York State becomes a leader in the financial technology of the future.\nIn a recent Medium post titled \u201cHow to Prevent New York from Becoming the Bitcoin Backwater of the U.S.,\u201d MIT Digital Currency Initiative lead Brian Forde praises the Coin Center commentary, and, in particular, the idea that regulations should strike a middle ground in such a way as to protect both consumers and digital innovators.\n\u201cIf done right, along the lines of what has been proposed by Coin Center, [regulation] will increase investment in digital currency startups, create jobs and allow consumers to receive cutting-edge financial services of the future, faster and safer,\u201d says Forde. \u201cAnd it\u2019s challenging to balance consumer protection, competition and prevent money laundering while also enabling innovative new industries to grow and prosper.\u201d\nSimilar arguments have been used to justify agile and enlightened Bitcoin regulatory frameworks, for example by the Isle of Man government, which wants to offer \u201cFreedom to Flourish\u201d to digital innovators while protecting consumers and keeping crime out.\nForde welcomes the initiative of Lawsky and his team to provide regulatory clarity for the emerging technology of digital currencies, but issues a clear warning that the current BitLicense text has four fundamental flaws:\nThe NYDFS would like to review and approve all software updates for Bitcoin apps;NYDFS approval would be required to raise a round of financing if any new investor provides an investment for more than 10 percent of a Bitcoin company;BitLicense proposal requires Bitcoin companies to get both a money transmitter license and a BitLicense \u2013 even though they have substantial overlapping requirements;The NYDFS would like to regulate Bitcoin wallet applications \u2013 even open source software that doesn\u2019t control users\u2019 funds \u2013 instead of specific illegal behaviors, which would be like trying to regulate Internet browsers instead of fighting online crime.\nRegarding the last point, it\u2019s worth noting that the framework proposed by Coin Center emphasizes that only operators with unilateral control of customer funds should be subject to a license requirement.\nForde is persuaded that, if the current BitLicense proposal is not significantly amended, New York would become a digital fintech backwater.\nIt\u2019s easy to see what would happen in that case: Innovative companies would leave New York and move elsewhere, resulting in loss of jobs and technology leadership. If similar, unnecessarily restrictive regulations were to be adopted in the rest of the United States, innovative companies would just move abroad. The recent decision of Xapo to move its corporate headquarters to Zurich, Switzerland, should be a wake-up call for U.S. regulators.

The majority of the company\u2019s user-base is from the United States, but there are also Taiwanand India branches.\nIt\u2019s been a busy few months for BitQuick. The volume of trades on their website has increased by nearly five times since January 2015, and it was just chosen as a top-five startup on Boost.VC\u2019s demo day, last week.\nIn comparison to conventional bitcoin exchanges, Jad Mubasalat, CEO of BitQuick tells Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cWhen you look at the typical incumbents, like Coinbase and BitFinex, they require multiple business day delays and a bank transfer to be able to buy your first bitcoins\u201d, which, admittedly, can be frustrating for those buying bitcoin to speculate, spend online, or perform cross border payments.\nThe delay factor of most big exchanges robs bitcoin of its novelty in instantaneous transfers without questions. \u201cBitQuick, however, allows anyone to trade bitcoin instantly with cash, without any risk of fraud,\u201d added Mubasalat. Unlike other OTC trading platforms such as Localbitcoins, Bitquick relies onBitGo\u2019s P2SH multi-sig protection technology with a hefty insurance level of $250,000.\nTroubled Beginnings\nLike many other Bitcoin early adopters, Mubasalat\u2019s experience dates back to managing an escrow service on Bitcointalk.org, where he had to learn about digital currency the hard way.\n\u201cI had the misfortune of being scammed for over 10 BTC and having my Mt. Gox account hacked and losing 20 BTC,\u201d he said.\nAt the time, the Bitcoin community lacked an international mainstream, user-friendly escrow interface for digital currency trading. Only a few days after he got robbed, someone was offering to sell a prototype for a Bitcoin middle-man service on Bitcointalk, and Mubasalat swooped in.\n\u201cI checked it out and loved it so much that I offered to buy the platform before he launched it for $300.\u201d After some tweaking here and there, BitQuick.co was officially launched in August 2013.\nTraction came along naturally to BitQuick through word-of-mouth, but Mubasalat needed help managing the increased trade volume because he was still studying Biomedical Engineering at Ohio State University at the time.\n\u201cSo I brought on Chad Davis in October, 2013,\u201d Mubasalat said. \u201cHe was already my roommate then, and we had known each other since the sixth grade, so it made perfect sense!\u201d\nThree Simple Steps\nThe user selects an order from the current order book, entering his or her email address and desired BTC to trade as well as his or her wallet info.The desired sum is paid in cash (physical bills) to the account shown on the confirmation page by going to any local branch of the seller\u2019s bank and filling out a deposit slip, or sending a SEPA transfer (EU customers).Finally, a link is sent to the user\u2019s email, where a proof-of-purchase receipt is uploaded.\nTransfer times in the United States have a three-hour guarantee, with no registration required. At only 1 percent to 2 percent in fees, the two-man team is \u201cworking towards integrating new payment methods in addition to cash deposit in the United States.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not far-fetched to see them dominating the OTC market soon, at least in the western world.\nA future for the Middle East\nAlthough Bitquick.me was launched for a short while to cultivate a market in the Middle East, it was soon pulled due to a lack of demand. Mubasalat said that they \u201cshut it down temporarily to focus on the United States platform.\u201d\nFor the foreseeable future, bitcoin might not gain a large everyday usage in the Middle East until there is an emergence of basic Bitcoin infrastructure such as wallets and exchanges, he said, given that the Middle East is largely underbanked and has plenty of access to mobile technology.\nIn the meantime, Bitquick.co users can look forward to a Clef integration, which should be completed in the next few months to give users an alternate mode of authentication.", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 14}

Exact description of the project is \u201cTo improve the efficiency of cross-border payments and turn the fragmented national markets for euro payments into a single domestic one.\u201d\nCoinify plans to expand its services to the countries under the SEPA project to make it even cheaper for those needing to make cross-border remittances/transfers, with 0% transaction fees.\nThe Danish bitcoin startup completed an early multi-million seed funding led by SEED Capital, the largest tech-focused VC firm in the nation, hoping to be the leading bitcoin startup in Denmark\u2019s cryptocurrency industry.\nThe investment from SEED Capital and Accelerance allowed Coinify to acquire one of the earliest European bitcoin exchange, Bitcoin Broker Bitcoin Nordic. Due to the acquisition, the bitcoin exchange of Bitcoin Nordic began to operate as a core service of Coinify, with the founder Lasse Birk Olesen appointed as the Chief Product Officer.\nCoinify later acquired the intellectual properties and all merchant relationships of one of the largest payment solution providers and payment gateway developer within Europe, Bitcoin Internet Payment System. Kris Henriksen, founder of Bitcoin Internet Payment System, said the company will now focus on technological innovations.\nPrior to the funding led by SEED Capital, Coinify was supporting more than 6,000 merchants and 7,000 just from Europe.

Now for the first time, supporters of indie artists can tip their favorite musicians and directly express appreciation for their content. But ChangeTip is not stopping there. Future plans include integration with other music platforms like Spotify, as well as Meetup.\n\u201cThe demand can get pretty overwhelming,\u201d Kemper states. \u201cThe most effective way to handle [the demand] is through a robust API. That way other platforms like Meetup and Spotify can just do their own native integration using our API.\u201d\nChangeTip\u2019s technology can be used for more than supporting indie artists and sending your friend\u2019s payment for beer. Recent integration with the Red Cross has allowed people from all over the world to donate over 28 bitcoins to Nepalese victims struggling after the earthquakes.\nValue Transfer Competition\nSending money over the internet is not new. Online payment platforms like Paypal and Venmo have existed for years. Kemper explains what separates ChangeTip from the rest of the pack, saying, \u201cChangeTip is international, bitcoin is international and with ChangeTip sending money can all done with no fees \u2013 instantly.\u201d ChangeTip is also able to process microtransactions, transactions with a value of less than a dollar, which are typically cost prohibitive for traditional payment methods.\nCoinbase had also developed a tipping service similar to ChangeTip but deferred to ChangeTip\u2019s platform, stating, \u201cChangeTip is an excellent example of a company which uses our APIs, and we\u2019d like to support them instead of competing with them.\u201d\nWith seemingly no competition in the \u201cmoney layer of social media,\u201d the ultimate goal for ChangeTip, according to Kemper, is for people to, \u201cunderstand they can become their own bank with bitcoin. What makes it feel like real money is that they offer to buy $20 USD worth of bitcoin, and you send them $20 USD worth of bitcoin on ChangeTip.\u201d\nCritics Speak Out\nBut not everybody is happy with ChangeTip. Some criticize the company for its centralized practices and off-chain transactions. In off-chain transactions a claim is made on an amount of bitcoin and sent from one person to another \u2013 no actual bitcoins get exchanged, and the transactions are not recorded on the blockchain. In this case, ChangeTip also controls the private keys for all bitcoin addresses associated with the service.\nWhile no transactions are recorded on the blockchain, off-chain transactions are beneficial because transactions can be made instantly without waiting for confirmations. Kemper comments,\u201cChangeTip is a transitional wallet for fast spending. We don\u2019t encourage people to keep a lot of money on their account.\u201d\nSome users have raised concerns about the amount of personal and social data that ChangeTip is collecting. For example, ChangeTip collects information about every social network where its users send tips. This means that ChangeTip could potentially be able to link a private Facebook profile to a Reddit account or a withdrawal bitcoin address for a user.\nDespite these concerns, ChangeTip continues to grow its presence across the popular social platforms and spread awareness about bitcoin.", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 15}

Harborly, which was already operational in Canada, will be the first U.S. bitcoin-buying service to offer users the ability to lock their bitcoin to a fixed U.S. dollar exchange rate when it launches the feature in June.\nHarborly, founded by computer programmers Connor Black and Gabriel Ferrin, will charge a one percent fee plus a 25-cent bank fee for bitcoin purchases. At launch, the retailer will be accessible to residents of Texas and California, but the startup plans on expanding to nine additional states in upcoming months.\nThe startup claims to have a close relationship with its U.S. banking partner, but said it was not at liberty to reveal which bank that is.\n\u201cHarborly\u2019s goal is to make buying, selling and using digital currency as easy and attractive as possible,\u201d Black, who is also the company\u2019s CEO, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe\u2019ve entered the U.S. market with a new, competitive alternative in the bitcoin retail space. As we secure a foothold and gain market share, we plan to launch additional innovative Bitcoin products, such as locked Bitcoin wallets.\u201d\nA Global Bitcoin Company\nHarborly is focused on operating internationally and plans to expand to countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America within a year. The startup thinks Bitcoin will cause a \u201ctechnology paradigm shift\u201d in the next 10 years and that by operating a global Bitcoin company they will be best positioned to take advantage of the new technology.\nThe young startup hopes to accomplish its ambitious global vision with regional advisers who will help Harborly find banking partners and adjust its business model for each region. The advisers include AlemHealth founder Aschkan Abdul-Malek, KCP Capital Managing Director Roderik van der Graaf; Afrasia Development Corp. Chairman Pierre Gussing, ex-Deutsche Bank executive Jordan Himel and Tauil & Chequer Advogados Rio de Janeiro partner Salim Saud Neto.\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s core architecture is innately borderless, but, generally speaking, it\u2019s impractical to use in most regions across the globe. Digital currency is in a unique position right now where its success is dependent on cooperation with the current financial system, and this cooperation is shaky at best,\u201d said Black.\n\u201cWe understand this and have aligned our vision accordingly,\u201d Black added. \u201cFirst, Harborly is going to continue bridging the gap between local payment methods and the bitcoin markets. And second, we\u2019re going to continue developing products and solutions that push past this status quo, enabling bitcoin to prosper in its own right.\u201d\nThe Bitcoin retailer recently raised a small seed round from undisclosed angel investors. The funds raised will give the company capital to act as market marker, grow its operations in the United States and expand upon its business development efforts in India \u2013 a country the startup is keen on expanding to. Black said the company is in talks with several payment providers in India, so when launched, Indians will have many payment options.\nHarborly, which plans on launching in the central Asian country in August, will create a remittance service from the United States to India, a nearly $12 billion remittance corridor. The startup will be the first company to offer a bitcoin remittance product between the two countries. Harborly will also operate its Bitcoin retail and price-locking service in the country.", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 18}

The service previously was available only in Kenya, where the company is headquartered. It hopes to undercut the fees charged by incumbents\u2019 remittance services.\nBitPesa launched its international money transfer in Kenya last year with the goal of expanding the service to the rest of Africa, something the company has slowly been working toward. Besides its remittance product, the company operates an exchange in Kenya and Ghana but Tanzania is the first country the startup has expanded its international money transfer service into.\nLike Kenya, Tanzania is a mobile money hotspot and an ideal country for BitPesa. The nation has a population of more than 43 million people, and, according to a2014 study by industry group Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (GSMA), has 31.8 million registered mobile money accounts. Tanzania received $317 million in remittances, $15 million of which came from Kenya, in 2012, according to a World Bank study.\nBitPesa\u2019s service allows anyone to send money to any Tanzanian phone number and charges a flat 3 percent on all its transfers. The service also promises the money will arrive instantly.\nA Competitive Market\nBitPesa will be joining a number of other companies that offer domestic (from city to rural) and international remittances in the country. Tanzania already has more than six mobile money operators who offer money transfer services to anyone in the country, and operators such as M-Pesa, who have partnered with Western Union, offer international mobile remittances.\nDue to a lack of studies and research about remittance fees in Tanzania, it is unclear whether BitPesa will have a cost advantage, but it is certainly likely, especially for inter-Africa remittances. A 2013 World Bank press release said that Tanzania, alongside South Africa and Ghana, were the most expensive African countries to remit money to. Fees reportedly could get as high as 20 percent.\nBitPesa\u2019s low flat rate might turn out be an attractive option for Tanzanians in Kenya remitting money back home, which is a smaller corridor and usually has higher fees. The same might hold true for Tanzanians living in Uganda when the Bitcoin startup expands there later this year. The service will of course allow people from anywhere in the world (excluding the United States) to remit money to the small African country as well.\nA more likely candidate for the service however, are businesses operating in Kenya, Tanzania and countries such as the United Kingdom, who have to send money to and from the African nation. BitPesa has already pivoted their service to better accommodate businesses\u2019 needs after finding a large interest in the service from the group late last year.\n\nImage via BitPesa.co.", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 19}

The system is built upon Open Reputation, an open source decentralized reputation platform under development, sponsored by The World Table, which maps identity and reputation onto the Internet-of-things (IoT).\nThe Open Reputation concept is open and flexible, able to accommodate diverse applications and usage patterns, from user reputation and \u201ckarma\u201d in online discussion spaces to automatic reputation-based agreements between agents in IoT networks of independent connected devices. Open Reputation models a universe of relations between entities and agents, anything in the IoT, each of which has an identity and may have a reputation. The initial Open Reputation source code is expected to be available before the end of 2015.\n\u201cEveryone and everything [in the reputation web] will have at least a public pseudonymous identity, created at the moment of interaction with any other part of the web,\u201d states the Open Reputation High Level Whitepaper. \u201cEveryone and everything may also have an encrypted shareable reputation, reflecting each of its transactions with any other part of the web. Some will choose to aggregate and share more reputation. Others will choose less. And our trust will flow accordingly.\u201d\nThe High Level Whitepaper mentions a wide range of use cases. Software companies could improve virus and spam detection, web content filtering and software updates, as well as Internet commenting, reviewing, sharing and advertising. Electronics companies could make fully autonomous systems that contract for their own maintenance and supplies. Social and financial qualifications could merge into a reputation economy that improves renting, sharing, purchasing, lending, insuring, interviewing and dating. Biotech firms could enhance big data projects with behavioral correlations. Governments could facilitate administration of voting and social services.\nIdentities, reputations, and relations persist in a decentralized public database anchored to a decentralized public ledger \u2013 the Open Reputation blockchain \u2013 both of which compensate participants via a cryptocurrency dubbed Cred. The Open Reputation platform uses a Byzantine agreement algorithm, detailed in the Open Reputation Low Level Whitepaper, to maintain consensus across hosts while supporting higher transaction rates than legacy blockchains. Cred tokens, which, according to the World Table team, will be exchangeable like other cryptocurrencies, will be paid by agents who perform transactions and earned by operators of computers that process the transactions and store related data.\nThe first product built on the Open Reputation platform will be a comment system for major media sites that will increase the quality of online engagement, boost ad revenues, and create brand lift.\n\u201cWhen our reputations are on the line, most of us choose to behave better \u2013 and that also happens to translate into more valuable web properties,\u201d said World Table CTO and EVP of products Lincoln Cannon. The company\u2019s pilot programs showed dramatic increases in \u201cgood\u201d behavior when people understood that they were being assessed by their peers. The company describes this feedback model as \u201cadding trust to the Internet.\u201d\n\u201cWith this announcement, we\u2019re making it clear that a whole class of online interactions are due for a major upgrade,\u201d said World Table CEO Bryan Hall. Patheos, one of the 200 largest content sites in the United States, is expected to begin testing the product in July. When fully deployed, The World Table comment system will be embedded in 20 million page views per month at Patheos alone.\n\u201cWe\u2019re creating an open-source platform so we can all see and understand how reputations are being formed from the data stream, and we\u2019re using a blockchain architecture to ensure that trust is distributed,\u201d added Cannon. \u201cNo central authority will have control over the information used to create your reputation.\u201d\nThe World Table, which has raised approximately $700,000 to date, is about to launch a seed financing offering for an additional $1.3 million on Angel List.", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 14}

As reported by Reuters, the Honduras government has agreed to use \u201ca permanent and secure land title record system using the underlying technology behind bitcoin.\u201d\nThe idea to use the blockchain to record land ownership in underdeveloped countries was a use case Factom had in mind since it went live late last year. According to a video by Factom, nearly 70 percent of Latin America\u2019s land is unregistered, leaving the poor, who have most of their wealth in land, vulnerable.\n\u201cIn the past, Honduras has struggled with land title fraud,\u201d Factom President Peter Kirby told Reuters. \u201cThe country\u2019s database was basically hacked. So bureaucrats could get in there and they could get themselves beachfront properties.\u201d\nThe details of the project remain scarce, and despite Reuters reaching out multiple times to the Honduran government to comment on the partnership, the publication did not get a response. The cost of the project or to what degree the government will be using the blockchain for land registry remains unclear.\nThe project makes Honduras the second government to use the blockchain to record government data. Earlier this month, Isle of Man\u2019s Department of Economic Development announced it would begin to record the number of digital currency businesses located on the island with the blockchain of the proof-of-stake digital currency Credits. The small country has been the focus of Bitcoin startups because of its business-friendly environment and has 25 cryptocurrency companies located there.\nViolent land disputes\nAccording to Factom, the company will be able to solve the country\u2019s land registry problems by recording ownership on the incorruptible blockchain. Bitcoin technology does have potential to be a better store of record than existing options, but, even so, it seems up in the air whether the technology will be able to solve the country\u2019s brutal land issues.\nThe roots of Honduras\u2019 land conflicts began in the 1970s and \u201980s when the government redistributed land, an estimated 120,000 hectares, to poor peasants. In the 1990s the land reform was reversed and, according to local farmers, much of the land was \u201csold\u2019 to large businesses and politicians through methods of bribery, threats and coercion.\nToday, with 79 murders per 100,000 people, Honduras is considered one of the world\u2019s most dangerous countries, and according to the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, the most unequal country in Latin America. Things have only gotten worse for the country since democratically elected Manuel Zelaya was ousted from power by businessman Roberto Micheletti.

HIS was able to identify Australian suspects attempting to engage in illicit trading of firearms.\nTwo months after, AFP partnered with HIS to instigate another secret operation targeting the Australian suspects.\nAs a part of the operation, HIS and AFP manipulated the secret account to complete six deals over Dark Web markets, which allowed them to identify the addresses of the buyers.\nAfter identifying the addresses, HIS and AFP received 15 search warrants in February and March of 2015, and seized most of the items in the addresses including four illegal firearms, ammunition, steroids, computer equipment and mobile telephones. Supported by the Queensland Police Service and Australian State and Territory Law Enforcements, the operation filed 34 charges against the individuals involved.\n\u201cDisrupting the supply of illegal firearms remains a priority for the AFP, and the success of this operation is another example of the results that can be achieved through cross-agency collaboration,\u201d said Steve Lancaster, ACBPS national director of investigations and assistant commissioner.

The company also recently expanded into mainland China through a partnership with Chinese Bitcoin company Melotic.\nMelotic recently shut down its own crypto-currency exchange, citing a lack of demand for the service. A company blog post read, \u201cSimply put, we did not experience enough growth in this product to justify the ongoing costs of development, maintenance, and support.\u201d According to BitSpark CEO George Harrap, his company closed their exchange for similar reasons.\n\u201cRecently our remittance business has [been] taking off with rising support for our key remittance corridors of the Philippines, Indonesia, Australia, Hong Kong and China. Given this, we have decided to temporarily retire the exchange and shift focus on building our remittance service as it is the best direction for Bitspark at this stage,\u201d read a BitSpark press release.\nThe First End to End Cash Bitcoin Remittance Service\nSpeaking with Bitcoin Magazine, Harrap said the company might reopen its bitcoin exchange in the future, but for time being it will focus on what it does best: remittances. BitSpark was the first company to offer a \u201cbitcoin in the background\u201d remittance product, meaning senders and receivers didn\u2019t have to fret with the hard-to-understand digital currency, but still got the benefits.\nThat \u201ccash-in, cash-out\u201d philosophy has since taken off, with many Bitcoin companies hoping to increase bitcoin adoption and remove the complexities of bitcoin. BitSpark will publicly announce a new remittance product at the Innotribe 2015 Asian Semi-Final showcase, a fintech startup competition run by the SWIFT payment network.\nHarrap was short on details about the new product, but he did say this when asked about what was still missing from the company\u2019s remittance offering:\n\u201cOnramps and offramps are still very difficult for Bitcoin. If you are in a less developed or small country, it may be very difficult buy or sell bitcoin, making remittance impossible. With a \u2018bitcoin in the background\u2019 product users don\u2019t have to worry about that, but, nonetheless, liquidity is an issue and something we\u2019re looking to solve.\u201d\nThe CEO also shared that though the company set out to help individual senders of remittances, the majority of the company\u2019s customers are businesses sending money to other businesses aboard. Though not its originally targeted customers, the new B2B customers were welcomed, and the company now will focus its efforts on better serving that new demographic. Harrrap added that the extra liquidity brought by the larger customers could help all customers, small and large.\nMelotic Partnership\nLike BitSpark, Melotic is not calling its quits when it comes to Bitcoin. Though the company has closed its exchange for good, it will be launching a new product, supposedly months in development, soon. Harrap was also unwilling give any details about the nature of his company\u2019s partnership with Melotic, but did said the two companies will be working together extensively in the future.\n\u201cWe are going to be working together to bring several new and innovative Bitcoin products and services to mainland China,\u201d he said. \u201cThe country accounts for the majority of bitcoin trading volume but is still a very untapped market when it comes to bitcoin.\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 8}

{"title": "Security Theater: The Illusion of Consumer Protection by Outsourcing Identity Verification", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/security-theater-illusion-consumer-protection-outsourcing-identity-verification-1431027355/", "birthday": "May 7, 2015  3:35 PM EST", "date": "2015-05-07 20:35:00", "content": "This is a guest post by Pamela Morgan, Esq., CEO of Third Key Solutions LLC.\nSecurity is tricky. Sometimes the most obvious security solution is ineffective and, worse, a distraction from the real risks and issues. In the security industry this is called \u201csecurity theater.\u201d It looks good and makes some people feel secure, but doesn\u2019t actually reduce risks. Sometimes security theater even exposes people to even greater risk. Such is the case with third-party identity verification for the recovery of bitcoin accounts. It seems like the obvious solution and feels secure, but, in fact, it exposes users to far greater risks without actually doing much to increase security.\nOne of the most appealing parts of using Bitcoin multi-signature addresses is the potential for complete separation of control, combined with enhanced security. There are a number of ways to implement multi-sig. The most popular today involves 2-of-3 with the end-user holding two keys and a wallet company holding one. While this model secures against misconduct by the company, it doesn\u2019t protect the customer from the very real risk of losing his or her online key or cold storage key or both. It concentrates risk and creates single point of failure with no redundancy.\nThis solution is flawed for a number of reasons. Doing cold storage right isn\u2019t easy or convenient. Sure, printing a paper wallet isn\u2019t that hard. But many people won\u2019t even do that. Instead they screenshot their private key. They store it on their online laptop, in a cleverly named file such as \u201cnot my bitcoin,\u201d or on their phone and forget all about it. Until they get hacked. Or lose their phone. Or their laptop dies. Unless you\u2019re really into bitcoin or have large holdings, if you\u2019re dealing with a broken, stolen or lost device, your bitcoin key backups might not be the first thing on your mind. You might even forget about them completely until it\u2019s too late. For those who do print paper wallets, they must be stored in a secure, fireproof, waterproof environment, ideally off-site. This adds another layer of work that most people put off indefinitely.\nMainstream customers don\u2019t expect to have to back up their own accounts. Password recovery is a standard part of interacting with websites and online services. Mainstream customers consider Bitcoin keys the same as passwords. I know some of you just cringed, but it\u2019s the truth. And so is this: Most people are bad at security; they\u2019re bad at choosing passwords and even worse at remembering them. Consumers expect their wallet company to have a \u201cbackup\u201d or be able to restore their funds. But if the customer has lost both of his or her keys \u2013 aka passwords \u2013 the bitcoin will be lost, too.\nAs an industry, we\u2019ve recognized this problem and tried to devise other solutions. The most common is to \u201coutsource\u201d the third key. Essentially, this configuration is also built on a 2-of-3, but instead of having the end-user deal with a backup key, a third party holds the third key instead of the customer. Issue solved! Article over \u2026 except it\u2019s not. While outsourcing does protect the end-user from the company and provides an independent way to recover funds, consumer privacy and data protection issues arise. Let\u2019s explore this in greater detail.\nToday the en vogue idea is to have the third party verify the identity or authenticate the recovery request directly with the end user. This independent user authentication is touted as an important security feature \u2013 but is it really? What risk does it protect against? Bad actors within the company, surreptitiously stealing bitcoin from customers? New industry auditable standards (CryptoCurrency Security Standard \u2013 Level III) require all company authorized signers to have their identities verified and undergo background checks, significantly reducing the likelihood of this scenario. This idea is so pervasive, however, that it\u2019s helpful to work through it.\nThe scam works like this: an employee creates fake recovery transactions and requests recovery from the third party. The third party contacts the end user who says \u201cNO!\u201d and the end user is protected. On its face, it seems to make sense. But when we look critically, the flaws become obvious. First, shouldn\u2019t the company\u2019s own internal governance processes be designed to prevent this? A few simple steps to separate duties within the company could prevent all but the most widespread collusion. Also, good governance processes should create a clear auditable and likely prosecutable trail should this level of malfeasance actually occur. Second, in order to be effective, the third party must have a pre-existing independent relationship with the end-user. This means the end-user must set up an account with the third party, separately, during the wallet setup process. Otherwise, the third party must rely on company data for verification, which leaves the bad-actor risk unmitigated. Requiring end-users to register with a third party and provide personally identifiable information is dangerous. It concentrates bitcoin user information into a small subset of the industry, recreating the client data honeypot problem and incentivizing law enforcement and criminals alike to target key storage services.\nIf the company is validating the recovery request, how can we be absolutely sure the customer actually requested it? We can\u2019t \u2013 even if a third party verified the request. The issue is not who verifies the request, but what data is being verified. Verifying a phone number, sms, and/or email address could work, unless the customer\u2019s smartphone has been stolen. Having a third party send an email or sms verification provides no more consumer protection than if the company itself sent the email or text to the user. If someone has access to the end user\u2019s authentication device, the bitcoin can be compromised regardless of whether the verification is performed by a third party or by the company itself. It\u2019s the illusion of protection without much substance.\nReal security requires more than an email, more than an sms; it requires knowledge or biometrics. It requires the company to obtain additional personally identifying data from users during setup. Then the question becomes should all of that data be shared with a third party? Isn\u2019t the company in a better position to secure and update that data, then validate against it when the time comes? Couldn\u2019t the recovery request be sufficiently approved and validated within the company without sharing all kinds of private customer data with outsiders?\nThere is another way. If, instead of outsourcing identity verification, we outsourced governance and process validation, end users would be protected from both bad actors within a company and data compromise arising from third-party data sharing. Recovery processes move from an afterthought, only applicable in times of emergency, to an integral part of operations. This makes sense from a user-retention perspective as well. As processes are tested and refined, the user-experience improves. The company learns what data it needs, what data it doesn\u2019t, and isn\u2019t concerned about a third-party customer data breach that jeopardizes its entire client base. The end user still is involved in the process, confirming identity and recovery requests with the company selected to be the service provider. The company coordinates the recovery process, and is there to help the customer throughout, while the third party introduces checkpoints in the process to ensure that it is followed correctly. This way, all parties are protected from rogue employees, sloppy process, human error or malicious actors.\nIn the end, the best way to handle the recovery of user funds is for the company with the strongest relationship with the user to stay focused on delivering the best customer experience. Recovery is not the time to hand users over to a third party. It\u2019s not more secure, it\u2019s just security theater.\n\nBackground by Freepik", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 7}

In particular, the BitGold platform allows for the quick settlement of gold trades so that a users\u2019 gold is easily acquired and accessible across various payment networks such as SWIFT, Visa, MasterCard, Interac, SEPA, UnionPay, Discover, American Express and others \u2013 including bitcoin.\nBitGold payment fees are higher than those of bitcoin payment processors but lower than most alternatives.\nThus, BitGold provides some of the advantages of bitcoin payments \u2013 faster and cheaper digital cross-border transactions \u2013 combined with the advantages of gold as a store of value, and can be seen as a Bitcoin-like system for gold. BitGold seems likely to become an appealing option for those who trust gold more than bitcoin.\nThe BitGold website states that the company views gold as a security switch for a world that is increasingly digital, and implemented security features to protect users\u2019 accounts and identities, such as secure vaults, full insurance with Lloyds of London against theft or loss, military-grade encryption (RSA 4096 and AES256) to secure users\u2019 accounts and personal information, and multi-factor authentication measures.\nBitGold claims that it offers the most competitive rates in the industry for buying and selling gold, and is the only platform that allows users to spend from their gold account.\n\u201cAt BitGold we have a mission to democratize global access to gold for stable savings, and to make gold useful in micro-transactions using the Internet or mobile phones,\u201d said co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer, Josh Crumb. \u201cNo matter where you live in the world, gold has held value over time relative to costs like food and energy that we require as humans, making it one the most important savings tools for most of the human population. We believe that by broadening access to a commodity-money that holds value we can help combat the rise in wealth inequality and the short-termism.\u201d\nBitGold is a Canadian corporation with offices in Toronto and Milan and a network of secure vaults for gold storage, operated in partnership with The Brink\u2019s Company, a global leader in security-related services for banks, retailers and a variety of other commercial and governmental customers. Users can choose where in the world they want their gold physically stored. The company\u2019s financial statements are audited by PriceWaterhouse Coopers.\nBitGold accounts are free and can be opened in minutes. New users are provided with a secure vault account to purchase and hold gold, the ability to make and receive instant gold payments, and a debit card for spending gold at traditional points of sale. Customers can fund their accounts with local-currency by using a network of ATMs. BitGold will not initially be available to U.S. residents, and will be unavailable to residents of sanctioned countries.\n\u201cWe are excited to unveil the BitGold platform, an architecture and technology that\u2019s taken years of careful planning and execution, which now allows users to seamlessly use gold again as a store of value and medium for payments,\u201d said co-founder and CEO Roy Sebag.\n\u201cAs a global asset, gold is recognized in nearly every culture as a long-term protector of value, but has been a poor medium of exchange compared to the advances in money technology,\u201d Sebag said. \u201cWe felt that gold needed the modernization and mobilization that\u2019s now happening in the global payments revolution. We have built a financial services platform that is as close to being counterparty-free as possible, enabling economic transactions within the existing global financial system to be settled in full reserved gold bullion.\u201d\nThe term \u201cBitGold\u201d may be confusing because it is also used by Bitreserve. Previously, it was used by cryptographer Nick Szabo for the cryptocurrency that he proposed before Bitcoin.\nOld Vault Door / CC BY 2.0", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 6}

Nowadays he works for the crowdfunding platform @goteofunding and as a advisor for social economy as well as social and cryptocurrency initiatives. You can reach him on Twitter at @ferranrego\nThe Spanish Bitcoin startup Coinffeine has launched a technical preview of its peer-to-peer (P2P) Bitcoin exchange. For the first time in a P2P exchange, users can experience an automatic and secure exchange similar to that offered by traditional exchanges, but with all the advantages of the P2P.\nThis version is intended to enable independent users and banks to try the application at an early stage, integrate it into their services and operate as Bitcoin exchanges. Anyone interested can download the application and, once it is installed, can begin to buy and sell bitcoin with other Coinffeine users.\nAlthough the Coinffeine Technical Preview is fully functional, they decided to go step-by-step in this early stage and distribute a version that is configured to be used on a Testnet or test blockchain.This way, users can try it without spending actual bitcoin.\n\u201cFrom today, the Bitcoin community can try Coinffeine, the first P2P Bitcoin exchange without arbitrators,\u201d said Alberto Go\u0301mez Toribio, CEO of Coinffeine. \u201cThis is the same version that we are offering to our bank partners and customers. Users will have to wait a little longer to use it with real bitcoins, but we are sure the wait will be worthwhile. We hope to transform Coinffeine\u2019s relationships with banks and payment processors into services that give them added value.\u201d\nTo test the platform, users can download it from the Coinffeine website. Just as users do not need to register to use BitTorrent, they do not need to register or provide any identification to use the application; they just install it and use it.\nCoinffeine is available for Windows, Mac and Linux.\nThe new version also introduces a new user interface, which is very different from its previous public appearance.\n\u201cFew Bitcoin products invest sufficient resources in design and usability. Our team continues to grow, and we have recently added an expert in this field to our team. He has been in charge of the transformation of Coinffeine\u2019s user experience, and the result is something completely new,\u201d said Go\u0301mez. \u201cCoinffeine\u2019s intention is to combine the concept of a wallet and exchange in the same product. It is a concept we believe have a great potential, and therefore we leave the following steps to the imagination.\n\u201cCoinffeine is a desktop wallet like Armory or Electrum with which you control your money safely,\u201d Go\u0301mez added. \u201cThis allows the company to avoid disclosing MSB, because we do not touch the money or the bitcoins from our users. We have learned much from the P2P industry and we want to apply many of these concepts to the FinTech ecosystem.\u201d\nThe release concludes the period of private testing that started December 18th, where Coinffeine presented the first alpha version of the platform in a public event in Madrid and a limited number of users joined the private user experience program.\nPrior to the release of the 1.0 version, they will evaluate the creation of a similar private testing program, but with real bitcoin and money.\nCoinffeine, a desktop application\nCoinffeine is a desktop application that has been defined by those who have tried it as the \u201cBitTorrent for Bitcoin.\u201d\nThe application works as a wallet, which allows users to store bitcoin safely and to connect an OKPay account \u2013 a payment processor similar to PayPal \u2013 to buy and sell bitcoin with other users.\nThe main difference with other P2P Bitcoin exchanges, such as LocalBitcoins or BitSquare, is that these exchanges function like eBay, i.e. with the need to establish contact with another person, agree on the price, and pay, trustingthat the user will receive the bitcoin. In Coinffeine, the process is automatic, safe and without arbitrators; the experience is the same as using an exchange as Bitstamp or Coinbase.\n\u201cIn LocalBitcoins or BitSquare you can\u2019t do trading efficiently because you can\u2019t keep orders in the market that run automatically. In these markets, when a user opens an order that corresponds to yours, you must intervene. Some platforms incorporate persons acting as an arbitrator in a dispute, which makes the process a little safer, but much slower and expensive,\u201d said Go\u0301mez.\nIn addition, with Coinffeine you do not have send your bitcoins to a platform to operate, as in Bitstamp. Instead, they remain at all times in your wallet, and only you have control over them. Coinffeine\u2019s design is similar to BitTorrent: It works between users. This means that the user does not have to register or provide personal information to use the application \u2013 he or she can simply download it and use it.\nCoinffeine also is open source and the entire source code is available to anyone who wants to review it on Github.\nBrief history of Coinffeine\nCoinffeine is a Bitcoin startup based in Madrid. It was founded in 2014 by four Spanish engineers with previous experience working together on projects related to distributed systems and big data.\nIt was the first company in the world that was founded using bitcoin as social capital. The potential of Coinffeine\u2019s work has been recognized at conferences such as CoinSummit. The Spanish organisation ICEX recently selected the startup as one of the 12 Spanish companies with most international outlook to be presented in Silicon Valley.

Digital Currency Summit founder Alex Puig led the event, with the participation of Bitcoin companies and senior financial experts.\nEach European Union (EU) country regards Bitcoin differently, and regulations are constantly evolving. The Startup Europe initiative seems a first step to establish EU-wide coordination of national initiatives for Bitcoin regulation and government-funded research.\nStartup Europe aims to strengthen the business environment for web and ICT entrepreneurs so that their ideas and business can start and grow in the EU. Startup Europe is part of Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE), an initiative of the European Commission, and contributes to the Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan.\nPuig opened the workshop and outlined the possibilities opened up by digital currencies based on blockchain technology, including micropayments, crowdfunding, distributed exchanges, smart property, property registry, ticketing, secure voting systems and more.\nAfter the opening, Paolo Tasca, research economist at Deutsche Bundesbank and founder of digital finance startup ECUREX Research, presented statistics and analysis extracted from a forthcoming Digital Currencies Market Report from ECUREX. He covered Bitcoin arbitrage opportunities and wealth distribution in the emerging Bitcoin economy, and other socio-economic and monetary aspects of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\nThe Workshop included talks by representatives of digital fintech firms Coinffeine, Bit2Me, Ethereum and Circle.\nTasca outlined for Bitcoin Magazine his impressions of the final roundtable led and moderated by the European Commission, with the participation of the speakers in the workshop and experts from the European Commission.\n\u201cThe recurring question was not \u2018whether\u2019 but \u2018how\u2019 the blockchain technology will impact on our daily life activities,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, the activities that will be firstly disrupted will be those related to the capital and banking sectors (we are already observing the first effects).\u201d\nHe noted that this also will have impact on the role of financial market authorities and central banks. There are many regulatory authorities and supervisory agencies (almost 100) in Europe currently, and their positions on the matter are most of the time not well coordinated or harmonized even within the same country. Tasca emphasized that a similar mis-coordination is also happening in the United States.\nHe added, that Europe, however, is strategically in a better position than the United States \u201cbecause we don\u2019t have yet a capital market union, and the infrastructures (\u2018bridges and streets\u2019) toward this goal need to be created from scratch: In EU we don\u2019t have \u2018legacies costs.\u2019 This is not the case for the USA where the capital markets are more radically and deeply developed.\u201d\nThus, the EU 2020 initiative Digital Agenda for Europe and the EU digital economy agenda, combined with the recent call for a capital market union with the aim and scope to unlock capitals around Europe, may open the doors to blockchain-based technology applications. The capital market union would give savers more investment choices and offer businesses a greater choice of funding at lower costs, among the other things.\n\u201cWe expect that the EU Commission will start funding research projects specifically targeted to digital currencies and blockchain technologies as recently done by the U.K. government,\u201d said Tasca, referring to the recent U.K. government decision to fund research in digital currencies.\nTasca\u2019s statements reflect his personal views and do not necessarily coincide with the position of the Deutsche Bundesbank.

Microwork.io is a startup that plans to put power back into the hands of the freelancer and allow the poor all over the world to earn a decent wage.\nMicrowork.io founder and CEO Andy Gough recently spoke to Bitcoin Magazine and answered a few questions about his new project. He described how blockchain technology can be used to \u201cfree workers all over the world from exploitation and abuse.\u201d\nGough\u2019s hopes for Microwork.io\nMicrowork.io is best described as a more open variation of Amazon Mechnical Turk. Although most freelancer websites seem to focus on the employer side of the equation, it\u2019s clear that Microwork.io plans to help all of the freelancers in the world who have dealt with dishonest clients in the past.\n\u201cWorkers will always have a voice with us,\u201d Gough said. \u201cWe are building our site with input from the workers to determine best practices and processes, and we hope to blaze a trail that will light up millions \u2013 and later billions \u2013 of the world\u2019s poor to a life without poverty.\u201d\nGough also noted that the platform will enforce a minimum wage on all contracts. Many users also may not even realize that bitcoin is being used for payments under the hood.\n\u201cOur users will mainly have no familiarity with bitcoin and the blockchain, so we also allow users to have their tasks deposit money directly in their bank accounts or some other method,\u201d Gough said. \u201cFor example, our users in the Philippines can select a smart task, do the work, and then the money will be deposited directly in their bank account as pesos. These users need not know that bitcoin is invoked, which we feel is crucial to onboard the 99 percent.\u201d\nFull verification of work via smart contracts\nPerhaps the most innovative, and somewhat sci-fi, feature of Microwork.io is the ability to finalize contracts without the help of a third party. Although it obviously will not work for every type of job posted on the platform, there are certain tasks that can be confirmed via smart contracts checking the status of a certain data feed on the Internet. For example, a smart contract can check to see if a specific type of code has been added to a GitHub repository or a tweet has been sent out by a specific Twitter account.\nWith these sorts of \u201csmart tasks,\u201d the completion of certain projects can be verified via a smart contract oracle system rather than a subjective third party. This feature has the potential to help workers avoid online jobs where the employer decides to not pay an employee after the work has been completed.\nMicrowork.io also will have an arbitration section for jobs that are unable to be completely verified via a smart contract. Gough was able to explain what would happen in a situation where the two parties on a contract disagree on the outcome of the project:\n\u201cWhen this happens, the original smart task spawns a predefined number of other arbitration smart tasks, which can then be picked up by members of the community,\u201d he said. \u201cArbitration smart tasks employ users to examine the original smart task requirements and vote to determine if the terms of the contract have been filled or not. These new contracts are funded by a percentage of the original smart task\u2019s funds.\u201d\nBitcoin for payments, Thelonious for reputation, and Codius for smart contracts\nMicrowork.io takes advantage of a variety of technologies in the blockchain ecosystem to create their market for smart tasks. Bitcoin is the only option for payments at this time, although (as mentioned above) many users will not even notice that bitcoin is being used behind the scenes.\nA customized Thelonious blockchain is used for Microwork.io\u2019s reputation system. Thelonious is a blockchain platform built by Eris Industries that was originally based on the Ethereum blockchain. The high level of customization offered by Thelonious made it the right choice for Microwork.io during the development process. As Gough noted, \u201cThelonious was used because at that time it was the only blockchain designer that could do what I wanted, but, as you know, bitcoin moves fast.\u201d\nCodius, which is developed by Ripple Labs, is the platform where the smart contracts are processed, but this could eventually change. Gough noted, \u201cWe hope to use Ethereum in the future.\u201d\nMicrowork.io is currently seeking seed funding in order to bring their vision to as many people around the world as possible.", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 7}

Using the Counterparty protocol, EverdreamSoft plans to place their online trading cards on the Bitcoin blockchain, along with a new cryptocurrency called BitCrystals.\nEverdreamSoft rose to popularity in 2010 with the release of their app Moonga, one of the first free-to-play games for iOS or Android. The online trading game has been ranked the top role-playing game in the Japanese App Store, and has been downloaded more than 250,000 times.\nIn order to compete with larger and better-funded competitors such as Blizzard Entertainment, EverdreamSoft continues to innovate in hopes of regaining the spotlight.

Rare digital game cards in Moonga will be placed on the Bitcoin blockchain so that they can be used in other Moonga games and easily transferred between players by sending a transaction .\nThe first new video game to take advantage of this ability will be Spells of Genesis.Moonga was a pure card game, requiring the player to build the perfect deck of Spells with which to battle. Spells of Genesis, however, adds an arcade twist, with additional elements of timing and strategy. The Spell cards are represented as orbs, which you must launch at enemies on the playing field to drain their life before they drain yours.\nBitCrystals, the cryptocurrency native to Spells of Genesis, will be used to fund the development of these features. One hundred million BitCrystals will be created on the blockchain as Counterparty assets, and 70 million of those will be sold in a presale lasting 30 days.\nBitCrystals derive their value from their utility and purchasing power in the Spells of Genesis game. Although you can effectively buy or sell cards in any currency, BitCrystals are necessary to purchase booster packs and bring new cards into the economy. The BitCrystals are then burned or recycled.\nEverdreamSoft claims the crowdsale will begin as soon as they gain enough social media traction, and that development is under way. Currently, only testers have access to the alpha version, but a beta version is scheduled to be released next month.", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 8}

Merchants can now receive payments directly into a Mycelium or Electrum wallet free of charge by installing a payment widget on their website or by integrating its open-source API into their backend.\nIn Friday\u2019s announcement on r/Bitcoin, Mycelium Community Manager Dmitry Murashchik states, \u201cMycelium Gear is a merchant processor which demonstrates something that has never been possible before Bitcoin: the ability for merchants to use a full featured merchant processor to receive payments online, and have the money go straight into their own wallets, even if that wallet is running on their own phone in their pocket.\u201d\nAccording to Murashchik, Gear \u201cgenerates invoices with unique addresses for every customer, automatically calculates the exchange rate, and sends a payment confirmation to the site\u2019s shopping cart software. Basically, instead of coding a basic thing from scratch on your own, you can use advanced shopping cart software that tracks customers, invoices, addresses, revenues, etc., and add this little plugin to it to allow it to process bitcoin transactions too.\u201d\nGear is built on top of the open-source Straight Server payment processor, originally developed by Roman Snitko in 2014. \u201cIt turned out [Mycelium] wanted to build the exact same thing and were looking for people capable of doing that,\u201d said Snitko in an email to Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThey liked that the project was open source and already the most important parts were functioning. So we decided to join our forces on this one.\u201d\nStraight Server uses the BIP32 protocol to generate a new bitcoin payment address for each customer order. As a result, merchants are able to receive payments directly from customers without Mycelium ever touching the funds. Once the payment is sent, Gear is able to track it through the Bitcoin blockchain. This capability is the pivotal feature of Gear: it is a tool that watches the blockchain and detects new transactions at the addresses associated with its clients.\nFrom there, Gear offers the same features as most other payment processors: webhooks that notify your website of the transaction, automatic currency conversion, and notification of over- and underpayments. A notable exception to this common ground is that Gear bypasses traditional payout structures associated with other payment processors. Funds are transferred instantly and directly into merchant wallets.\nIn the comments following the original Reddit post, Murashchik points out that it is also possible to integrate Mycelium Gear with a Trezor hardware wallet, with Ledger support \u201ccoming soon.\u201d It is also useful for sites that accept donations in bitcoin.\nAt the moment, prices can be set in USD and EUR. Bitcoin prices are automatically adjusted based on the price of bitcoin at the time of purchase. Gear has plans to introduce fast EUR withdrawals in the EU in the near future.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important to emphasize is that there are two things to supporting currencies: setting prices and conversion of received funds,\u201d Snitko explains. \u201cThe first one is easier and we plan to introduce many different currencies in a relatively short period of time. The second one is more complicated due to all the regulatory problems and also the fact that by design Mycelium Gear doesn\u2019t touch the merchants money and thus has no ability to convert them at this point.\u201d\nMycelium Gear adds to its trustless, hands-off approach to payment processing by eliminating personal information gathering, approvals, and KYC/AML requirements. According to the company website, \u201cBecause Gear doesn\u2019t hold or even touch the money, we don\u2019t need to know any intrusive information about the merchants.\u201d\n\u201cMycelium\u2019s hope is that Gear will encourage even more merchants to adopt bitcoin and completely change the way merchant transactions are done,\u201d Murashchik adds, \u201cthus continuing our goal of decentralizing everything, improving privacy, and eliminating unnecessary third parties in the Bitcoin economy.\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 10}

As industry analysts have pointed out, since the violations, the company has drastically increased its anti-money laundering (AML) efforts. But this might just be the beginning of more strict regulatory actions against digital currency companies.\nRegulators shut down previous digital currency businesses that violated financial regulations such as Bitinstant, but Ripple Labs has escaped this fate. Many have attributed this to the company\u2019s proactive and aggressive measures to comply with regulations since the 2013 guidelines for digital currency companies published by FinCEN and its willingness to work with regulatory agencies.\n\u201c[A]s the government has recognized in today\u2019s agreement, Ripple Labs has cooperated extensively with the government during its investigation and has taken a number of important steps over the years to build and strengthen our compliance programs,\u201d reads a statement by Ripple Labs spokeswoman, Monica Long. \u201cThese measures include: registering a subsidiary, XRP II, LLC, as a money service business to handle XRP sales for the company in 2013, in response to and in an attempt to comply with the March 2013 Guidance by FinCEN; hiring a chief compliance officer in January 2014, a general counsel, and a BSA officer in February 2015; and continuously enhancing an anti-money laundering program,\u201d\nBanking Partners Are Committed\n\u201cRipple is infrastructure technology for banks to build compliant payment networks. The settlement announced today does not impede our ability to execute on those bank integrations. We\u2019re continuing to focus on working towards an Internet of Value,\u201d said Ripple Labs in a public statement.\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to several banks and financial institutions that are in discussions or partnerships with Ripple Labs to see if the recent penalties have affected their relationship with the digital currency company. Though none were very forthcoming, no one said they are ending their partnership the digital currency company based on the settlement.\nMatthias Kr\u00f6ner, co-founder and CEO of Fidor Community Bank, an innovative European Bank which ha partnered with Ripple for international transfers, suggested the bank\u2019s relationship with Ripple hasn\u2019t changed since the FinCEN penalties but wasn\u2019t willing to discuss the matter in detail.\n\u201cIf we would see a problem with one of our partners, we for sure would discuss such a question confidentially with those partners,\u201d Kr\u00f6ner said.\nA similar answer was given by Kristin Kelly, director of global corporate communications at Western Union, who said the global remittance company still stands by their comments made earlier this month. According to those comments, Western Union is in preliminary discussions with Ripple Labs to launch a pilot settlement program.\n\u201cNow it looks like Ripple addressed the issues and paid the fine and are moving forward, and that is how it usually works when a bank or a casino or another money-service business is involved,\u201d said vice president for payments and cybersecurity at the American Bankers Association, Steve Kenneally, in interview with American Banker. The fact that the process is working like it would with any other company could work in Ripple\u2019s favor, he said.\nRipple May Be Clear, but Other Bitcoin Companies Could Be Next\nFor a long time, just like Ripple Labs, Bitcoin companies operated in a sort of financial \u2018Wild West\u2019. It was uncertain where these new category of companies fit within the law and current financial regulations. Only recently have digital currency companies received guidance from regulatory agencies on the matter, although some uncertainty still exists.\nCarol Van Cleef, co-chair of the global payments practice group at the law firm Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, told American Banker that early Bitcoin companies might face similar penalties for prior regulatory sins.\n\u201cFinCEN clearly has the intention to hold entities responsible from the time they flip the switch to turn on their business model. Compliance is expected from the beginning; they make a big point of the fact that [Ripple Labs] was operating for a period of time without being properly registered as an MSB,\u201d she said. \u201cFinCEN is only beginning its enforcement examination process of MSBs in the digital currency space; as with any industry in the first round of compliance examinations, we\u2019re likely to see a number of companies being cited for compliance shortcomings.\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 8}

He also added that business remains as usual for his exchange.\n\u201cCoinsecure has not been contacted by any local law enforcement so far,\u201d said Kalra. \u201cThis is due to our strong and legally guided KYC (know-your-customer) policy and terms and conditions. Our KYC policy includes strong and valid procedures to verify our clients, and we only allow clients to deposit or withdraw fiat to their verified linked bank accounts.\u201d\nHe also added the exchange\u2019s two banking partners, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank, are still fully committed to banking the Bitcoin startup.\nKalra went on to say that he remains optimistic about the future of Bitcoin regulations in India and that his company has had a very positive experience with the Indian government.\n\u201cI feel that all the government authorities in India have been cooperative towards our Bitcoin businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have not faced any engagement from regulation departments.

But due to the country\u2019s poor banking systems and expensive remittance services, overseas Filipino workers and the local workers working far from their provinces have always searched for alternative systems for transferring cash.\nFor generations, remittance services including Lhuiller and Palawan Pawnshop dominated the market in the Philippines, despite its high transaction fees. On average, the fees are close to 10 percent for small transactions ranging from $1 to $300. The majority of overseas workers have been using expensive remittance services due the bank\u2019s inefficiency in sending payments and its substantially high minimum deposit rates.\nSince late 2013, Bitcoin startups aiming to introduce bitcoin as a remittance solution began to emerge. One of the first Bitcoin startups to do so is Coins.ph, founded by Ron Hose.\nCoins.ph\nCoins.ph launched its platform in 2014, announcing a major partnership with Metrodeal, the largest e-commerce store in the Philippines. Started out as a bitcoin payment processor for merchants and a bitcoin exchange, Coins.ph evolved into a complete bitcoin service through partnerships with the country\u2019s largest financial institutions and banks including the aforementioned remittance service Lhuiller, BDO (Banco de Oro), BPI, China Bank, HSBC, RCBC, MayBank and many others.\nOn December 17, 2014, Coins.ph partnered with Security Bank, which has allowed Coins.ph users to withdraw cash in 450 ATMs nationwide. The partnership also meant that Coins.ph users could purchase bitcoin by depositing cash to the ATMs.\nSince December, Coins.ph continued to add features to help day-to-day purchases, currently allowing users to pay bills for utilities (electricity and water), credit card, cable providers, insurance and tuition.\nBitSpark\nLaunched in late 2014, Bitspark is a bitcoin remittance startup which initially aimed to help overseas Filipino workers transfer cash to the Philippines using bitcoin.\nThe Hong Kong-based startup charges less than 1 percent in transaction fees, which Is substantially lower than Lhuiller, Palawan Pawnshop and the global remittance service Western Union.\nTo send payments, Hong Kong-based workers can simply visit the Bitspark booth in World-Wide House (a place where most migrant workers spend their time during weekends) and give them Hong Kong dollars and specify the preferred bank outlet.\nDue to its success in Hong Kong, BitSpark expanded to Indonesia in January of 2015, targeting more than 165,000 Indonesians working or staying in Hong Kong. Bitspark partnered with Artabit, an Indonesian bitcoin payment solution to allow the recipients to collect Indonesian Rupiah from a bank or a post office.\nDuring its expansion, Bitspark stopped charging its transactions fees in percentages. Instead, the startup began charging a flat fee of $25 HK (to Indonesia) and $14 HK (to the Philippines).\nIn April, Bitspark partnered with multi-sig institutional wallet security provider BitGo, following the startup\u2019s first external funding round.\n\u201cThere are a number of Bitcoin startups involved in the Philippines remit corridor but the volumes are still low compared to the established incumbents so there is still plenty of room for growth,\u201d the CEO of Bitspark George Harrap told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\u201cI think you will continue to see this area grow over the coming years and Bitcoin remittances reaching more people forcing existing businesses to consider adopting Bitcoin as a means of transmission of money,\u201d he added.\nHarrap also told Bitcoin Magazine about the company\u2019s vision for expansion, explaining, \u201cUltimately we want to continue to bring our services to more people in more places throughout the APAC region. We are seeing a rise in B2B interest, which is something we are pursuing at the moment and we\u2019re focusing on the sell sell sell, getting the word out.\u201d\nRebit.ph / Satoshi Citadel Industries\nLaunched by the co-founder of Satoshi Citadel Industries, Miguel Cuneta, Rebit.ph allows its users to receive cash in more than 20 different bank outlets. Rebit receives BTC from anywhere around the world and converts the BTCs to Filipino pesos with a zero percent conversion fee.\nThe parent company of Rebit.ph, Satoshi Citadel Industries, has acquired and launched many of the Philippines\u2019 active Bitcoin startups including the nation\u2019s first bitcoin exchange Buybitcoin.ph, Bills Ninja, prepaidbitcoin.ph and Bitmarket.ph.\nRemittance is and has always been a serious problem for both overseas and local employees in the Philippines. Although trading volumes of bitcoin remittance startups are substantially lower than the existing remittance services, the number of employees sending remittances in bitcoin is rising so quickly that the bitcoin remittance startups may be able to compete with the existing remittance services such as Western Union or Lhuiller in the near future.", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 11}

While, DEVgrants is not a funding platform, it does provide resources to continue building a Dapp.\nCCN, founded in 2014, is a nonprofit dedicated to blockchain education, innovation and development. CCN focuses on connecting the novice with the experts and has reached a network spanning the globe in more than 150 locations.\nProponents of DApps claim that the decentralization of software services people use on a daily basis, such as Dropbox, WhatsApp and eBay, could greatly benefit the users of those services. For example, a decentralized marketplace would mean that buying and selling goods and services would be conducted directly between buyer and seller without unwanted third-party involvement, and would be regulated by cryptocurrency smart contracts and arbitration.\n\u201cOver the next decade businesses will start assessing their decentralization strategies. Decentralization technology undermines the core control mechanism businesses use today to monopolize their customer base thanks to its abstraction effect,\u201d states the Corona whitepaper.\nCorona also outlines the possibility that decentralized identity, reputation and credit rating applications could possibly be the backbone in the creation of more competitive peer-to-peer insurance and loan markets which have the potential to disrupt these industries, as well as serving the unbanked worldwide who cannot currently benefit from such protection. Decentralized messenger and network applications free from government interference could also have positive impacts on democracy and freedom of speech.\nAbout Corona\nFounded by Greene and backed by an experienced team of developers and advisors, Corona strives to make DApps easier to develop while promoting their use cases.\nAccording to Greene, DApps can be built \u201cin a shorter time period compared to standard applications because of the turnkey infrastructure, lowered barrier to entry and simplified deployment.

On Monday, May 11, the company announced that it would begin to leverage the colored coin protocol Open Assets to \u201cexpand and enhance the equity management capabilities offered by its Nasdaq Private Market platform.\u201d\nAccording to Nasdaq CEO Bob Greifeld, the distributed ledger function of the blockchain will \u201cmodernize, streamline and secure typically cumbersome administrative functions, and will simplify the overwhelming challenges private companies face with manual ledger record-keeping.\u201d\nNasdaq joins the blockchain-integrated securities exchange market field just a few weeks after Overstock\u2019s Medici Projectfiled S-3 forms with the Securities and Exchange Commission, outlining its intention to issue new stocks or securities, including the potential to issue digital securities.\nIn an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Overstock.com\u2019s director of communications, Judd Bagley, welcomed Nasdaq\u2019s announcement, noting several ways in which it could have a positive impact on the financial sector.\nThe first is in overcoming the hurdle of market acceptance. \u201cThe actual people who will be clicking the mouse authorizing real trades need to feel comfortable with this new paradigm, which upends a 75-year-old system some don\u2019t currently see as broken,\u201d said Bagley. Having Nasdaq on board could help to push blockchain technology into the financial sector mainstream.\nRegulatory acceptance is another matter. According to Bagley, it\u2019s up to companies like Overstock and Nasdaq \u201cto impress upon regulators that a stock exchange based on decentralized ledgers is not only as good as what\u2019s currently in place, but better.\u201d\nBagley said that with Overstock in the process of getting SEC approval to issue digital shares, it has developed some \u201cvery interesting financial innovations\u201d that will be rolled out on the Medici platform in the near future.\n\u201cUnderstandably, we\u2019re expecting some probing questions. After all, regulators are, by nature, conservative. But this is one of the reasons we are so pleased to see NASDAQ getting in on blockchain trading. We can use all the support we can find when it comes to getting this new approach approved. Having NASDAQ working to meet the same regulatory goals as we are can only help us.\u201d\nOverstock CEO Patrick Byrne has been outspoken in the past about Wall Street\u2019s culpability when it comes to shielding bad actors in the financial sector. Bagley does not expect that Nasdaq\u2019s latest move will do much to affect this larger problem.\n\u201cOne of the reasons young companies avoid the public equity markets is concern over the predations of illegal short sellers,\u201d he explained. \u201cBlockchain trading of pre-IPO shares will go far to keep bad actors from preying on these companies. So on that level, Nasdaq is joining us in doing a good thing.\u201d\nTrading of pre-IPO shares, however, represents only a small fraction of the overall financial trading picture, Bagley added. \u201cDecentralized ledgers like the blockchain are also extremely well-suited for the trading of shares of public companies, and so we\u2019re incorporating that functionality into Medici as well.\u201d\n\n\n\nPhoto: Time Square/New York / CC BY 2.0", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 12}

The team created a way to connect financial institutions with people living in remote or undeveloped villages using blockchain technology.\nBlockIntel won third place with a program that visualizes the blockchain and uses know-your-customer controls to catch suspicious transactions. NuBank and BlockIntel won cash prizes as well, $10,000 SGD ($7,500 USD) and $8,000 SGD ($6,000 USD), respectively.\nAccording to Ron Hose, CEO of Asian bitcoin exchange Coins.ph, the hackathon did a lot more than just build new products and services; it brought people from the digital currency and financial worlds together.\n\u201cI really feel like this event marked a milestone for blockchain tech in Asia,\u201d Hose said. \u201cBeyond emphasizing how valuable this technology is to solving banking problems and giving a platform for new ideas, the hackathon brought together great minds and industry influencers to think together about the future on blockchain and the banking industry as a whole.\u201d\n\nA bank-backed blockchain hackathon\nThe event was located at StartupBootcamp Fintech Singapore, an accelerator for financial startups, and was done in partnership with Singaporean Bitcoin company, Coin Republic. The event featured numerous executives and experts from the region\u2019s finance and technology industries. The judges panel included IBM Executive Architect Tan Kah Seng and Sim Boon Kee Institute for Financial Economics Professor Dr. David Lee.\nAccording to Adam Giles, co-founder and CEO of Neuroware, some of the hackathon participants weren\u2019t familiar with blockchain or bitcoin at all but were interested in exploring the technology. Giles and his company spent the two days prior to the hackathon hosting workshops with the attendees and familiarizing them with the blockchain. Neuroware\u2019s API Blockstrap, which allows developers to create apps for a number of digital currencies, along with Bitx\u2019s and Colu\u2019s API were used in the hackathon.\n\u201cConsidering this was the first time a bank has ever so publicly backed blockchain technology it\u2019s difficult to imagine how it could have gone better,\u201d Giles said. \u201cDBS were very well organized and made every effort to understand the technology and work with the developers. All teams got to keep the IP for their ideas, and DBS could be working with some in the future to see how they can support them. Startupbootcamp also provided a great venue and did a fantastic job on organizing the hack and looking after everyone involved.\u201d\n\nThanks to CoinGecko, David Moskowitz and Tim Swanson.

It is what enables the digital currency to properly function and can also be used to record any kind of information in a public ledger.\n\u201cPasscards are a digital form of identity and access control designed to initially replace passwords, and in the future, replace forms of physical identification like passports and driver\u2019s licenses.

The future of identity is here,\u201d read the company\u2019s blog post.\nYour access to everything\nPasscards will expand upon the company\u2019s earlier blockchain identity product, which was just a onename.io-hosted profile, by creating a fuller identity, allowing users to post their Passcard on websites, such as a blog or company website.\nThe move in is preparation of enabling blockchain profiles to be used to log into websites and apps. That will give the product its first real use case and actual utility.\n\u201cCurrently, passwords help you access your online life just like your wallet and keys help you access your physical life. At a high level, passwords, identity cards, and keys are all forms of access control. Want to enter a bar? Show an identity card that says that you\u2019re over 21. Want to access your Twitter account? Login with the username/password that you used to signup. Want to enter your home? Use the key that unlocks the door,\u201d read a public statement.\nPasscard can be seen in use on the blog of Onename investor Fred Wilson and the team page of decentralized marketplace project OpenBazaar. To get your own passcard, you can sign up at a registrar such as Onename.io or Namecoin.info. Onename also created Passcard.info, which serves as a portal for the new product and hosts a list of registrars.\nPasscard uses a technology called Blockchain Name System (BNS), formerly called Onename, which, according to the company\u2019s founders, Muneeb Ali and Ryan Shea, is similar to Domain Name System (DNS), but offers more security as there are \u201cno trusted third parties or servers.\u201d\nThe startup will be announcing more about BNS and will launch the app login feature soon.\nOnename was founded in March 2014.

The reports have been announced at the EBAday payments conference in Amsterdam, Finextra reports.\nThe Euro Banking Association is a practitioners\u2019 body for banks and other service providers supporting a pan-European vision for payments, with membership including more than 180 institutions from across Europe and beyond. Its mission is to provide payment professionals with a country-neutral forum for driving and contributing to the delivery of pan-European co-operative payment initiatives and business practices.\nThe reports, produced by the EBA\u2019s Working Group on Electronic Alternative Payments (e-AP WG), are intended to help financial institutions (FIs) navigate the changing payments landscape. The publication of the EBA reports follows closely the EU Commission\u2019s \u201cBlockchain and Digital Currencies Workshop\u201d on April 27.\nAccording to the EBA, digital currencies such as bitcoin or ripple have the ability to disrupt the payment and banking landscape and assist in the fight against cyber-criminals.\nThe opinion paper on Digital Customer Service Interfaces focuses in particular on a \u2018virtual layer\u2019 on top of the existing single euro payments area (SEPA) transfer and card payment infrastructure, referencing the EBA\u2019s MyBank offering that is seeking to become a \u2018one stop shop\u2019 e-commerce transaction platform.\nThe crypto-technologies paper, titled \u201cCryptotechnologies, a major IT innovation and catalyst for change,\u201d is an information paper for transaction banking and payments professionals. It details four categories (currencies, asset registry, application stack, asset centric), applications such as remittances and real-time payments and scenarios, and describes the respective potential for these different categories of applications to have a major short-term impact on the architecture of systems and processes in a number of digital transaction-based industries. It also details four use cases for the most promising category.

Recent developments have seen the creation of digital currencies such as bitcoin, which combine new currencies with decentralized payment systems.Although the monetary aspects of digital currencies have attracted considerable attention, the distributed ledger underlying their payment systems is a significant innovation.As with money held as bank deposits, most financial assets today exist as purely digital records. This opens up the possibility for distributed ledgers to transform the financial system more generally.\n\u201cDigital currencies do not currently pose a material risk to monetary or financial stability in the United Kingdom, but it is conceivable that potential risks could develop over time,\u201d reads the conclusion of the Bank of England\u2019s report. \u201cThe distributed ledger is a genuine technological innovation that demonstrates that digital records can be held securely without any central authority.\u201d\nA recent U.K. Treasury document titled \u201cDigital Currencies: Response to the Call for Information\u201d shows that the U.K. government is interested in supporting and understanding blockchain-based digital fintech, and understands the potential benefits it could bring to society.

The Letter of Intent follows last week\u2019s announcement that Bitcoin Shop raised $2.3 million in a venture capital funding round.\nBitcoin Shop, quoted on the OTC Market with the ticker BTCS, is based in Arlington, Virginia. Besides operating an e-commerce store which accepts a variety of digital currencies and offering a multi-signature wallet with bank-grade security, the company is the lead investor in Bitcoin ATM manufacturer Coin Outlet, and runs bitcoin mining operations in a new 83,000-square-foot facility.\nThe new mining facility is expected to handle more than 10 megawatts of power and up to 40,000 TH/s (terrahash per second) of mining hardware for \u201ctransaction verification\u201d operations. (That means bitcoin mining, but with a crisp business-like aura.)\nBitcoin Shop wants to expand and consolidate its position as one of the leading players in the Bitcoin space. \u201cWe believe the sustained decline in the price of bitcoin has created tremendous opportunities for us to further expand our business and seize opportunities created from the market downturn,\u201d said CEO Charles Allen, commenting on the latest funding round. \u201cWith the completion of this financing we believe we are well positioned to be a leading Bitcoin- and blockchain-focused company.\u201d\nThe funding announcement noted that the company plans to leverage its transaction verification services business while it builds a universal digital currency platform with the goal of enabling users to engage in the digital currency ecosystem through one point of access.\nThe merger with Spondoolies-Tech is subject to a number of conditions, including satisfactory completion of diligence and execution of definitive agreements, and it will, therefore, probably take some time to work out the details. It\u2019s expected that the merger will build a fully integrated transaction verification services business using Spondoolies-Tech mining technology.\nBoth companies believe the anticipated combination of Bitcoin Shop and Spondoolies-Tech will create the world\u2019s first publicly traded company to produce Bitcoin transaction verification equipment.\n\u201cOur key goal in 2014 was to create the partnerships needed to build an ecosystem and start laying the foundation to put our vision into place,\u201d said Allen. \u201cOnce completed, our merger with Spondoolies would be a significant leap forward in making this ecosystem a reality. [O]ur next objective will be to complete the development and production of a next-generation chip to drive our transaction verification services business and to generate revenue from the combination.\u201d\nSpondoolies-Tech is a digital currency hardware manufacturer. Founded in 2013 by a group of Israeli high-tech veterans, the company raised $10 million in capital from leading Israeli venture capital firms with the goal of building Bitcoin transaction-verifying servers from the bottom up, creating the infrastructure on which digital currencies will flourish.\nSpondoolies-Tech produces a line of bitcoin mining hardware rigs, considered among the best in the industry. Besides, it offers cloud mining services in cooperation with Genesis Mining.\n\u201cOver the last several months, we\u2019ve worked closely with Charles Allen and the BTCS team to establish the nature of our potential partnership,\u201d said Spondoolies-Tech CEO Guy Corem. \u201cThe synergy between the teams is amazing.

Further, MonetaGo allows trades to be settled in multiple currencies. This is possible because the company is built using the AlphaPoint trading platform, a company that Avedisian launched in 2013.\nJesse Chenard, CEO and co-founder, offered the following example: \u201cIf someone wanted to buy $100 worth of bitcoin on a U.S. exchange, but there was only $50 in available bitcoin, the trade couldn\u2019t occur. MonetaGo would connect that trade to another exchange that also had $50 in available bitcoin, allowing the trade to go through.\u201d\nChenard has experience taking small ideas and making them large. He is the founder of Tremor Video, which had its initial public offering in 2013. The rest of the founding team is composed of the former Creative Director at NASDAQ, one of the co-founders of igot, the president of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, and Avedisian.\nThe company is in beta and is privately funded. While based in New York City, the company isn\u2019t expanding into the United States yet.\n\u201cThe regulation is still too uncertain in the United States,\u201d Chenard explained.\nThe Coming Consolidation of Exchanges\nThe launch of another exchange begs the question: Does the ecosystem actually need another one?\nChenard doesn\u2019t see it being a problem for MonetaGo because they view their company as more business-to-business, targeting the other exchanges. But he does agree that there will be consolidation in the industry over the next year and a half.\n\u201cIf you look at some of these countries, they might have four or five different exchanges that are operational. You have one that is by and far the leader, you might have another that has some volume, but the remaining two or three really have no volume,\u201d Chenard explained. \u201cWhile they might have really great products, they just can\u2019t get the volume to compete. These will either be acquired because of their products or they will be able to work through our exchange to gain that volume.\u201d\nWhere\u2019s Wall Street?\nLiquidity is one of the reasons Wall Street has had to stay out of the sector. The amount of money Wall Street is looking to move is significantly greater than what is available on the exchanges.\nAccording to Chenard, though, it\u2019s a lack of understanding that has kept Wall Street from getting into bitcoin. \u201cThey\u2019ve likely heard of bitcoin, but you ask them too much about it and they just don\u2019t really understand,\u201d he said.\nOn top of that, there is fear of bitcoin going away. \u201cSo many businesses have shut down over the years, taking their consumers\u2019 bitcoin with them, that there is fear for a lot of Wall Street,\u201d he said.\nFundamentally, until Wall Street understands the state of the asset and are certain their money won\u2019t disappear, the large money firms are going to hang out on the side. Bitcoin just isn\u2019t worth it for traders looking to move $50 million a day, Chenard said.", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 30}

Self-described as a full-service investment bank and wealth management firm, Maxim has taken the most aggressive approach as of yet to get investors in GBTC to sell their shares.\nIn the beginning of April, trading began for shares of the Bitcoin Investment Trust, one of the products rolled out by Barry Silbert\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new Grayscale Investments. Despite the fact that trading was possible, none have been executed.\nThe rules put forth by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) stated that only those who have held shares in BIT for longer than a year will have the option to sell their shares on the OTCQX exchange.\nThere has been concern that few investors would be willing to liquidate their positions because it would be at a significant loss. Considering the rule of one year, if an investor were to have bought shares on April 1, 2014, he or she would have bought with the value of a bitcoin at $481.20. Each share of GBTC is equal to roughly 0.1 bitcoin; therefore, a bid of $35 per share is only equal to $350 per bitcoin.\nThis is significant premium over the current price of bitcoin, but it still at least $130 per bitcoin less than what an investor who is allowed to liquidate would have paid. However, BIT launched in September 2013, when the price of bitcoin was $130 per coin, so there could be investors looking to sell.\nAt present, the other firms that have made bids to acquire shares of GBTC are Puma Capital, bidding for 100 shares at $38 per share, Canaccord Genuity, bidding for 100 shares at $37.50 per share, Citadel Securities, bidding for 100 shares at $36 per share, and KCG Americas, bidding for 100 shares at $35.55 a share.\nBitcoin Magazine has reached out to Maxim Group for comment.\n\nPhoto by Rafael Matsunaga / CC BY 2.0\n", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 29}

The event will be in New York City from April 30 to May 1, with an optional workshop on May 2.\nThe topic of compliance and regulations is a tough one for Bitcoin companies. AML Know-Your-Customer and OFAC regulations are difficult for large and established companies, as seen recently when PayPal was fined $7 million by the U.S. Treasury Department for processing illegal transactions from blacklisted persons.\nAccording to the president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, Perianne Boring, AML can be one of the most complex and difficult laws to be compliant with. And for a startup with little capital, a small staff, and little knowledge of the regulations it can be extremely difficult. When you add the nascent state of digital currency regulations on top of that, it can seem overwhelming.\nThe United States has been particularly difficult when it comes to regulations. The infamous New York BitLicense proposal, which is a proposed special license for digital currency companies in New York State, is set to be finalized \u201csoon,\u201d but an exact date has not been given. Analysts anticipate that the regulation could set a standard for Bitcoin regulations across the United States and possibly in other countries.\nConnecting Digital Currency Companies, Bankers and Regulators\nThe boot camp is one of the few opportunities to learn about proper AML compliance for Bitcoin companies. It also is an opportunity for Bitcoin companies to meet with bankers and regulators, groups usually outside of the networks of most most companies in the Bitcoin community.\nAccording to Carol Van Cleef, a partner at Manatt, Phelps & Phillips and the creator of the boot camp, the event is designed to bring together the various groups.\n\u201cA truly effective AML program cannot be developed in a bubble,\u201d Van Cleef said. \u201cAnd we know that one the biggest benefit for companies attending these programs is meeting the regulators, bankers and law enforcement also attending.\u201d\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t many opportunities for these parties to get together and meet each other in a collaborative environment. Connecting in small working groups at boot camp helps both sides gain a better understanding of what the other has on their plate.\u201d\nVan Cleef knows what she is talking about when it comes to regulatory boot camps. She started the first AML compliance boot camp in 2005 to help the traditional banking industry comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and additional regulatory requirements emerging from the USA Patriot Act passed after 9/11.\nAccording to Van Cleef, many banks and financial institutions were struggling at the time to understand what these laws and regulations required them to do. Banks were increasingly concerned as they watched more and more enforcement actions and civil money penalties being imposed for lax compliance. Van Cleef sees a very similar phenomenon happening within the digital currency industry which is why she thinks this boot camp is critically important for the young industry.\n\u201cNew regulatory requirements can seem overwhelming and even somewhat distant, leaving many companies in the affected industries not interested in compliance. The bootcamp is not just a way to learn how to be compliant but also meet the people who work with the regulations every day.\u201d\nRegulatory Crash Course\nThe event is ideal not only for bitcoin startups just starting to build their AML programs but also for companies with established programs to both benchmark their efforts against others and fine tune their process. During the two day course, Van Cleef and the other course instructor, Maureen Sanders Piccillo, who is a former US Internal Revenue Service\u2019s National AML Program Manager (the unit that examines digital currency companies for compliance with the BSA), will work with exercises that teach participants the necessities of an AML program.\nThere will also be an optional third day, which will be an AML program drafting workshop. According to Van Cleef, participants learn so much in the first days that they are unsure where to start, but the workshop gives attendees a clear game plan to follow.\nParticipants in the class will also be able to receive educational credits for attending. The credits will be issued by the Digital Currency Council and Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists.\nOther sponsors of the event include Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, Tally Capital, MelonDrexel, compliance solution provider IdentityMind Global, the Anti-money Laundering Training Institute and Comptegrity.\nThe New York Cityboot camp is just one of the several educational initiatives the Chamber of Digital Commerce produces. Most recently, the organization sponsored the boot camp at the North American Bitcoin Conference, a large annual event for bitcoin enthusiasts and professionals. The boot camps are part of the industry group\u2019s larger goal to educate government officials, financial professionals and bitcoin startups alike.\n\nThis article was updated to reflect that the Digital Currency Council and Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists are offering continuing education credits only.", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 30}

The new stock exchange could sidestep traditional stock exchanges such as NYSE and NASDAQ and issue corporate stock directly over the Internet.\nOverstock, one of the first and largest online retailers to accept bitcoin payments, first announced the project in October 2014.\n\u201cThere is an opportunity to recreate the financial world as we know it in the parallel universe that is the blockchain,\u201d Overstock\u2019s CEO Patrick Byrne told Wired. \u201cWe are writing rules for this whole new universe. \u201c In a recent Coin Telegraph interview, Byrne said that Overstock is building the platform that will let companies issue a crypto-equity, which is a new frontier with many legal obstacles.\nOn Friday, Overstock got one step closer to implementation. In a prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Overstock indicated that it may issue up to $500 million in stock or other securities using the blockchain technology that powers Bitcoin.\n\u201cWe may decide to offer securities as digital securities, meaning the securities will be uncertificated securities, the ownership and transfer of which are recorded on a cryptographically-secured distributed ledger system using technology similar to (or the same as) the distributed ledger technology used for trading digital currencies,\u201d reads the prospectus. \u201cDigital securities are designed to enable trades to settle immediately or nearly immediately, unlike traditional securities, [and] enable the securities holder to hold its securities directly or through its broker-dealer, outside the system for traditional securities.\u201d\n\u201cThe prospect of using a blockchain-like public ledger to hold securities or other assets is quite exciting and one that should be explored,\u201d Georgetown University professor of finance James Angel told Wired.\nThe hypothetical language used in the filing shows that it is but the first official interaction with the SEC, which may take some time to digest and give a green light to this novel and potentially disruptive approach to securities.\nThe filing is a \u201cshelf registration\u201d meant to introduce future offerings to regulators and investors gradually, with more detailed information expected to come later. However, Overstock\u2019s CEO Patrick Byrne is confident: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have taken all the time and trouble and expense to do this if I didn\u2019t plan on using it someday soon,\u201d he told Wired.\nAngel thinks the SEC will approve the filing eventually, but investors will be initially cautious.\nThe Overstock digital securities would not be listed for trading on existing stock exchanges, but traded exclusively on a specific trading system to be registered with the SEC as an Alternative Trading System (ATS). The prospectus emphasizes that the ATS will operate with the speed and irrevocability appropriate to the immediate or nearly immediate settlement of digital securities, but warns that \u201cthe payment mechanics of the ATS are novel and untested.\u201d\nThe distributed ledger used to record transfers of ownership of digital securities, represented by ledger balances and secured by cryptographic key pairs, will be available to the public and store the complete trading histories.\nThe ATS won\u2019t use a Bitcoin wallet approach where the cryptographic keys are controlled by the user \u2013 at least not initially \u2013 but a centralized key management scheme similar to that used by \u201cBitcoin banks\u201d such as Circle. Initially, either the ATS itself or each broker-dealer participating on that ATS would hold the private keys on behalf of securities holders.\nThis centralized or semi-centralized model, which may appear as a step back from the decentralized blockchain, is justified because it will enable securities holders to manage their digital securities account with a simple login and password, similar to traditional online brokerage accounts.\nThe use of the word \u201cinitially,\u201d however, indicates that Overstock may implement a more decentralized model in a second phase. Customer protection against dishonest brokers will be provided by multisig: \u201cThere can be multiple private keys, any number of which may be required in order to authorize a transfer of ownership of the digital securities,\u201d notes the filing.", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 28}

They\u2019ve actually been very forward-thinking about bitcoin.\u201d\nArmstrong hinted that the exchange might be the most revenue-rich part of the business in Great Britain for a while to come.

In January, investors, including three of the world\u2019s most respected financial institutions \u2013 The New York Stock Exchange, a subsidiary of USAA, and BBVA (NYSE:BBVA) Ventures \u2013\u00a0invested\u00a0$75 million in Coinbase, bringing its total capital to $106 million.\n\u201cWith this investment, we are tapping into a new asset class by teaming up with a leading platform that is bringing transparency, security and confidence to an important growth market,\u201d said NYSE President Tom Farley. \u201cWe look forward to supporting Coinbase\u2019s growth utilizing our global distribution capabilities and market expertise.\u201d\nThe Coinbase exchange launched in January in the United States, and according to Ehrsam, \u201cquickly rose to be the most liquid Bitcoin exchange in the U.S.\u201d\nThe Financial Times\u00a0notes\u00a0that the Coinbase launch in Great Britain is a boost to plans to transform the U.K. into a global hub for bitcoin and digital currencies, with both the government and Bank of England having made recent moves designed to stimulate the development of digital fintech in the United Kingdom.\nFor European users, it\u2019s good to have a solid alternative to Bistamp \u2013 not because Bistamp\u2019s service is not satisfying, but because having more options to choose from is always good. A test revealed that opening and using a new Coinbase account is quick and easy for European Union residents in Great Britain.\nAfter completing email verification, identity verification and phone verification (for two-factor authentication), new customers can start using their Coinbase wallet for bitcoin and euro, and buy or sell bitcoin using the integrated Coinbase exchange.\nThe Coinbase wallet can be funded with bitcoin deposits, or with euro deposits sent via Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) transfer from any E.U. bank. According to Coinbase customer service, European users can withdraw funds from their Coinbase euro wallet to their SEPA bank account, with a delay of one or two business days.\nAt a first glance, the Coinbase European service seems solid and professional, with a simple and intuitive web interface, a community forum for common questions and answers, and responsive customer service. Coinbase also offers a secure vault for long-term bitcoin storage offline, and is fully insured against hacking, theft or loss of customer funds.", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 29}

Essentially, the agreement would lock the price of bitcoin, say $500 / BTC, for a certain amount of time. This way, merchants or miners will be free from the volatility of bitcoin.\nIn correlation to the recent funding round, Hedgy launched a product similar to the concept of the original merchant-targeted smart contracts, this time for miners.\nMiners using the newly launched derivative can initiate smart contracts to agree upon a future price of bitcoin which they wish to sell after a certain amount of time that will be settled on the bitcoin blockchain.\nThe new product of Hedgy is mentored by the founder of MegaBigPower Dave Carlson, who has been working with Hedgy to develop the derivative. The U.S.-based bitcoin mining company MegaBigPower is also the first bitcoin mine to use the derivative. The bitcoin mined from MegaBigPower is purchased by London-based Bitcoin derivatives exchange Crypto Facilities.\n\nHow Hedgy Works\nA bitcoin miner will first \u201chedge\u201d bitcoins at a price of perhaps $250/BTC for 30 days. Then an indicator of Interest is sent to the Hedgy Chat. To initiate in a smart contract, a pre-contract negotiation is made directly with counterparties. Once the terms are agreed upon by the counterparties, the contract is submitted to the Hedge Oracle to create and settle the smart contract.\nAfter the smart contract has been created, a multisig address is generated where the miner and counterparties each deposit at least 30 percent of the BTC to the designated multisig address. As soon as the deposits are confirmed, it goes live on the blockchain, completing the deal.\nHedgy explains that this could help miners deal with increasing electricity costs, hardware obsolescence and fluctuating prices, which are a major problem facing bitcoin mining profitability.\nAs a decentralized brokerage for miners and counterparties, Hedgy could provide miners an effective method of dealing with bitcoin volatility in the future.", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 1}

Ripple was created to enable an Internet of Value in which the world can move value as easily as information moves today.\u201dRipple Labs has long promoted the digital currency\u2019s payment network as a way to improve global payments, and many suspect that the remittance giant could use the digital currency as a way to send money faster and cheaper, though this has not been confirmed.According to a comment made to Bitcoin Magazine by Western Union\u2019s Director of Global Corporate Communications Kristin Kelly, it does appear the remittance giant is interested in using the digital currency for \u201csettlements\u201d but declined to elaborate.\u201cWe have had preliminary discussions with Ripple regarding a pilot settlement project, but it is too early to discuss details at this time,\" Kelly said.\nFinancial Inclusion", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 2}

With this initiative, Tsinghua University joins MIT and technology giants IBM and Samsung as one of the world\u2019s major institutions conducting research and development of blockchain technology, decentralized systems and digital assets.\nFounded in 1911, Tsinghua University is one of the nine elite Chinese universities, and it is considered the top institution of higher learning in mainland China alongside Peking University. It describes itself as being dedicated to academic excellence, the wellbeing of Chinese society and global development. Often described as \u201cthe MIT of China,\u201d Tsinghua was regarded as the top Chinese university by the 2015 Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings, where it was ranked 26th globally.\nThe PBC School of Finance at Tsinghua University was founded in 2012, as a joint venture between the University and the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBC), with the mission of promoting excellence in the finance industry and financial regulation through top-notch education and cutting-edge research. In partnership with the central bank and national financial regulators, the PBC School of Finance established the National Institute of Financial Research (NIFR), with the mission of doing top-class research on financial reform and development, and providing policy analysis and advice for financial policymakers and regulators.\nHuobi is China\u2019s leading Bitcoin company. With financial backing from Silicon Valley investment firm Sequoia Capital, Huobi operates a Bitcoin exchange and provides services to individual and institutional clients. With a 16.34 market share, the Huobi Bitcoin exchange is one of the most active in the world.\nPBC School of Finance Dean Liao Li, PBC School of Finance Vice President and Deputy Party Secretary Zhao Cen, Huobi founder and CEO Li Lin, and other leaders attended the Digital Assets Research Initiative launch event. Li Lin and Liao Li each gave a speech, and Vice President Zhao Cen signed an agreement formalizing the university\u2019s long-term cooperation with Huobi.\nThe work of the Digital Assets Research Initiative will be jointly conducted by finance and technology experts from Tsinghua University PBC School of Finance and Huobi. It will be hosted at the Tsinghua PBC School\u2019s Internet Finance Research Lab and Huobi will be the official sponsor of the program.\nThere are evident parallels between Tsinghua University\u2019s Digital Assets Research Initiative and the MIT Digital Currency Initiative, recently launched by the MIT Media Lab to address some of the most critical challenges to creating a safe, stable and secure digital currency and directed by former White House senior adviser for mobile and data innovation Brian Forde. In both cases, a prestigious university with strong ties with the nation\u2019s technical, financial and political establishments takes the lead in the digital currency space, with funding coming partly from the private sector.\nIt\u2019s important to note that, as revealed by Goldman Sachs\u2019 recent report about the future of money, 80 percent of bitcoin volume is exchanged into and out of Chinese yuan. Therefore, the Digital Assets Research Initiative could influence the positions of the Chinese government on bitcoin and digital currencies.\n\u201cContrary to commonly held belief, the regulatory environment for operating a Bitcoin business in China is actually more accommodating than the United States,\u201d said Huobi product manager Robert Kuhne in a recent interview on CoinReport. \u201cIt can\u2019t be said with absolute certainty what the Chinese government policy will be in the future. It is likely that the government will not do anything until Bitcoin grows significantly. Today, Bitcoin\u2019s total global value is a $4 billion U.S. dollars. This does not appear on the radar of Beijing bureaucrats who are responsible for managing the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 1}

The first quarter of 2015 shows a 54 percent increase of venture capital funding for Bitcoin companies, with the total sum growing from $133 million to $229 million with notable investments in both Coinbase and 21inc.\nAt the Bitcoin Job Fair last week hosted by the Plug and Play Tech Center, the 30 companies represented were focused on attracting and keeping the best talent. The 350 attendees were passionate about Bitcoin, and many of the job seekers were interested in being at least partially compensated in the digital currency. Many of the startups present at the job fair, including BitPay, have international employees and are seeking both domestic and international talent.\nAlthough choices abound for human resources and payroll solutions, the biggest payroll companies with automated services in Silicon Valley such as Zenpayroll and Zenefits have not integrated bitcoin for international payments. Instead, new entrants such as full-enterprise HR solution Zuman and simple payroll services such as Incoin are integrating bitcoin payments to solve central challenges for established and growing businesses.\nThey seek to offer flexible choices, automation and frictionless solutions for companies of all sizes. In addition to addressing common business pain points, they hope to give additional options to savvy tech employees across the world.\nZuman, unlike Zenefits or Zenpayroll, is a full-on enterprise HR solution solution providing services taking care of compliance, tax and legal issues but also combining them with payroll and employee record keeping in one easy to use interface with prices starting per employee. On the other end of the spectrum is Incoin, a lower-cost solution providing automated bitcoin and USD payouts to companies with a U.S. bank account with one low, flat fee. Bitcoin processing for both companies is accomplished through an API provided by BitPay, an international payment processor.\n\u201cIf Bitcoin companies want to retain top talent, taking measures to ensure employee satisfaction is vital,\u201d says BitPay Marketing Manager Emily Vaughn. \u201cReceiving all or a portion of your paycheck in bitcoin is a major benefit for tech talent, and BitPay has partnered with payroll providers to make this easy and affordable for employers.\u201d\n\u201cThrough our partnership with BitPay, we are be able to better help companies that are moving beyond their startup phase attract and retain high-value employees,\u201d says Doug Devlin, CEO of Zuman.\nCompanies such as Incoin and Zuman allow companies to pay domestic and international employees in USD and bitcoin, saving real time and money for startups. They are also helping lead bitcoin adoption by allowing employees to earn bitcoin rather than forcing locals to tap into exchanges.\n\u201cOffers like this are increasingly attractive to people in countries that have a volatile local currency where binding Forex market restrictions are in place and black markets charge unheard of prices, like Argentina\u201d says Tony Holdstock-Brown of Incoin.\nAccording to the New York Times, the official exchange rate for the Argentinian peso can be as much as 40 percent less than the effective, black market rate (the dolar blue). Increasingly, talented and educated Argentinians are trying to buy bitcoin and even trying to earn it.\nBitcoin companies BitPay, BitPagos and Bitex all have opened headquarters in Argentina to take advantage of this demand.\nBeing able to earn in bitcoin lowers the barrier to obtaining bitcoin and also provides opportunities for what 21 Inc.\u2019s Balaji Srivinasan calls \u201cclosed-loop\u201d companies and systems that accept bitcoin as payment for goods and services. Closed-loop systems are growing extremely important in the developing world as venture capital firms incubate companies that allow locals to spend bitcoin for goods and services, such as Purse.io, Zapgo.co, and Bankymoon.\nSrivinasan highlighted a few potential issues in a presentation at the job fair. For example, closed-loop systems may push forward adoption, but adoption could also lead to a depression in the bitcoin price if individuals are forced to go to exchanges to convert bitcoin to spend fiat currency for goods and services.\nThe solution, according to Srivinasan, is to encourage a less volatile and valued bitcoin currency by giving individuals choice to purchase goods and services with digital currencies \u2013 especially in emerging markets such as the developing world.\n\nPhoto by Dave Dugdale / CC BY-SA 2.0", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 4}

Power to the miners.\u201d\nThe new chip is being manufactured by SFARDS, a new company formed from the merger of two other Bitcoin mining companies, Gridseed and WiiBox. Gridseed was a mining chip and hardware manufacturer, while WiiBox developed software and hardware for controlling mining rigs. According to Long, Frank Li is leading the team that is bringing this chip to market.\n\u201cThis chip outperforms everything on the market by about 40 percent, give or take, on the bitcoin side, and about 130 percent on the litecoin side. Plus, you can mine both at the same time,\u201d Long said.\nThe chip requires only 0.331 watts/GH, which is a measure of the electricity required to perform hashing operations. According to Long, this makes the new chip the most efficient ever produced. At the same time it mines bitcoin, the new chip will mine litecoin using 2.9 watts/MH.\nMany companies have attempted to make more advanced, efficient chips, but SFARDS used an experimental technology to reach these levels. According to Long, the company used a process called Fully Depleted Silicon on Insulator, otherwise known as FDSOI.\nWhile most chips are made entirely on silicon, this process allows for alternating layers of silicon and silicon dioxide. Long explained that this \u201callows you to take a design and, with no alterations in the design ,use this manufacturing process to keep the power consumption to a minimum.\u201d\nWhile it works in theory, no manufacturer has been able to do this method at scale, a fact Long admitted was a concern for SFARDS. \u201cHowever, the 100 sample chips I saw were flawless,\u201d he said. Long visited the SFARDS production facility in Beijing to test the chip in person and pick up some development boards.\nSFARDS aims to release two production units. The first is a single chip USB miner for the average consumer who wants to experiment with mining. The second is a 16- or 24-chip full miner that is meant for enthusiasts and large-scale mining operations. Further, SFARDS plans to ship 50 development boards next week to developers who will be able to tweak the hardware to try to create an even more efficient chip.\nAccording to Long, the optimal setting to run the chip is at 0.062V, which allows each chip to reach the capacity of 100GH/s, coming out to the 0.331 watts/GH. Long explained that he tested the chip in an open environment which enabled the chip to remain around 49.2 degrees Celsius; however, he admitted that in an enclosed environment the heat might be much greater.\nBecause this chip can mine both bitcoin and litecoin simultaneously, there are two sides to it. On the bitcoin side, it has 160 processing cores, while on the litecoin side, it has 125 processing cores. It also has on-chip RAM.\nIs There Demand?\nThe mining industry has shrunken dramatically over the past six months due to the low price of bitcoin. On January 1, 2015, cloud mining company and GHash.IO mining pool operator CEX.IO announced that it was temporarily\u00a0suspending cloud mining operations due to the bitcoin price drop. As the price has fallen lower, electricity costs and mining efficiency has become an even more important factor for miners. However, a new generation of high-efficiency chips, including this one from SFARDS, is in development.\n\u201cI have personally already talked to many major farms, and many are excited,\u201d Long said. \u201cSFARDS is being cautious, and batch one will be produced only in a quantity of around three petahash. And they will limit each customer to a small amount so everyone can try it out. However, big farms will be allowed towards mid-summer to order in bulk.\u201d\nDue to the chip being in the final PCB design phase, Long wasn\u2019t yet sure what the price for the chip would be. He did say, however, that the price would be competitive and that, \u201cI personally expect the first miners to be finished and ready to be shipped in under one month\u2019s time from today.\u201d\nWhen it does launch, FinalHash, Dual Miner, and a few other distributors will be allowed to sell both units.", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 4}

The difficulty of proof of work and the computing power required make bitcoin special and very rare and therefore very valuable.\nThis concept of proof of work is integral not only to bitcoin but also applies to many facets of life. Anything worth having or accomplishing takes work, as the old saying goes. Health and fitness is no exception to this rule. Consistent habits can create an amazing body and health.\nThe proof of your workout is clear when you have great biceps. The only way you get those biceps is through a dedication to your goal and by holding yourself accountable.\nBitPay, Bitcoin Magazine, ChangeTip and the Chamber of Digital Commerce have teamed up to sponsor a 30-day challenge to encourage fitness and health. These organizations want to mobilize their decentralized community to take up a positive challenge, hold accountability and inspire via social media tools such as ChangeTip. Getting to your goals will be made even sweeter with prizes.\nPsychologists say it takes 5 days to create a habit and 21 days to cement one. Emily Vaughn of BitPay has experience joining social fitness campaigns, which encourage members to share their progress and health and fitness tips daily. When discussing parody April Fools Day Bitcoin projects with the marketing team at BitPay, the moniker \u201cproof of workout\u201d was born, and thus the idea of a social fitness campaign that encourages participants to prove their work and get results.\nAfter starting the paleo diet and joining a Facebook group for local paleo dieters, she realized that sharing the ups-and-downs of a health and fitness challenge created social accountability and resulted a true lifestyle change, a success that is difficult to achieve when you go it alone. So she dreamed up #ProofOfWorkout, a 30-day health and fitness challenge. The goals of the challenge are to use fitness to educate about the social and transformative properties of Bitcoin technology, and to mobilize the Bitcoin community towards a common goal \u2013 getting fit. She designed the challenge to make it accessible to anyone. She plans to use the proof-of-work concept herself, to hack her way to better habit and eventually great fitness and inspire others to do so as well.\nJoin the Challenge!\nSimply sign up on the #ProofOfWorkout website with your email, tell us your goal, and then start posting to social media with #ProofOfWorkout so we can track your goals and connect you with like-minded people. Signups begin today and the challenge starts on Monday, May 11th. After 30 days, the contest concludes on June 9th. Winners will be announced on Friday, June 12th. #ProofOfWorkout hopes to award five $100 Nike Gyft cards to the most engaged and enthusiastic participants.\nJoin the #ProofOfWorkout challenge and prove your work with a strong body and a healthy mind.

It was discovered by Bitcoin security firm BlockTrail over the weekend.\nBlockTrail CTO Ruben De Vries first encountered the issue while conducting analysis on the blockchain, \u201cfor our own internal purposes.\u201d He found a group of addresses had the same output, allowing them to be tracked. De Vries identified it as the change address, that is the address created to send any remaining bitcoin leftover from a transaction.\n\u201cIf one is able to correlate trends in deposits and withdraws to the price movement (for example, maybe a high velocity of BTC deposits might indicate upcoming sell pressure, uncovering big sellers, etc), then so long as this data was not in common knowledge, it could be greatly valuable to traders. But just like looking for a good domain name, you often enough find that someone smart was there before you \u2013 and so I am left wondering not if such information is already being used by traders with informational advantages, but rather to what extent,\u201d wrote BlockTrail CEO Boaz Becher in a company blog post.\nThe Change Bug\nAccording to Becher, the company was able to get an \u201cinteresting picture\u201d of the BitStamp\u2019s activity, including deposits, withdrawals and volume, by exploiting this issue. The company submitted a proposed fix to BitGo\u2019s API implementation over the weekend but the fix still had not been implemented by BitGo as of Tuesday morning.\nAccording to a comment posted online by BitGo CTO Ben Davenport, the Bitcoin API provider has been aware of this issue for a while and has not changed it yet because they \u201cdon\u2019t consider it a huge deal.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call this a bug, per se, but it\u2019s a known issue that we plan to fix,\u201d Davenport said. \u201cThe BitGo API is agnostic where the change output(s) are placed \u2013 this is just an issue with the client-side SDK.\n\u201cThe primary reason we haven\u2019t changed it sooner is that BitGoD (which Bitstamp uses), currently relies on the change output being last to determine which output of a transaction is change when listing transactions,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis was needed due to missing functionality in our back-end transaction indexer which has been remedied in the last few weeks.\u201d\nThe other reason this issue is not a bigger deal is because it is already easy to identify the exchange\u2019s change address. BitGo makes the exchange\u2019s wallets multi-sig and makes the output end with a \u201c3.\u201d Since adoption of multi-sig is still low, it is already fairly easy to identify the exchange\u2019s addresses.\nBitGo Security\nThis is the second bug found in BitGo\u2019s API in the past week. Over the weekend, a Reddit user going by the user name, rstn, claimed to have lost 85 bitcoin when transferring 116 bitcoin with BitGo\u2019s Legacy Wallet Recovery Tool. The erroneous tool made the transaction\u2019s miner fee 85 bitcoin instead of the usual fractions of a bitcoin according to the user.\nBitGo acted quickly and contacted AntPool, the mining pool that processed the transaction and had the bitcoin returned to the user in full. As part of the company\u2019s ongoing bug bounty program, the BitGo has since fixed the bug and rewarded the user 25 extra bitcoin for bringing it to their attention.\nThe security of BitGo\u2019s API remains intact, and its clients are insured by the A-rated XL Group for $250,000 of losses in the case of a hack or theft.\n\nPhoto by Marko Ahtisaari / CC BY 2.0", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 5}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nEarlier today, Ripple Labs Inc. was fined $700,000 for \u201cwillfully violating several requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).\u201d The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) stated that the company issued its own currency (XRP) and failed to implement adequate anti-money laundering measures, in addition to operating as a money services business without the proper authorization from the federal regulatory body. FinCEN worked with the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California to coordinate the civil money penalty against Ripple Labs Inc and XRP II, LLC, which is owned by Ripple Labs.\nSale of XRP to Roger Ver\nA statement of facts included in FinCEN\u2019s assessment of the violations describes multiple situations where XPR II \u201cfailed to file, or untimely filed, suspicious activity reports.\u201d One such scenario involved noted bitcoin entrepreneur and evangelist Roger Ver. The report alleges that Ver purchased $250,000 worth of XRP from XRP II without filling out a KYC (know your customer) form. The report notes:\n\u201cOn September 30, 2013, XRP II negotiated an approximately $250,000.00 transaction by email for a sale of XRP virtual currency with [Roger Ver]. XRP II provided [Ver] with a \u2018know your customer\u2019 (\u2018KYC\u2019) form and asked that it be returned along with appropriate identification in order to move forward with the transaction. [Ver] replied that another source would provide the XRP virtual currency and did not \u2018require anywhere near as much paperwork\u2019 and essentially threatened to go elsewhere. Within hours, XRP II agreed by email to dispense with its KYC requirement and move forward with the transaction.\u201d\nImplications for the Ripple protocol going forward\nThis course of action from FinCEN could have implications for the level of anonymity offered by Ripple in the future. In fact, \u201cenhancements to [the] Ripple protocol\u201d are outlined in a document explaining an agreement by Ripple Labs and XRP II to ensure compliance with AML/CFT obligations. The report states:\n\u201cWithin 60 days, Ripple Labs, XRP II, and the Ripple Trade MSB will improve, and upon request provide any information requested by FinCEN or the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office as to the use and improvement of, existing analytical tools applicable to the Ripple protocol, including: (1) reporting regarding any counterparty using the Ripple protocol; (2) reporting as to the flow of funds within the Ripple protocol; and (3) reporting regarding the degree of separation.\u201d\nThe document also explains how AML transaction monitoring will be implemented across the entire Ripple protocol:\n\u201cRipple Labs will institute AML programmatic transaction monitoring across the entire Ripple protocol, and will report the results of such monitoring to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, FinCEN, and any other law enforcement or regulatory agency 4 upon request. The monitoring and reporting must include, at a minimum: (a) risk rating of accounts based on the particular gateway used; (b) dynamic risk tools to facilitate investigation of suspicious activity, including counterparty reporting, flow of funds reporting, account flagging of suspicious accounts, and degrees of separation reporting; and (c) other reports of protocol-wide activity regarding any unlawful activity.\u201d\nDecentralized software vs distributed transaction ledgers\nThis action against Ripple Labs from FinCEN will undoubtedly be used by bitcoin proponents as proof that proof-of-work-powered, decentralized solutions (such as bitcoin) are still necessary. The course of action taken by FinCEN may be used as proof that the regulatory body will go after any point of failure in a distributed ledger system when complete decentralization is not achieved. This is not to say that Ripple can no longer provide value to its users; however, the fact that bitcoin and Ripple are to be used for different use cases should now be as clear as ever.", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 6}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nOne of the main issues that has slowed the adoption of Bitcoin as a currency and payment system has been the complexity of Bitcoin addresses.\nThe blockchain lacks the human-friendly names normally found with websites and email addresses, which can make sending payments a rather cumbersome process. Netki wants to help people move away from confusing Bitcoin addresses, such as 15eA82FZLogpSb8nkQ5h5qaF3QNEwSeyCm, toward human-readable names such as kyletorpey.tip.me.\nAny bitcoin user would be able to send bitcoin to anyone else as easily as a Gmail user can send an email to someone using a web browser.\nHow Does it Work?\nNetki uses a combination of the Namecoin blockchain and Secure DNS (DNSSEC) to take care of name storage and mapping between a name and an address.\n\u201cYour base records reside in the Namecoin blockchain proving ownership, and allowing for full, censor-proof control,\u201d Netki CEO Justin Newton explained via email. \u201cThe actual wallet name-to-address lookups occur on standard DNS records secured and authenticated using DNSSEC.\n\u201cThis combination of decentralized and distributed [solutions] provides the control and ownership of the blockchain along with the privacy of keeping your name to address mapping off of a public ledger,\u201d Newton said.\nThe Netki CEO also explained that wallet providers will be able to hand out names in a manner similar to how email addresses are handed out to Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo and other online mail providers. He specifically mentioned ChangeTip\u2019s use of the tip.me domain as an example of this feature.\nNewton was also able to share his thoughts on the differences between Netki and another Bitcoin name system, OneName:\n\u201cWe believe that a lot of what OneName is doing is really fantastic. There is a need for a decentralized way to validate your social identity, and their roadmap feature of using signatures instead of passwords for logins is excellent and long overdue. We do believe, however, that tying your identity to your wallet address on a public ledger negates the possibility of privacy on the blockchain. For us, making it easy to share your address with anyone without having to publish it to everyone is one of the keys to our service. We\u2019d love to see OneName support Wallet Names where they currently support bitcoin addresses.\u201d\nA Problem for Privacy?\nThe obvious question when talking about name-mapping systems for digital currencies is what it will mean for user privacy. After all, privacy and anonymity are still desirable features for a large number of bitcoin users.\nNewton said the protection of privacy was also a concern for Netki, but he added that the use of HD wallets \u201callows the return of a unique address every time.\u201d\nNetki also supports Payment Requests, which are sometimes referred to as the \u201cSSL for wallet addresses.\u201d\nNewton explained that the integration of Payment Requests will allow users to see a green lock next to an address in the \u201cTo\u201d field of a Bitcoin wallet. That lock helps users confirm that they\u2019re sending bitcoin to the correct individual, organization, or company. This process is similar to the green lock found next to website URLs that have been secured via SSL and an HTTPS connection.\n\u201cThe combination of HD Wallets and Payment Requests with Wallet Names increases the privacy and security of sending bitcoin, while at the same time making it more user friendly and reassuring to end users,\u201d Newton said.\nAn example of this system can be seen in the video below:\n\nIn addition to ChangeTip, Netki has also partnered with Gem, Snapcard, Purse.io, ShapeShift, BitQuick, Coinprism, Fold App, and many other companies in the Bitcoin space.", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 22}

The exchange was hacked just weeks prior to the announcement, which caused users\u2019 passwords and two-factor authentication secrets to be compromised.\nBitspark is a Hong Kong-based exchange and remittance company that has recently announced a new round of funding. They are the first company in the world to offer end-to-end bitcoin remittances and were recently featured in Goldman Sachs\u2019 report The Future of Finance.\nBitspark offers two major services: an exchange and a remittance service. The exchange supports 18 currency pairs and five fiat currencies. The remittance service works in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Indonesia and Australia.\nPrior scandals surrounding previous Bitcoin exchanges such as MtGox and Cavitrex make security a huge priority for Bitspark.\n\u201cWhen we think about the next generation of Bitcoin technology, Bitspark is exactly the kind of product that gets us excited,\u201d said Brennen Byrne, CEO of Clef. \u201cIt is absolutely critical that we find ways to make Bitcoin useful to more people, and I\u2019m excited that Clef can help make that happen.\u201d\nBitspark chose Clef because of how easy it is to use. Typically, sites that offer two-factor authentication see less than 1 percent of users opt in to protect their accounts, but sites that use Clef have seen more than 50 percent of their users opt in to the safer login. Two-factor authentication \u2013 or \u20182FA\u2019 \u2013 is a simple feature that asks for more than just a user\u2019s password. To make login seamless, Clef recognizes a user\u2019s phone instead of anything he or she needs to remember or type.\nInstead of storing secrets in a central server like other forms of two-factor authentication, Clef is a distributed system for logging in. Private keys are generated and stored on the user\u2019s phone. Nothing secret ever needs to be sent to Clef and therefore no 2FA secrets would be compromised.\n\u201cFrom the first time I saw someone log in with Clef, I knew that this was the future of logging in,\u201d said George Harrap, CEO of Bitspark. \u201cOur whole team got excited about the technology, and the integration was really quick.\u201d\nA New Kind of Security\nTraditional 2FA requires a user to have two types of credentials before being able to log into an account. 2FA typically asks the users to confirm that it is in fact them trying to access the account.\nExamples of this include:\nPIN or password sent via textphone call giving a codefingerprint\n2FA security is far from 100 percent secure, as illustrated with the Cavitrex 2FA factor security breach. To hack an account protected by two-factor authentication, hackers must gain access to the physical feature being sent (PIN sent via text to mobile phone). According to CNET, the second way a hacker can gain access through 2FA is by gaining access to the \u201ccookies or tokens placed one the device by the authenticator.\u201d\n2FA is not perfect, but it is certainly more secure than a single-factor authentication. 2FA is likely to become the norm, followed by 3FA or 4FA.\nHere is how Clef security improves upon the 2FA model: Customers can log into Bitspark on any computer in the world by holding their phones up to a computer screen. Using the phone\u2019s camera and an animation called the \u201cClef Wave,\u201d the phone seamlessly syncs with the computer and logs the user in.\nThe process already protects about 50,000 sites and is backed by cryptography. Instead of storing secrets in a central server like other forms of two-factor authentication, Clef is a distributed system for logging in. Private keys are generated and stored on the user\u2019s phone.\nBy taking advantage of the rapid spread of mobile devices, Clef has built technology that is not only much more secure than traditional logins, but also easier to use. Since 2013, Clef has spread to more than 46,000 sites and received accolades from The New York Times, Inc. Magazine and The Economist.\nClef is funded by Morado Ventures and angel investors from a broad variety of product and security backgrounds.", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 22}

(the exclamation mark is part of the name) is the second-most-popular social network after Facebook and one of the main destinations in the Latin American Web. The social network, whose slogan is \u201cCollective Intelligence,\u201d is a hybrid of Facebook and Reddit, offering a crowdsourced social bookmarking and commenting platform similar to Reddit.\n\u201cToday we are launching Taringa! Creators, a revolutionary program that allows Taringa! users to receive a monetary compensation for the valuable content they share in our community,\u201d announces Taringa! (in Spanish). \u201cThis is a super innovative project, because we will pay in bitcoin: the new virtual currency that works without banks or governments and allows paying via Internet without a credit card or a bank account, instantly and without transaction costs. For that, we signed an agreement with the company Xapo, founded by Argentine entrepreneur Wenceslao Casares, based in Silicon Valley, which offers the virtual Bitcoin wallets where we will transfer the money earned by you, which you will be able to use as you prefer.\u201d\nOffering a financial compensation to those who dedicate part of their time to power the social networks that are an increasingly important part of everyone\u2019s online life is certainly revolutionary but also overdue, and bitcoin payments are an ideal implementation. Perhaps other social networks such as Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter will follow.\n\u201cXapo\u2019s partnership with Taringa! implements the largest bitcoin integration the community has yet to see and is a historic moment for both bitcoin and social media,\u201d notes the Xapo announcement. \u201cTop content creators can now earn bitcoin through Taringa!\u2019s Revenue Sharing Program, rewarding users who bring quality content to Taringa!. The platform is supported by a simple one-click integration with Xapo\u2019s secure bitcoin wallet.\u201d\nThe initiative is likely to will have a huge impact on Taringa!\u2019s user base, largely under-banked despite having access to smartphones and Internet, and could introduce millions of people across the globe to the benefits of Bitcoin. According to Xapo, the partnership has the potential to quadruple the current number of bitcoin transactions worldwide.\nThe traditional payment infrastructure couldn\u2019t support Taringa!\u2019s plans to reward its loyal users for content shared on the social network, and therefore Taringa! had to look for alternatives. Latin America\u2019s \u201chorrendous,\u201d underdeveloped financial system made it impossible to deliver funds, said Taringa!\u2019s co-owner Hern\u00e1n Botbol. Credit-card networks aren\u2019t developed enough and bank account penetration isn\u2019t deep enough for users to receive payments in their traditional currencies.\n\u201cWe have had this on our mind, mainly because we think we can bring more people to create great content and also because we think that it\u2019s fair, given that all this that we have is just because our users are creating the content,\u201d said Botbol. \u201cBut we never were able to do that because the infrastructure is horrendous \u2013 even if you send someone a check, they don\u2019t know what to do with that.\u201d\nThe Wall Street Journal notes that the initiative, which exploits bitcoin where the traditional financial system is unable to deliver, could be an impetus for wider adoption in the developing world, where many believe digital currencies have their best chance of success.", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 22}

ING asked participants about mobile banking, payments and digital currency, such as bitcoin.\nThe report has some sobering insights into how Bitcoin adoption is going in the West, including what consumers see as the biggest benefits and problems of mobile payments.\n1. People Are Using Less Cash\nAccording to European consumers, cash is on its way out. When asked if their use of cash has declined over the last year, 50 percent of European participants said yes. And out of the group who answered yes, 80 percent think that trend will continue throughout the next year. 50 percent in Australia and 54 percent in the United States felt that their use of cash had declined over the past year as well.\nAustria and Germany had the lowest percentage of people thinking they were using less cash, with only 31 percent saying yes. Turkey, Poland and Italy had the highest, with 60 percent or above saying they were using less.\n2. Trust is the biggest barrier\nForty-two percent of European survey participants who have not used a mobile payment app say, \u201cI don\u2019t trust it\u201d is the biggest reason. Trust was closely followed by \u201cNot yet having an opportunity to use it\u201d, which got 41 percent. Following were \u201cI don\u2019t understand it\u201d at 10 percent, \u201cIt\u2019s no easier\u201d at 9 percent and \u201cIt\u2019s more difficult to track what I spend\u201d at 8 percent.\nParticipants who had mobile payment apps were asked whom they trusted the most to make mobile payment apps. \u201cMy bank\u201d came in first with a whopping 81 percent. Named groups (Google, Apple, etc.) came in with just 5 percent, while social media websites (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) got 4 percent. Only 2 percent of participants said other banks.\n3. Is Bitcoin the future of payments?\nThe majority of participants in the Netherlands, Luxembourg, United Kingdom, Germany and Austria said no. And 72 percent of participants across Europe either said they didn\u2019t have an opinion or no. Australia and the United States fared slightly better, with less than half disagreeing.\nHowever, 45 percent of Turkish respondents answered Bitcoin was the future of payments. Turkey scored the highest and was followed up with Italy at 43 percent and Spain at 33 percent.\nThese countries also had the highest number of people who have used the digital currency in the last 12 months (as you will read next).\n4. Bitcoin awareness still low, but users are believers\nDespite media hype and regularly making headlines, many Europeans still don\u2019t know what Bitcoin even is and only tiny portion have actually used it. When European participants were asked whether if in the past 12 months they had used digital currency, 24 percent responded no, 49 percent responded they had no idea what it was, and only 4 percent responded that they had.\nFifty-two percent of Australian participants responded that they don\u2019t what Bitcoin is and 43 percent from the United States responded similarly.\nTurkey had the highest percentage of people who have used the cryptocurrency, with 9 percent responding yes. Italy and the United States tied for second with 7 percent. Poland was third with 6 percent, and Spain came in fourth with 5 percent.\nThe European countries with the highest amount of cryptocurrency users were also the countries with higher percentages of people who believed it was the future of payments.\n5. Non-Bitcoin mobile payments are winning\nWhile mobile payments as a whole remain niche and nonmainstream, it seems Bitcoin is losing to more conventional mobile payment apps created by banks and financial technology (fintech) startups. While countries such Turkey and the United States had more than 60 percent of participants saying they are using mobile banking apps in the last 12 months, none of the countries had more than 10 percent of people who had previously used Bitcoin.\nThe study shows mobile payments as a whole are growing, and the countries with the highest adoption of mobile banking and payments also tend to have the highest percentage of people who had used and believe in Bitcoin.\nYou can read the survey\u2019s findings for yourself here (download).", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 23}

The government of the tiny island is pushing forward a new regulatory framework to create a true paradise for digital currencies.\nBitcoin Magazine\u00a0spoke\u00a0with\u00a0Brian Donegan, Head of Operations for Digital Development and eBusiness at the Isle of Man Department of Economic Development. Donegan confirmed that the island, a self-governing British Crown dependency located in the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Ireland, is gearing up to become the ideal environment for digital financial technology businesses, entrepreneurs and developers.\n\u201cThe Isle of Man is investment-grade and has the perfect business environment to maximize value,\u201d said Donegan. \u201cThe Isle of Man has a superior technology proposition, excellent bandwidth, Tier 3 Data Centers and self-sufficient local electricity power supplies.\u201d\nDonegan confirmed that, besides the advantages of political stability and a world-class computing and telecom infrastructure, the Isle of Man government intends to offer to digital fintech businesses a clear, rock-solid regulatory environment to foster good business models \u2013 and keep dubious ones out.\n\u201cWe will keep crime out and protect the consumer,\u201d he said.Two relevant pieces of legislation, the \u201cDesignated Businesses (Registration and Oversight) Bill 2014\u201d and the \u201cProceeds of Crime (Business in the Regulated Sector) Order 2015,\u201d are advancing through the approval process and should enter in force in a few weeks.\nA decade ago the Isle of Man government recognized e-gaming as a potential strategic growth sector, and established a suitable legal and fiscal framework to attract online gambling and sports betting businesses. As a result, leading operators such as PokerStars flocked to the island and today are an important part of the thriving e-business sector, which accounts for around 19 percent of the Isle of Man economy.According to Donegan, the government now wants to re-use the same \u201cFreedom to Flourish\u201d approach for Bitcoin and digital fintech, and will make efforts to attract and welcome not only Bitcoin 1.0 businesses focused on blockchain-based financial transactions, but also new Bitcoin 2.0 companies that leverage the technology of the blockchain to address other business opportunities.\nDonegan edits an e-business blog on the aptly titled \u201cWhere You Can\u201d Isle of Man government website. In the latest post, he notes that a powerful blockchain cluster has emerged with some dynamic start-ups in the Isle of Man.\n\u201cThe recent surge in crypto 2.0 businesses is clear evidence that an Isle of Man blockchain cluster is also on its way,\u201d he says. \u201cThis cluster effect creates a formidable peer group of experts that can share their combined knowledge, expertise and resources to the overall economic benefit of the Isle of Man.\u201d Donegan adds that he has been working with various companies in this highly innovative sector to ensure that they have the support and assistance needed to get started on the Isle of Man.\nBlockchain entrepreneurs can move to the Isle of Man and take advantage of interesting financial and fiscal incentives. Alternatively, they can stay where they are and set up a virtual Isle of Man corporation through local registered agents and non-executive directors. The Department of Economic Development can assist in the process, and may also be able to provide introductions to local investors and venture capital companies for funding.", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 24}

Sending faxes is difficult because almost nobody has a fax machine at home anymore, and going to a post office seems a waste of time to those accustomed to living at Internet speed.\nThere are, of course, Internet fax services that allow using a PC connected to the Internet to send and receive faxes. But Internet fax services require a subscription, which can be expensive. For example eFax.com, probably the best-known Internet fax service, charges $17 a month for a basic subscription, plus 10 centers per page after the first 150 pages. That seems far too expensive, since most people don\u2019t need to send more than one or two faxes per year.\nReasonably priced pay-as-you-go plans without subscriptions would be ideal for sending faxes when the need arises, but the overhead costs of traditional payment systems make that difficult to implement. The problem is that paying costs money \u2013 bank wires, credit card payments, and even PayPal have fixed transaction costs. If sending a fax over the Internet costs, say, half-a-dollar, it doesn\u2019t make sense to pay one dollar to cover transaction costs. Therefore, most Internet fax service providers use subscription-based pricing, but buying a subscription doesn\u2019t make sense to casual users.\nBitcoin Fax has now entered the market as a new Internet fax service that allows sending faxes anywhere in the world with no sign-up required. Australian developer Simon Males announced the service on Reddit saying, \u201cThought I would support the Bitcoin economy by helping those who still need to send faxes from time to time.\u201d Many posts to the Reddit discussion are enthusiastic.\nThe user interface is very simple: The user needs only to enter a fax number anywhere in the world, upload a PDF document, and send. Payment is in bitcoin, with fees that range from 11 cents USD to send faxes to Japan to $7.58 to send faxes to places such as Afghanistan. Most countries in Europe and the Americas are priced at 17 cents per fax.\nAccording to user feedback on Reddit, the service works well, and sends faxes a few minutes after the payment has been sent.\nBitcoin Fax seems a very good Bitcoin business model. The developer has identified a simple need and a market \u2013 the casual users who still need to send faxes every now and then \u2013 and provided a solution based on a unique advantage of bitcoin payments \u2013 fast and cheap micropayments.\nIn a recent blog post, Coinbase offered ideas for Bitcoin micropayments applications and business models.\nInternet pioneers such as Ted Nelson, Marc Andreessen and Tim Berners-Lee thought that the Internet should have a built-in framework for micropayments. Berners-Lee tried to include micropayments in Web protocols, but the idea was never implemented. Now Bitcoin provides an ideal framework for Internet micropayments, which enables new, simple and efficient business models.", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 24}

A better idea, in fact, than virtually any alleged \u201cexpert\u201d could give you.\nIt would work as follows: A market would be opened in which possible answers to the question (yes or no) are \u201cstocks\u201d that cost anywhere from 1 cent to $1. Automatically, the market price of the \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d would reflect the possibility of Clinton\u2019s election. So if a share of \u201cyes, Clinton will be elected\u201d costs 63 cents, then the likelihood of her being elected can be understood as 63 percent.\nThe option worth more (yes or no) is probably the right answer.\nSince humans care about their money, this market data can provide accurate aggregated information for a myriad of purposes.\nThis is called a prediction market, a market where investors can buy and sell predictions about the outcome of an event.\nRobin Hanson, Ph.D., professor at George Mason University, was one of the first people to start writing about prediction markets in 1988 and has been working on related projects ever since.\n\u201cPrediction markets became more popular around the dot-com boom,\u201d says Hanson. \u201cPresently, there\u2019s been more activity in it.\u201d\nThere\u2019s been more enthusiasm for prediction markets in academia than in industry.\n\u201cAcademics have been more willing to test the market\u2019s claims, while businesses are less eager to adopt them \u2013 regardless of the fact that repeated trials tend to find that they are more accurate than status quo mechanisms,\u201c says Hanson.\n\u201cFor example,\u201d he said, \u201csome of the most dramatic and successful prediction markets have been about deadlines. The question has been stated as: Will this project make its deadline? There are number of dramatic cases where management and officials forecast \u2018yes\u2019 and the prediction market data reveals that the answer is in fact \u2018no.\u2019 It\u2019s not necessarily information organizations want to make publicized. This is the main barrier to widespread adoption of prediction markets: demand. Not enough people in these organizations want the product that prediction markets claim to produce.\n\u201cPrediction markets,\u201d continues Hanson, \u201cclaim to produce uniquely accurate estimates and provide more accurate data than can be acquired from anywhere else. They\u2019re a relatively cheap, robust manipulation; they\u2019re timely, precise; they give you the tools necessary if you needed information and you wanted to make it known to people in an organization.\u201d\nPast implementations of prediction markets on the Internet did not succeed in the long-term. The most popular was Intrade.com.\nIntrade.com, based in Ireland, was a web-based \u201ctrading exchange\u201d where users \u201ctraded\u201d contracts on the probabilities of various events occurring. They even allowed users to speculate on gold and oil.\nIn 2012, however, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission [USCFTC] filed a complaint in federal court claiming that Intrade solicited American customers to trade investment contracts that technically are options. Options can be traded only on approved, regulated exchanges.\nSince Intrade was not a licensed exchange, they were forced to exclude U.S. users in 2012, and on March 10, 2013, Intrade ceased all trading.\n\u201cIntrade was a place where users got a chance to prove themselves and bet,\u201d says Hanson. \u201cThat product, however, was limited by anti-gambling laws.\u201d\nIn 2015, like many other industries, businesses and software models, prediction markets are now being implemented on blockchain technology. There is a dedicated team of individuals building what will be the world\u2019s first decentralized prediction market platform that goes by the name Augur.\nAugur plans to allow users to create their own peer-to-peer prediction markets.\n\u201cThe important thing here,\u201d says Jack Peterson, core developer at Augur, \u201cis that it is a decentralized system. There\u2019s no single point of failure.\u201d\nThe Augur team is fully aware of past struggles of centralized prediction markets. \u201cWe\u2019re making software,\u201d says Peterson. \u201cWe expect the user to follow their respective jurisdiction\u2019s laws. Our whole team has a stipulation in their employment agreement to not create, or participate in, markets on the platform.\u201d\nRegarding the upcoming software token sale, Peterson stated: \u201cAugur\u2019s tokens (called Reputation) occupy a unique niche. They are not used in its prediction markets; these are cash markets. Rather, the tokens are used only to report on the outcomes of events, after the events occur. Since this reporting is done after the event happens, no skill at making predictions is required. All that is required is honesty: Augur is designed so that those who report honestly will automatically gain more tokens \u2013 at the expense of lazy or dishonest reporters.\u201d\nAugur has maintained day-to-day contact with attorneys from Wilson & Sosini and Pillsbury Winthrop throughout the development of their platform. Additionally, they\u2019ll be having a token sale in June. The team is currently finishing up the first version of their software.\n\u201cWe want to launch Augur as soon as Ethereum is ready to make sure that everything is in sync with the live network,\u201d Peterson said.\nPrediction markets have a clean argument for their use and consistently pass tests of accuracy and user satisfaction. Nevertheless, most organizations are not interested in using them.\nWhen Bitcoin Magazineasked Hanson why he thought this occurred, he replied, \u201cIt seems to be that the information that they provide is threatening and problematic, politically.\u201d\nThese prediction markets can provide information that is detrimental to the status quo, and, in simpler terms, tell people/organizations things that they don\u2019t want to hear.\n\u201cDo we really want the capability to do that?\u201d Hanson asked. \u201cA lot of people think they do. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see if it\u2019s true.\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 27}

Lorien Gamaroff, founder and CEO of Bankymoon, is expected to give another presentation on May 14 at the Bitcoin Conference in Prague.\nModern \u201csmart grids\u201d permit efficient management of supply and demand, with Internet-connected \u201csmart meters\u201d that react to changing conditions and can be topped in real-time in case of need. According to Gamaroff, by 2023 most power grids will be smart: 80 percent of the grids in the United States, 60 percent in Europe and 45 percent in the Asia Pacific region.\n\u201cYou\u2019d think that with all the smartness happening in our grid, that the problems are solved,\u201d said Gamaroff. \u201cBut, in fact, this brings us to the most difficult and biggest problem of all, which is payments. Your grid could be as smart as you like but if all customers aren\u2019t paying, it\u2019s worthless and it becomes unsustainable and will collapse.\u201d\nBankymoon, founded in 2015, specializes in deep integration of bitcoin payments into current processes.\n\u201cThe power of bitcoin lies in the ability to program functionality to automatically respond to payment transactions,\u201d notes the Bankymoon website. \u201cUnlike bank accounts, Bitcoin addresses can be monitored by predefined processes which can trigger automated actions. These actions can form part of a workflow which will only proceed once Bitcoin transaction has been detected.\u201d\nBankymoon\u2019s smart meters have their own Bitcoin addresses. When a smart meter receives a Bitcoin payment, Bankymoon calculates the tariff and then loads the meter. Bankymoon\u2019s integration of Bitcoin payments into smart metering systems for modern grids allows users to \u201csend\u201d electricity, water and gas to anybody else in the world, from anywhere, by topping their utility meters.\n\u201cImagine a student abroad who needs to have their meter topped up,\u201d said Gamaroff. \u201cThey\u2019d phone their parent and ask them to send money. The parent now doesn\u2019t have to remit anything.

Other witnesses included the Bitcoin Alliance, Bitcoin Strategy Group, CAVirtex, BitAccess, and Rodger Voorhies from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\nRepresenting the Bitcoin Foundation Canada, lawyers Jillian Friedman and Joseph Neudorfer told the senators that regulating Bitcoin was already happening with the current laws that govern fraud, money laundering and illegal purchases.\nThe two lawyers told the senators that existing criminal law and financial services law is sufficient to deal with fraud. And Bitcoin businesses already are subject to private contract law and consumer protection laws that deal with the sale of a good.\nFrancis Pouliot explained how money-laundering fears are overstated because Bitcoin is mistakenly seen as completely anonymous, when, in actuality, every transaction is recorded in a public ledger called the blockchain.\nMichael Perklin of the Bitcoin Alliance summarized what other advocates were saying: \u201cWe advocate an approach that does not stifle innovation, does not discriminate against cryptocurrencies and takes careful notice of crypto\u2019s benefits to Canadian consumers and merchants alike.\u201d\nMost witnesses made the point that the federal government has an obligation to balance any new regulations with their effect on innovation and capital flight. The government has a mandate to promote new technologies and homegrown startups, not tie them up with red tape, they said.\nThese Laws Currently Apply to Digital Currencies in Canada\nThe Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s testimony included a list of current laws and regulations that apply to digital currencies:\nContracts under private law: Using Bitcoin does not render parties exempt from the application of the rule of law\nConsumer protection: All of the legal obligations resulting from the sale of a good to a consumer apply to transactions with Bitcoin\nFraud: The investing public is protected by existing criminal legislation against fraudulent Bitcoin schemes.\nFinancial services law: The activities of digital currency businesses that are similar to money services businesses will soon have to play by the same rules as their fiat counterparts.\nMessage to Senators\nOne message that came through very clearly: Regulations will send promising job-creating Bitcoin businesses off to friendlier jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom, as is already happening in Australia and New York.\nCanada can benefit most from encouraging digital currency innovation without tying the hands of innovators who are in new territory that doesn\u2019t necessarily resemble past tech systems, they said.\n\u201cI highly encourage digital currency players to respond to draft regulation when it is published through the official channels,\u201d Amber Scott said. \u201cWhile there have been some cynical comments from industry players about comment periods being \u2018window dressing,\u2019 everyone that I have spoken to at the Department of Finance seems genuinely interested in getting it right and taking industry feedback seriously.\u201d\nCanada Can Be a World Leader\nThere was a strong argument made by witnesses that Canada is well placed with tech expertise, cheaper energy rates and a knowledge infrastructure to be the No. 1 Bitcoin country in the world.\nCanada already has more ATMs and mining nodes per population than any other country. The Bitcoin Embassy\u2019s Babin-Tremblay said that if the Canadian government provides only a \u201clight and neutral\u201d fiscal and regulatory framework, the economy could benefit from Bitcoin business job creation.\n\nRead Susan\u2019s first article in this series from Oct 19, 2014.", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 27}

Clients can choose to increase the amount with a 1 percent flat fee. The security firm also provides transparency, improved management controls and internal checks for better monitoring of the exchange\u2019s security.\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to have CoinHako\u2019s Bitcoin exchange secured on our platform\u201d, said BitGo CEO Mike Belshe. \u201cThe team at CoinHako has been a great development partner, and we fully support their focus on security as one of the core tenets of their business. I\u2019m confident that they will be a great contributor to the Singaporean Bitcoin ecosystem.\u201d\nCoinHako\nThe integration comes just after Pramodh Rai, a former graduate analyst at Barclays Bank joins the young startup as lead developer. In addition, the move is to better secure their platform and holdings as they hope to soon expand throughout Asia.\n\u201cSecurity is of utmost importance, particularly in the wake of recent hacks at Mt. Gox and other exchanges,\u201d said CoinHako CEO and co-founder, Yusho Liu. \u201cWe have instituted various measures of security within CoinHako to protect our funds and users. This latest integration with BitGo means our funds are insured against theft and hackers. Moreover, this integration has also enabled us to shift to multi-signature wallets, which is the best industry practice currently.\u201d\nBitgo Entering Asia\nCoinHako is the most recent Asian partnership for the security firm. Hong Kong-based Bitspark and South Korea-based Coinone, partnered with Bitgo earlier this month, becoming the firm\u2019s first Asian customers.\nBitGo\u2019s insurance and security offering is the only one of its kind, and, according to Belshe, it is in high demand and slowly becoming what is expected out of exchanges.\n\u201cThe first thing users should do is make sure they are using an exchange that\u2019s backed by the best technology \u2013 and using multi-signature wallets like those BitGo offers is one of the key tenets of putting this into practice,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBeyond that, insurance will certainly play a growing role in securing crypto financial assets on exchanges and elsewhere,\u201d Belshe added. \u201cBitGo insurance-backed offering remains unique in the market, but demand is ramping sharply and we expect that such programs will soon become a baseline expectation for savvy investors and traders.\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 28}

This was widely interpreted as an MIT takeover of the roles of leadership, funding and co-ordination of Bitcoin technical development, previously claimed by the Bitcoin Foundation. In parallel, Bitcoin policy think tank Coin Center is claiming the role of interface to policy makers and regulators, with the publication of a framework for state digital currency regulation.\nThe report, titled \u201cState Digital Currency Principles and Framework,\u201d is a model for digital-currency-specific regulations and laws. The report provides a template with structure, definitions and language for the essential components of any digital currency law: \u200bwho must be licensed, how start-ups are encouraged, how solvency is guaranteed and other necessary elements.\nRecently, Bitcoin-friendly bills have been proposed in Utah, New Hampshire and New York City. Texas, Kansas, California, Pennsylvania and North Carolina also have expressed interest in Bitcoin regulations, and New York has proposed the controversial \u201cBitlicense\u201d scheme, which many observers consider far too strict.\nCoin Center hopes that states will use the report as a template for their own bills and regulations.\n\u201cThe state that reaps the benefits of new technologies, new jobs and enhanced financial inclusion will be the state that first discovers a path worth following,\u201d says Executive Director Jerry Brito. \u201cWe hope this report will help in that endeavor.\u201d\nBrito adds that, to be a leader in the future of financial technology, a state must carefully forge a path toward consumer protection and avoid the pitfalls of inartful and unnecessarily costly regulation.\nOf course, striking an optimal balance between necessary crime prevention and consumer protection on the one hand and equally necessary innovation and technology leadership on the other is challenging. The recent initiative of the Isle of Man government to create a balanced regulatory environment that offers \u201cfreedom to flourish\u201d to innovative fintech companies, while keeping crime and fraud out, is an important development in that respect.\nThe Coin Center report emphasizes that only operators with unilateral control of customer funds should be subject to a license requirement, and that anti-money laundering (AML) requirements, if absolutely necessary at all, should match, but not exceed, federal standards.\n\u201cIntermediaries who do not assume a position of trust, nonfinancial uses and individual access are digital currency innovations that should be encouraged,\u201d the report says. \u201cThese intermediaries can benefit both consumers and businesses through improved financial privacy, financial inclusion, and vibrant technology-based economies. These uses should not be burdened by compliance costs that lack concomitant consumer protection benefits.\u201d\nBrito, who is also a professor of Law at George Mason University, co-authored the report \u201cBitcoin: A Primer for Policymakers.\u201d Coin Center is a not-for-profit research and advocacy center focused on public policy issues facing cryptocurrency technologies such as Bitcoin.\n\u201cOur mission is to build a better understanding of these technologies and to promote a regulatory climate that preserves the freedom to innovate using blockchain technologies,\u201d says the Coin Center website. \u201cWe do this by producing and publishing policy research from respected academics and experts, educating policymakers and the media about blockchain technology, and by engaging in advocacy for sound public policy.\u201d\nIt\u2019s probably too early to speculate on which organizations will co-ordinate the technical and policy-related aspects of Bitcoin development, but it seems clear that MIT and Coin Center are establishing strong leadership positions.", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 27}

The bitcoin purchased by Lawnmower will be deposited to a Bitcoin wallet of a user\u2019s choice.\nThe minimum threshold for bitcoin deposit currently stands at $4, meaning that the accumulated spare change of the transactions must be at least $4 before bitcoins can be purchased by Lawnmower. For example, if a user buys a cup of coffee and a bagel at a local coffee shop worth $7.10, then 90 cents will be categorized as spare change and will be used to purchase bitcoin after the accumulated spare change passes the $4 threshold.\nLawnmower CEO Pieter Gorsira explained that the metaphorical definition of Lawnmower as \u201cworking backwards.\"It's like we\u2019re running the lawnmower over the grass and we\u2019re clipping off a little bit of change,\" he said. \"So, as you go along, we slice all these little blades of grass and collect change from these transactions.\u201d\nLawnmower uses Plaid\u2019s API to integrate bank infrastructure and to access banking data for Wells Fargo, Bank of America, US Bank, Citibank and Chase Bank. The integration of Plaid also allows users to check bank accounts, savings accounts, credit cards and debit cards from the aforementioned banks. If the users do not want their balances from these bank accounts to be rounded off to purchase bitcoin, users can simply turn off the investment function on the app.\nLawnmower\u2019s future revenue model\n\u201cWe're live on both platforms now and chose to launch without charging a transaction fee (on each spare change-to-bitcoin purchase, which user's already pay through Coinbase), a monthly \"management\" fee, or anything along those lines,\" Lawnmower told Bitcoin Magazine via email.\nIn the future, Lawnmower could generate money through referrals, additional customizability features for users' spending/investing habits, and other premium features as part of a larger automated money management program, Lawnmower said.\n\"But we're really focused on rapid growth now, and don't want to bog our users down with any additional fees,\u201d the email said.\n\u201cWe have a lot longer plans once we acquire a user base,\u201d added Gorsira.\nLaunch\nThe beta version was launched on iPhone on March 25, and several users were allowed to sign up and test the application.\n\u201cWe need to see what people like or don\u2019t like so we can start adding features,\" Gorsira said at that time. \"The point is to have users use it, break it and tell us if they like it.

Based in Switzerland and headed by ex-Kraken COO Michael Gr\u00f8nager and former Mycelium engineer Jan M\u00f8ller, the company provides an API for sophisticated in-depth real-time blockchain transaction analysis.\nChainalysis customers \u2013 including regulatory entities, law enforcement and financial service providers \u2013 are empowered with unique insight on all transactions recorded in the Bitcoin blockchain and tools to determine the origin of the bitcoin held by any address.\nBitcoin transactions are not anonymous. Every transaction and the full transaction history of any Bitcoin address are permanently recorded in the tamper-proof public blockchain and open to analysis. The illusion of anonymity stems from the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin addresses, which are not explicitly associated to their owners.\nBut blockchain analysis can often de-anonymize bitcoin users. For example, if a pseudonymous Bitcoin address often sends funds to another address that can be associated to a person (for example a Circle user), it is highly probable that the two persons are one and the same, or closely related.\nRecommended privacy practices, from simple measures such as using fresh Bitcoin addresses for new transactions to strong privacy measures such as dark wallets and mixing services, reduce the risk of being de-anonymized. But the fact that all bitcoin transactions are recorded in the blockchain implies that even one mistake can de-anonymize a user, and especially so when sophisticated blockchain analysis tools are available. In particular, the end-point where bitcoin is exchanged for cash, goods or services is vulnerable.\nA few weeks ago, Chainalysis was forced to defend itself after allegations it had disrupted services with a \u201cSybil attack\u201d that created more than 250 \u201cfalse\u201d Bitcoin nodes to harvest information on the whereabouts of transactions, which provoked strong and often angered reactions by the Bitcoin community. Gr\u00f8nager told CoinDesk that Chainalysis permits monitoring compliance with applicable money transfer regulations, and therefore helps Bitcoin companies to obtain bank accounts and do business with mainstream financial institutions.\nIt is evident that Bitcoin is moving toward mainstreaming and regulations, and therefore services such Chainalysis are here to stay, but such services likely will continue to meet opposition from an important part of the Bitcoin community. A leaked Chainalysis roadmap, now trending on Reddit, has been received with anger and hostile comments.\nThe leaked roadmap sheds light on the current and forthcoming features of the Chainalysis API. For example, Chainalysis customers will soon be able to \u201csearch by transaction hash, cluster name, category etc. [which] will allow for faster investigations via known clusters of interest but also for the API to answer specific questions about transactions or entities of interest.\u201d Soon after that, the API will support unconfirmed transactions as well as \u201cShared multi client repositories for known bad actor reporting,\u201d and an \u201cAdvanced Profiling API\u201d is in the works. The roadmap also details Chainalysis pricing plans \u2013 for example, Institutional clients will pay $500 per month for a set of features including unlimited investigations, shared fraud databases and full API access.\nMany participants in the Reddit discussion are expressing support for strong privacy tools, such as Dark Wallet and the Lightning Network, which may offer better protection against Chainalysis snooping.", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 28}

This system is called fractional reserve banking. The obligations a bank has to its depositors do not match the assets the bank holds, since most of those assets are in the form of loans made to generate revenue for the bank.\u201d\nThe requirements for commercial banks in the State of New York are outlined on the New York Department of Financial Services website. In particular, the initial level of capital should be sufficient to support the proposed business plan and the bank\u2019s risk profile. Initial capital should cover operating losses before the bank attains sustained profitable operations, as well as provide a cushion against unexpected losses.", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 28}

According to Fenton, his position is part-time and volunteer (it had historically been a paid position), and his name had been put forward in consultation with the rest of the Board members.\nThe new leadership announcement comes at a time of uncertainty for the beleaguered Foundation which has been struggling with issues of solvency, transparency, and public image.\nIn an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Fenton stated, \u201cThe first order of business will be both getting the most accurate picture of where we are [financially] and communicating with members and stakeholders on the best ideas and priorities moving forward.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019m not sure how long it will take\u2026but certainly I\u2019ll work to get the most full picture as quickly as possible.\u201d\nThe Foundation\u2019s Financial Reality\nDespite recent reports of the Foundation\u2019s precarious financial position, Fenton is optimistic about its future. \u201cI\u2019m very confident the Foundation can remain in the black partly because prior to my joining as Executive Director, outgoing costs were cut quite a bit. We can do many things in a cautious and financially responsible manner that help the organization and its mission.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to adapt to our current financial reality \u2014 this means focusing on those activities with the highest impact and lowest costs,\u201d Fenton says. \u201cSpending has been reduced a good deal. One of my main goals is to have the Foundation operate at the right size for positive impact while being financially prudent.\u201d\nPivoting Back to a Broader Role\nUnlike his predecessor, Fenton anticipates a broader role for the Foundation. Where Murck advocated a \u201cpivot\u201d in the Foundation\u2019s direction toward core development, Fenton aims to focus \u201con those activities with highest impact and lowest costs.\u201d\n\u201cThe space moves fast and I think that the Foundation found that a focus on core development has some challenges \u2014 for example, funding it is expensive and relies on large donors who may have their own ideas or plans which might not mesh with an elected board and member-driven organization.\u201d\nFenton added, \u201cGoing forward, I think the Bitcoin Foundation can be an asset to Bitcoin by working in education, financial inclusion, advocacy and other areas.\u201d\nTransparency and Accessibility: Concrete Suggestions Welcome\nRegarding issues of transparency, Fenton thinks that the most important areas of transparency are in finances. \u201cI also plan to personally be very accessible on the internal and external forums and other means,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to see as much transparency as possible, provided we always respect the privacy of all members when it comes to membership, communications and other areas which individuals may want to keep private.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019d like to have is people make specific, concrete suggestions on what [members would] like to see. Some of those we can and should implement \u2014 some of those suggestions may come at a sacrifice to privacy or have other drawbacks, so I\u2019d communicate with the membership on any areas of a transparency push that I disagreed with.\u201d\nFenton brings an extensive background in finance, as well as in the Bitcoin space, to the position of Executive Director. He is a prominent investor, consultant and advisor who helped to organize the Dubai Bitcoin Conference and Satoshi Roundtable retreat. His resume includes founding Atlantic Financial, a global-focused consulting and wealth management firm, and a stint at Morgan Stanley, specializing in emerging technologies and emerging markets. He is currently Managing Director of Boston Gulf Advisors Group and on the advisory board for Bitcoin Shop, a publicly traded e-commerce marketplace.", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 14}

A number of top Bitcoin startups including BitGo, BitPay, BlockCypher, ChangeTip, and ShapeShift will be there to connect with job seekers.\nBitcoin Businesses step up to the plate\nSome of the biggest names in the digital currencies world have stepped forward to sponsor this event, a sure sign of the growing maturity of the Bitcoin community.\nThere\u2019s lots of buzz around the lead sponsor, secretive startup 21 Inc., which joins companies like BitPay, BitGo, ChangeTip, ShapeShift, FreshPay, CoinBeyond and Bitwage.\nAlthough the exact nature of its business is not public, 21 Inc. was recently reported to have raised $116m in venture funding, the most ever raised in the digital currency space. Backers include Qualcomm, PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel and venture capitalist Andreessen Horowitz.\nThe Plug and Play Tech Centre and Coinality, an online job board for the Bitcoin industry, are producing the fair. Coinality Founder and CEO Dan Roseman is being cautious about the turnout but thinks there\u2019s a much broader range of skill sets in demand now that Bitcoin startups have matured.\n\u201cBitcoin is creating new career opportunities in the tech sector as venture capital continues to accelerate growth among bitcoin startups. A couple of years ago, most bitcoin careers required an advanced technical skill set. However, today we are seeing more demand for a broader range of skill sets (administrative, creative, marketing, legal/regulation, etc.) as bitcoin startups begin to mature beyond a Minimal Viable Product. \u201c\nBitHack Included\nIn addition to the Job Fair, the event will also feature a hackathon sponsored by ChangeTip, BitGo and ShapeShift, and organized by the College Crypto Network. The 72-hour bithack is designed to showcase new talent as companies look to more sophisticated program development.\nParticipants in the BitHack will have their choice of 4 3PIs to build on top of, including ChangeTip, ShapeShift and BitGo.\nVictoria van Eyk, VP Community Development with ChangeTip, will be there and welcomes the opportunity to reach out to the community: \u201cJob fairs and hackathons like this are a great opportunity for people to congregate, get acquainted, and create value together \u2013 both immediate and long term. We are really excited to meet everyone and see what people are up to, find great talent and see what people use our API for.\u201d\nWall Street Journal\u2019s Mike Casey and Paul Vigna will take your questions\nWall Street Journal reporters Mike Casey and Paul Vigna have been keeping Wall Street and us up-to-date on the evolving world of digital currencies and recently published The Age of Cryptocurrency. They will be answering your questions Saturday evening at a Q&A panel held in the Plug and Play Tech Centre.\nAs Coinality\u2019s Dan Roseman noted: \u201cMost of the hype around bitcoin is around merchant adoption, with little attention given to job creation. Coinality believes that the bitcoin job market is one of the most important indicators of the technology\u2019s success. We are encouraged by the steady growth in the bitcoin job market and are pleased to work with Plug And Play to host Bitcoin Job Fairs as a way of connecting bitcoin startups with the talent they need to succeed.\u201d\nPlug and Play is a global startup accelerator that specializes in growing tech startups. Plug and Play\u2019s international network includes 300+ tech startups, 180+ investors and a community of leading universities and corporate partners. The first Sunnyvale job fair in May 2014 featured 34 startups including BitPay, Circle, Xapo, and Kraken and over 400 job seekers. Admission to the job fair is free for job seekers.", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 16}

These units will be delivered in batches of five and placed in several major cities including Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal.\nIn 2014, CAVIRTEX attempted a similar rollout of BitAccess bitcoin ATMs, installing them in Gateway Newstands across Canada. The experiment was far from successful, and the company shut down the endeavor a few months later. They ended up selling off their machines at a substantial loss.\nWhile the locations gave the CAVIRTEX bitcoin ATMs high visibility, their failure has been attributed to the fact that they were inadequately staffed and prone to malfunction, with little to no troubleshooting support.\nQuadriga said this new rollout will be different.\n\u201cWe are excited to finally be bringing some functional and beautiful two-way bitcoin ATM machines to Canada,\u201d said Cotten.\nHe explained that the new BitXATM devices are among the most reliable, intuitive and user-friendly bitcoin ATMs on the market. It features an industry-leading 17-inch touch screen that promises to promote ease-of-use. Furthermore, the rollout will happen in small batches, allowing for time to ensure that each new machine is supported and operating properly from the outset.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done our research,\u201d says Cotten. \u201cWe know the owners of every major bitcoin ATM company. We have used many of them and spoken to previous owners. We have conducted extensive due diligence and feel as though our track record with regard to bitcoin ATM distribution across Canada will allow us to continue to provide a superior service.\u201d\nQuadrigaCX has beenresponsible for installing the first Lamassu and Skyhook units in Canada. Since then, they have placed more than 40 machines across the country.\nThe world\u2019s first bitcoin ATM, the Robocoin at Waves, was launchedby Bitcoiniacs in Vancouver at the end of 2013. Quadriga installed the second bitcoin machine, Canada\u2019s first Lamassu, three months later. The company went on to purchase and install more than a dozen additional Lamassu machines across Canada last year, as well as Canada\u2019s first Skyhook.\nLike most other independently owned bitcoin ATMs across Canada, these machines will trade on the Quadriga CX platform. These new BitXATM machines also will be modified to allow for direct cash deposits and withdrawals from customers\u2019 Quadriga CX balances.\nCotten expects to launch the first of the new machines in the heart of downtown Vancouver in early June.

Its aim is to bridge the gap between bitcoin and fiat currencies through trading services, debt instruments, merchant services and other strategies.\nIn a press statement, Gavin Smith, chief executive and founding director of First Global Credit said, \u201cWe are delighted to welcome Jon to the board; we have found we share a mutual vision for both the future of bitcoin and how First Global Credit will fit into that ecosystem. Jon\u2019s comprehensive knowledge and connections within the Bitcoin community will be extremely beneficial to the growth and development of the business.\u201d\nMatonis, a founding board member and former executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, has an extensive career in finance and Bitcoin. His resume includes prior positions as CEO of HushMail and Director of Financial Services at VeriSign. A high-profile figure and thought leader in the digital currency community, he also serves on the boards or advisory boards of several other companies in the space, including BitGame Labs, BitPay, GoCoin and CoinDesk.\n\u201cThere are a lot of companies that maintain bitcoin on their books,\u201d Matonis said in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThose bitcoins usually sit there dormant or even depreciating in value. What First Global does is offer to collateralize those bitcoins so that they can actually get a return.\u201d\nMatonis gave the example of online gaming. Traditional casino operators are able to get a return on their floats. But up until now, bitcoin casinos have not been able to do this. First Global offers them an opportunity to generate a yield, said Matonis.\n\u201cI\u2019m also excited by the ability to use bitcoin assets as collateral for trading in the futures and options markets,\u201d Matonis added. \u201cCurrently, T-bills can be used as collateral on various exchanges, but no one has structured it with bitcoin. First Global Credit plans to add futures markets as one of the markets available via their program.\u201d\n\u201cJon has the big picture,\u201d said Marcie Terman, communications director for First Global. \u201cHe has the Bitcoin background and the financial background. He can look at our systems and make sure they are as robust as possible.

Therefore, the RBA will adopt a wait-and-see approach. If and when bitcoin or other digital currencies start to grow significantly and raise public interest concerns, the RBA will reconsider appropriate regulations.\nBut for the time being the RBA will trust market-driven solutions rather than engaging in costly regulations. Richards said that consumers should be careful not to misunderstand the degree of protection offered by regulation or oversight, which may lead them to exercise less caution than warranted when selecting and using service providers.\nJonathon Miller, co-founder of Bitcoin trading platform Bit Trade Australia, replied to the Senate inquiry, stating that the double taxation hitting Bitcoin trades in Australia \u2013 where a 10 percent Goods and Service Tax (GST) is applied to Bitcoin transactions \u2013 forces Australian bitcoin users to go offshore.\n\u201cThat is 10 percent more than buying bitcoins in other jurisdiction,\u201d he said. \u201cThe net effect has been a shutdown of some businesses and a reduction of volume and trade in this jurisdiction.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association (ADCCA) has announced a new constitution. In an interesting twist, the new ADCCA constitution has been recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\u201cADCCA used the Blockchain technology behind Bitcoin to certify the authenticity of its constitution,\u201d ADCCA chairman Ron Tucker said. \u201cEveryone can now easily determine which copies of our constitution are authentic.\u201d\nTucker hopes that the constitution will allow ADCCA to develop more formal relationships with those who have a stake in the digital currency, and represent the wider fintech industry in the future.\n\u201cToday saw organizations such as Westpac and the Australian Banking Association give favorable nods to the work of ADCCA, including our work on ensuring all digital currency businesses comply with best practice standards on consumer protection,\u201d he said.\n\nAustralian Treasury / CC BY-SA 3.0", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 14}

Similar standards-based professional organizations have been critical to the functioning of our traditional economy, and there is little doubt that the DCC will play an equally important role in the emerging digital currency economy.\nHistorical Parallels\nThe DCC Certification is similar to other certifications that assure clients that the professional has the expected level of competence. Such certifications enable the professional to differentiate him or herself from the crowd. Certifications allow us to hold professionals who are advising clients to a higher standard, and provide a benchmark for evaluating skill and professional value.\nFor example, the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) certification began over 50 years ago in response to increased interest by the public in investing, and a growing recognition that advisers should have the expertise that met the need for sound financial advice. Original members were grandfathered in through work experience alone, but now the exam is one of the more difficult in the industry and the certification one of the more prestigious. With an annual pass rate of only 50 percent or fewer, the CFA certification guarantees that the holder has the requisite depth of knowledge to offer sound guidance to clients seeking risk adjusted investment returns.\nThe DCC is on track for a similar outcome, where holders of the DCC certification can present to clients that they are held to a higher standard of knowledge and ethics. There is a significant and growing opportunity for professionals in the digital currency economy. I am glad to see the development of the DCC and to be a part of its membership community, as it will support professionals in developing their respective businesses and add a credible, even foundational, structure to the ongoing growth of digital currencies.\nThe Impact\nIn my opinion, the development of digital currencies will have as much an impact, if not a greater impact, on society as did the Internet. Digital currencies revolutionize the manner through which goods and services can be purchased, and by which business can be transacted across the globe. The Internet offered instant open-source global communication and information exchange, and now digital currency offers the same open access for financial exchange. The future of the digital currency economy will be molded by the accountants, lawyers and financial professionals who step up today.\nGovernments at all levels are attempting to keep pace with the growth of digital currency, and are reacting with a variety of definitions, laws and regulations in an attempt to fit digital currency into existing frameworks. This dynamic presents significant challenges to any professional seeking to guide clients through the perilous, unclear and evolving landscape.\nWith this backdrop, the DCC is offering professionals a means to obtain the knowledge and skills required of professionals in the digital currency economy, along with a respected credential that will identify their unique expertise.\nThe Demand\nWhen I began educating myself on digital currencies, there were no obvious resources for trusted, unbiased and accurate information. It took me six months to learn all that was available through multiple resources, many of which were conflicting or unclear. I needed an unbiased and accurate place to discover the facts behind digital currency and test my hypotheses amongst trusted peers. I only wish the DCC was available when I was finding my footing in the ecosystem. The DCC provides the professional adviser an efficient means for getting quickly up to speed on digital currencies, so he or she can take a leadership role in the new economy.\nAs millions of individuals, businesses and investors are already actively engaged with digital currencies; and as governments begin to share guidance and promulgate regulations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there is no shortage of demand for competent professional advice. Yet there are an inadequate number of professionals who have invested the significant time necessary to get educated on this new area of practice. And consumers of these professional services are left wanting for clarity with regards to the skills and experience of their prospective advisers.\nThe DCC will help professionals efficiently separate fact from fiction; equipping them to advise individual consumers, merchants and investors. Further, it will provide a mark that will enable consumers of professional services to identify and engage advisers with the requisite expertise and commitment to ethical conduct.", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 15}

Bitspark CEO George Harrap, told Bitcoin Magazine the integration has been months in the making.\n\u201cWe approached BitGo some time before Bitstamp was hacked,\u201d he said. The partnership with the Bitcoin security provider could not come at a more important time for the Asian bitcoin industry.\nIn February, China-based crypto-currency exchange, Bter, was hacked, and 7,170 bitcoin (worth $1.75 million at the time) were stolen, causing the exchange to almost shut down. The exchange is now beginning to pay back customers with a loan from a Chinese security firm, but the future of the Bter remains unclear. In addition, Hong Kong-based Bitcoin exchange Mycoin disappeared in February with an estimated $8.1 million in customers funds.\nThe partnership with BitGo makes Bitspark the first Asian exchange to secure their bitcoin reserves with multi-signature technology.\nSecuring the World\u2019s Bitcoin\n\u201cMulti-sig security is such a critical factor for any Bitcoin-related company, and BitGo has been very supportive throughout the process,\u201d said Harrap.\nSince the launch of its multi-signature product in late 2013, BitGo has been partnering with large and small Bitcoin startups. The Bitcoin security provider has since partnered with BitStamp, the Bitcoin Foundation, CriptoBanco, Binary Financial and others.\nThe firm has even introduced the first-ever theft insurance for a Bitcoin company, from a globally A-rated insurance provider.\n\nAt the core of BitGo\u2019s offering is multi-signature, a bitcoin transaction that requires more than one private key. These private keys can be distributed among many people, across many geographical locations, making the company\u2019s funds safer. One key is held with BitGo, and two others with the client.\n\nIn addition to multi-sig, BitGo also offers 24/7 security monitoring, anti-phishing protection, privacy protection and user authentication.\n\nNot your typical bitcoin investors\n\u201cThe closure of this funding round ensures that we have the support needed to continue to expand our service offerings,\u201d said Harrap.\n\nAccording to Bitspark\u2019s press release, the company raised a \u201c6-figure sum\u201d from private investors as part of the company\u2019s seed round. According to Harrap, the investors \u201caren\u2019t your usual Bitcoin investors and this is probably their first investment in a Bitcoin company.\u201d Instead of Bitcoin, he says, they come from the larger Asian financial technology industry.\n\nThe company was originally funded with money from Bitspark\u2019s founders and a $530,000 Hong Kong dollar ($68,387 USD) investment from the startup incubator, Cyberport. In addition to the money, the incubator also offers two years of office space, help with hiring and business development and access to business resources.\n\n\nNew countries and products\n\nBitspark plans to use the newly raised funds to expand to new markets. The exchange is looking to expand to mainland China, Singapore, Thailand and other Southeast Asian markets. The exchange already operates in Australia, Indonesia, Hong Kong and the Philippines.\n\nA portion of the funds will be used to grow the company\u2019s service and product offering.\n\nIn line with the company\u2019s philosophy of \u201cbitcoin in the background,\u201d the exchange will launch their recently beta-tested pre-paid bitcoin cards. These cards will allow people to buy bitcoin at convenience stores and send it to their love ones in other countries \u2013 all without having to touch the digital currency.\n\nThe cards will soon leave beta in the Philippines and be expanded to stores all around the country. The Bitcoin company also hopes to bring the product to Indonesia later this year.\n\nThe Bitcoin exchange will use the funds to launch an advance trading product, which Harrap says they have being getting a lot of requests for. The new trading solution will be a similar experience to other financial products and include charts and technical indicators.\n\nImage via Bitspark.", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 14}

The service was one of the first Bitcoin companies to decentralize their bitcoin buying service and integrate multi-signature bitcoin transactions.\nThe announcement follows on the heels of Brawker\u2019s former CEO, Cyril Houri\u2019s, departure from the company earlier this month. The Bitcoin marketplace has been in control of the developers behind the company since.\n\u201c[O]ur growth rate did not meet our expectations, and the service does not scale as we would have expected to,\u201d read the company\u2019s farewell blog post.\nBrawker is the most recent development in a string of prominent Bitcoin companies shutting down. Just last week, Buttercoin, a B2B bitcoin exchange operating in the United States closed its doors, citing a lack of venture capitalist interest. The exchange raised $1.3 million from investment firms just four months prior to its closure.\nIn late February, the Canadian Bitcoin exchange, Cavirtex, shut down due to troubled banking relations and security concerns. The exchange was hacked just weeks prior to the announcement, which caused users\u2019 passwords and two-factor authentication secrets to be compromised. Cavirtex previously raised money through a virtual IPO on the Havelock investment platform.\nEarlier this month, Cavirtex was bought by New York-based Bitcoin exchange Coinsetter for an undisclosed amount. The Canadian exchange resumed trading early last week.\nA Changing Environment\nBrawker was founded in late 2013, a time the company holds was very different for buying and selling bitcoin. Back then, merchant adoption was low and buying bitcoin with a credit card was difficult. Brawker was a way to solve both of those problems.\nThe platform proved to be a quick and reliable way to buy bitcoin with a credit card, as well as a way for people looking to buy products with bitcoin to get large discounts, anywhere from 5 percent to 20 percent. Early on, the platform found lots of success and popularity.\nAccording to the company, the business has not been able to continue that growth. With a large number of Bitcoin startups founded every month, the ability to buy bitcoin with credit cards or find websites that accept the digital currency has grown incredibly \u2013 ridding Brawker of their main value proposition.\n\u201cThe Bitcoin community came up with many great startups and the environment is very different from what it was 18 months ago, when we started working on this project,\u201d read a public statement by Brawker.\nThe development team behind Brawker has stopped any new orders, but the platform will remain live until April 30th, allowing users to withdraw any funds they might have there.\nThe future of the company remains unclear.

Forde will work with researchers across the institute and leading experts at other universities around the world to address some of the most critical challenges to creating a safe, stable and secure digital currency.\n\u201cAs a technologist, there\u2019s no more exciting place to work than the MIT Media Lab,\u201d said Forde. \u201cThe innovations that come out of the Media Lab have made a truly global impact. I look forward to working with the faculty and students and collaborating with developers, academics, entrepreneurs, governments, and nonprofits to help us get closer to a more robust and viable digital currency that could have tremendous benefits around the world.\u201d\nAt the White House, Forde was responsible for determining how the Obama administration would leverage open data and emerging technologies to address the president\u2019s national priorities.\n\u201cWhile at the White House, Brian led extraordinary initiatives to leverage the power of tech and innovation to make the future of America ever brighter,\u201d said Todd Park, White House adviser for technology.\n\u201cWe are fortunate to have Brian join the Media Lab to help organize an important research agenda to get cryptocurrencies right,\u201d said Ito. \u201cBrian\u2019s experience mainstreaming emerging technologies from the rural mountains of Nicaragua to the White House will be invaluable as he tackles the challenges of digital currency \u2013 one of the most promising emerging technologies for the next 10 years.\u201d\nIn a Medium article, Forde gives more information about the MIT Digital Currency Initiative. He is persuaded that we are at a pivotal point for the digital economy.\n\u201cGetting digital currencies right and realizing the projected impact, present daunting challenges that will require significant research and development to overcome,\u201d he says.\nSeveral renowned MIT experts of economy, cryptography and system security, mentioned in the Medium article, will actively participate in the Digital Currency Initiative together with interested companies, developers, and forward-thinking policy makers. The MIT student community, including Jeremy Rubin, the undergraduate who launched the MIT Bitcoin Project, also will be involved.\nAccording to Forde, the goals of the MIT Digital Currency Initiative are to:\nConduct research and engage more students on digital currency topics that address questions about security, stability, scalability, privacy and economics.Convene governments, nonprofits and the private sector to research and test concepts that have high social impact.Provide evidence-based research to support existing and future policy and standards.\nThere is an overlap between these terms and those of the Bitcoin Foundation. It seems likely that, in view of the troubled history of the foundation, the Bitcoin community could welcome MIT as an alternative, prestigious venue for leadership and coordination of the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nForde hopes that the MIT initiative will provide the support needed for the digital currency community to help realizing the \u201ctremendous opportunities to increase access to critical financial services for all, create more transparent democracies, and develop services that dramatically reduce barriers for global commerce,\u201d and looks forward to connecting with anyone who has feedback or new research.\n\n\u201cMIT Media Lab (E14)\u201d by Sayamindu Dasgupta\u2013 Modified / CC BY-SA 2.0", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 16}

The Liberland territory is not claimed by either of these two states, which according to the group permits it to declare a new \u201cmicrostate\u201d in compliance with international law.\nAfter the Yugoslav Wars, some borderland territories have been disputed, but this area has remained unclaimed. Liberland was created entirely in accordance with international law because it is based on the no man\u2019s land which was claimed neither by Serbia or Croatia in the process of demarcation, InSerbia News reports.\nOn April 13, 2015 a Preparatory Committee declared the new state on the spot and raised a flag to claim the land. V\u00edt Jedli\u010dka, who was elected by the committee as president of the republic, is preparing a constitution as well as diplomatic notes, to be sent to the two neighboring states and to the United Nations, and later to other countries, to inform them about the establishment of the new state of Liberland.\nCreating a new micronation and getting it formally recognized is a daunting task, but Jedli\u010dka is persuaded that the initiative will succeed.\n\u201cThe only thing that could stop us is an army,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine. He added that the process to claim sovereign nation status recognized by the international community has started.\nJedli\u010dka is associated with the Czech Party of Free Citizens, a libertarian political party in the Czech Republic. The party is against too much government intervention in the economy and in the personal lives of citizens. Its members are free-market advocates and oppose the centralization of political power. In accordance with libertarian politics, the motto of Liberland is \u201cTo Live and Let Live.\u201d\nWhile BBC News questions whether Liberland is actually just a publicity stunt, the microstate is accepting applications for citizenship from people everywhere \u2013 provided they don\u2019t have a \u201ccommunist, Nazi or other extremist past.\u201d\n\u201cThe objective of the founders of the new state is to build a country where honest people can prosper without being oppressed by governments making their lives unpleasant through the burden of unnecessary restrictions and taxes,\u201d states the Liberland website. \u201cOne of the reasons for founding Liberland is the ever expanding influence of interest groups on the functioning of existing states and the consequent worsening of living conditions of people. The founders are inspired by countries such as Monaco, Liechtenstein or Hong Kong.\u201d\nThis sounds very appealing to libertarians everywhere, but the challenge is big. It seems likely that the powers that be could easily crush the new microstate as soon as they notice it. Perhaps the only thing that could protect tiny Liberland in its delicate launch phase is a massive display of popular interest. And, in fact, it appears that Liberland is going viral on the Internet, with tens of thousands of signups on its Forum and Facebook page and a lot of applications for citizenship from all over the world in only a couple of days. It appears that many people are ready to try alternatives to traditional politics.\nThe idea that Liberland could adopt a cryptocurrency, and make it official, is trending on the Liberland Forum and Reddit. Jedli\u010dka briefly discussed the idea with the Czech press, and a participant in the Reddit discussion provided a translation. Jedli\u010dka answered the question \u201cSo do you want to create your own currency?\u201d by stating that Liberland is planning to create its own cryptocurrency (a digital currency like Bitcoin), but on the territory of Liberland it will be possible to use any currency.\nJedli\u010dka confirmed to Bitcoin Magazine that Liberland will not have an official currency, but accept all currencies, including bitcoin and other digital currencies. There are plans to establish a Liberland banking system and, according to Jedli\u010dka, some banks have already expressed interest.\nPerhaps the tiny libertarian dreamland in the Balkans doesn\u2019t have much of a chance in the harsh reality of real politics, but the adoption of bitcoin as one of the currencies accepted by a sovereign state could have a huge impact.\n\nImage via liberland.org.", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 16}

But Mazi\u00e8res\u2019 approach deserves a place among the serious alternatives to Bitcoin that have been proposed, alongside Ethereum and Ripple.\nPublic digital currency ledgers rely on distributed consensus protocols to propagate valid transactions. In the Bitcoin network, independent nodes (miners) work together without preferential trust relations. In other words, each node implicitly trusts every other node.\nIn the new protocol, called Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), each node explicitly selects a set of publicly trusted peers, and forwards only the transactions that have been validated by a certain majority of its trusted partners.\nIf correctly implemented with a critical mass of nodes with overlapping trust circles, valid transactions propagate in ripples through the network and eventually achieve systemwide consensus.\n\u201cBitcoin is good, but we wanted to start from scratch,\u201d says Mazi\u00e8res. He is persuaded that the SCP can overcome important limitations of Bitcoin, such as the long confirmation delays and the fact that mining is now a very energy-intensive process. The new system would be able to reliably verify transactions much more quickly and with less energy, and provide enhanced scalability.\nMazi\u00e8res\u2019 protocol has been adopted by Stellar (hence the name SCP), an open-source protocol for value exchange, launched in 2014 by Ripple Labs founder Jed McCaleb (who also founded the infamous Mt.Gox exchange), and backed, among others, by payment processor Stripe. Besides bitcoin payments, Stellar supports fiat currency payments, for example in euros or U.S. dollars, via Stellar exchanges and gateways.\nInitially, Stellar used the Ripple protocol, which also requires nodes to identify a set of trusted nodes to achieve a rippling effect across overlapping trust circles. But a fork in the network prompted Stellar to take steps to build a new consensus protocol, which resulted in the SCP. Ripple maintains that its consensus network is not vulnerable to the issue encountered by Stellar.\nMazi\u00e8res is taking leave from Stanford to work four days a week on the project as Stellar\u2019s chief scientist.\nThe SCP whitepaper, titled \u201cThe Stellar Consensus Protocol: A Federated Model for Internet-Level Consensus,\u201d is available online on the Stellar website. The whitepaper is a technical paper not easy to understand for casual readers, and therefore Stellar has provided a readable summary.\nThe SCP implements \u201cFederated Byzantine Agreement,\u201d a new approach to achieving consensus in a real-world network that includes faulty \u201cByzantine\u201d nodes with technical errors or malicious intent. To tolerate Byzantine failures, SCP is designed not to require unanimous consent from the complete set of nodes for the system to reach agreement, and to tolerate nodes that lie or send incorrect messages.\nIn the SCP, individual nodes decide which other participants they trust for information, and partially validate transactions based on individual \u201cquorum slices.\u201d The systemwide quorums for valid transactions result from the individual quorum decisions by individual nodes.\nAccording to Stellar, the SCP is the first provably safe consensus mechanism that simultaneously enjoys four key properties: decentralized control, low latency, flexible trust and asymptotic security. The SCP achieves optimal resilience against ill-behaved participants, allowing an organic growth model similar to that of the Internet for the Stellar network.\n\nImage via stellar.org.", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 17}

With this newfound freedom, we want to exercise our rights to make Paycoin the people\u2019s money and do what is necessary to help the coin thrive,\u201d the Paycoin Foundation wrote on its site.\nIn an open dialogue, many of the parties to be a part of Paycoin going forward\u2014save for Josh Garza\u2014talked about what their goals are for Paycoin and what\u2019s going to happen to the current environment.\n\u201cBy the sounds of it, all three nonprofit organizations are working together to look at the original documents, both published and unpublished, regarding the structure of the coin to see if a rebranding is necessary,\u201d said Jonah, a manager, in a video posted online.\n\u201cFrom my seat, and the reason why we\u2019re here, is to truly make it a community-driven project. That\u2019s why I got involved in the beginning. I was like, hey, one entity was going to launch this thing, how was it ever going to become a decentralized currency. That\u2019s really what this whole thing is; it\u2019s about decentralization, not centralization,\u201d said Adam Matlack, president and chairman of Paycoin Foundation, in the same video.\nBut Where is GAW?\n\u201cWe have advised that this call not happen to give us an opportunity to speak with each party in private so we can figure out a compromise and solution,\u201d said Josh Garza, CEO of GAW, posting under the name MrCEO.\nWhile the details of the agreement are unknown, posts on the Hashtalk forum indicate that GAW agreed to give Paycoin to this consortium as long as certain rules were kept in place.\n\u201cThe Paycoin foundation was gifted the controllers with the agreement that the whitepaper would be delivered on. They have breached that agreement with this, and will force the investment group that came in at the beginning to bring legal action against them,\u201d said Garza in another thread.\nHowever, this consortium doesn\u2019t appear to have much concern pertaining to the potential lawsuit. Multiple times, parties in the conversation agreed that they were looking to go forward, not in reverse.\n\u201cI would say that we are aware of some of the things that have been said, but honestly, but from our position, there is legal documentation in place that clarifies this issue,\u201d said Adam Matlack in a video interview.\nThis jockeying back and forth clearly has many in the community concerned. Members continue to post, talking about how people\u2019s money is at stake and how the two parties need to figure out what to do going forward.\nThis schism in the community is especially worrisome for Paycoin investors, as each faction holds exactly 50 percent of the Prime Controllers, which govern Paycoin\u2019s codebase. This means that Paycoin could have two incompatible blockchains: one controlled entirely by GAW that is currently compatible with exchanges and one that is supported by the consortium and referred to as \u201cPaycoin 2.0.\u201d\nPaycoin 2.0 does not have exchange support at this time, so users currently have no options to buy or sell the coin.\nWhere to Go From Here\nNow that the consortium has control, there are many steps the parties are looking to take in an attempt to continue keeping Paycoin going.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s being looked at is how to actually implement all the technology that does and does not exist involved with the coin and developing the coin to that original spec to make Paycoin what it was designed to be,\u201d said Jonah.\nAnd more importantly, according to Matlack, the whitepaper doesn\u2019t accurately reflect the technicalities of Paycoin.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the whitepaper was a marketing document. And we need to get to a place that it is actually a cryptographic document and we actually implement those things. We can\u2019t implement words into a code base. We need actual code,\u201d said Matlack (emphasis added).\n\u201cHowever, a lot of what was initially built by the primary coin development team were specs that were not completed,\u201d said Jonah.\nBut on top of that, according to GAW employee Matthew Eden, team members knew there was no way that GAW could guarantee a base $20/XPY that was promised to investors. Eden, the ex-Interim CTO, Interim Chief Information Security Officer, Interim IT Manager, and Director of QA at GAW gave an interview to Bits of News.\n\u201cThe initial plan for XPY was that it would never be traded on an exchange. Many people made it known that if the coin hit an exchange they would never hold a $20 price floor. Making the only people who had it the users who had been mining hash-points with their hashlets. The excess was going to be sold off on the websites (Paybase/Zencloud.) Once it hit the exchange, all plans were changed. Dumping it became the primary method of obtaining funds for the company,\u201d Eden explained in the interview (emphasis added).\nZenCloud and PayBase Are Being Decommissioned\nIt gets worse, though. People who signed up for ZenCloud as what\u2019s called \u201cimmortals\u201d were promised consistent payouts. And as new members joined, those payouts became possible. However, now ZenCloud is being shut down.\n\u201cZenCloud has been transitioned out to a third-party company that will be managing it and PayBase through end of life,\u201d said Eden in the video. \u201cPayBase will be operational until at the end of the month, and ZenCloud will be operational until the last immortal hash staker has effectively expired,\u201d said Matthew Eden, one of the developers of the Paycoin Core Development Organization.\nDespite the fact these members were called immortals and believed themselves to have the potential to generate payouts, that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case. On top of that, the developers appear to have always understood that it couldn\u2019t run forever despite promises to the contrary.\n\u201cZenCloud cannot be run forever,\u201d said Eden. \u201cIt cannot continue to sit there and manage payouts. If you haven\u2019t activated your hashstaker, activate it. There will be a point in time when we will probably actively turn them on for you if you don\u2019t activate it because we can\u2019t leave the system on forever.\u201d\nUsers paid for lifetime Bitcoin miners and are instead being given Paycoin miners that are essentially worthless.\nIs GAW Doomed?\n\u201cVery few employees still work at GAW Miners. One support rep is left, and there is Josh. His in-laws still work there, I believe,\u201d said Eden in the interview. He explained that his reason for leaving was \u201cthe realization that GAW Miners LLC had not honored the requirements of the Acquisition Agreement and merger documents that were part of the LeaseRig.net / GAW merger and also ethical reasons.\u201d\nThe interview ended with Eden giving his most poignant description of Garza when talking about the transition of Paycoin.\n\u201cYou mean the lack of foresight?\u201d Eden asked. \u201cI\u2019d say it was pretty much in line with his past actions. He doesn\u2019t really think things through all the way before acting.\u201d\nBetween the lawsuit from the power company, the potential investigation by the SEC, the implosion of Paycoin, and employees leaving the company, GAW\u2019s future is uncertain.\n\u201cI\u2019d say he [Garza] had moved on,\u201d Eden said in the interview. \u201cAnd then came back to move more of the intellectual property over to off-shore corporations.\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 18}

The exchange hopes to be a safe and reliable way for Chileans to access and invest in bitcoin.\nChile is right next door to Argentina, a country well known in the Bitcoin industry. Argentina\u2019s high inflation and strict capital controls have created conditions many believe will ignite Bitcoin adoption in the country. But unbeknownst to most, Chileans have had a growing interest in digital currency as well.\nThe country has been home to a small-but-growing Bitcoin community. There are more than 200 registered members in the Santiago, Chile Bitcoin Meetup, as well as numerous businesses that accept the digital currency. But Chileans have few ways to buy and sell bitcoin.\nBy being the country\u2019s first Bitcoin exchange, SurBTC hopes to provide a safer and easier way for people to acquire the digital currency.\nGuillermo Torrealba, CEO and co-founder of SurBTC, told Latin America tech news outletFayerWayer, \u201c[\u2026] for this technology to fulfill its promise to transform the way that much of global finance operates, you must first fill it with responsible companies that offer products and services that not only seek returns, but which will help to develop this emerging industry.\n\u201cWe are interpreting this \u2018responsibility,\u2019 offering a very transparent, secure exchange and open to other entrepreneurs to connect and develop their own solutions,\u201d Torrealba said. \u201cThis is the only way that people can forget the scams that have been.\u201d\nThe process to launch the exchange started nearly a year ago. SurBTC wanted to make sure the exchange was fully complaint and had strong banking relations. After being rejected from 6 major banks in Chile, they finally found a banking partner willing to work with a Bitcoin company.\nAccording to Torrealba, banking relations is the primary reason the exchange has taken so long to launch.\n\u201cThese are the necessary steps that new Bitcoin companies have to go through in order to erase the bad reputation some left behind,\u201d he said.\nAlong the way, the startup did find support from an unlikely source, the Chilean government. The Bitcoin startup received $40,000 from the Chilean government equity-free, as part of one the state\u2019s startup initiatives.\nAccording to a press release, the SurBTC team felt it was \u201cextraordinary validation,\u201d as it was the first time the Chilean government had given money to a Bitcoin startup.\nSurBTC was co-founded by Chilean businessmen Torrealba and Augustine Feuerhake. A former business professor, Torrealba previously worked for a Latin American business consultancy firm before co-founding Baltoro, a seawater desalination startup.\nFeuerhake is a four-time startup founder with more than eight years of experience in mobile development.\nThe company launched its exchange late last month, but according to Torrealba, SurBTC is already seeing a lot of traction. SurBTC is also looking to accommodate more traders by adding more services and adding U.S. dollars to the platform soon.\nSurBTC has ambitions of expanding throughout Latin America and being the primary exchange for the whole region. Torrealba said the company will be expanding to other countries very quickly in 2015.", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 20}

The price will start at 25,000 NeuCoin for 1 Bitcoin (approx. $0.01 per NeuCoin) and increase by 1 percent each day. The pre-sale will end after 60 days or after all coins have been sold.\nThe Paris-based NeuCoin startup has already raised $2.25 million from a group of investors.\nCo-founder Dan Kaufman is confident about the launch of NeuCoin and told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been getting thousands of emails and feel there\u2019s a lot of interest and anticipation for the pre-sale. People seem to appreciate our solid angel investors and consumer-friendly micropayments approach. Since there are no daily caps, the 100 million NeuCoins may sell out very fast.\u201d\nIn addition, the company will be distributing its \u201cfreemium\u201d model free to consumers who just want to try it out, and there will be more for customers who recruit other new customers. Businesses that promote NeuCoin and accept micropayments in NeuCoin will also receive \u201cfreemium\u201d coin.\nWhat is NeuCoin?\nNeuCoin is a digital currency that is easy to use and ideal for online tipping and micropayments. Co-founder Dan Kaufman says he made the consumer his first priority and his goal was always to develop the most user-friendly of all the digital currencies.\nNeuCoin uses a similar model to Peercoin and is often referred to as a peer-to-peer coin. It is based on proof-of-stake (PoS), rather than proof-of-work (PoW) and pays interest to owners as the coin is staked (as opposed to miners).\nNeucoin says that its high PoS rates reward early NeuCoin adopters and address a key security issue by rewarding PoS miners to stake numerous NeuCoins and operate many nodes.\nWhy NeuCoin instead of Bitcoin?\nAccording to Dan Kauffman, the real motivator for developing NeuCoin was the inaccessibility and techie nature of Bitcoin \u2013 a great idea but too hard for consumers to access and use.\nKaufman, with his partners Johan Sandstrom, Oph\u00e9lie Pubellier and Scott Walker, recently released a whitepaper arguing that Proof of Stake (PoS) is superior to Bitcoin\u2019s Proof of Work with its high costs, mining centralization and the ever-increasing costs of Bitcoin mining hardware.\nKaufman maintains that Bitcoin suffers from too much centralization, particularly in the area of mining, with fewer companies owning more and more mining equipment.\nAnd he says it is more than likely that Bitcoin transaction fees will go up in the future.\nEarly Investors\nMajor angel investors include Emil Michael, SVP of business at Uber, Henrik Kjellberg, president of Hotwire, Patrik Stymne, co-founder of King (Candy Crush Saga), Rob Goldman, head of growth at Facebook, Ted Rogers from Xapo, and dozens of other top tech and media executives.\nStrategic advisers to the startup include Spotify\u2019s Alex Norstrom, Dogecoin creator Jackson Palmer and Brock Pierce, entrepreneur and Bitcoin Foundation board member.\nThree Nonprofit Foundations designed to decentralize NeuCoin\nThree nonprofit groups located on the Isle of Man will develop and support NeuCoin, each with their own focus \u2013 core development, growth and utility.\nEach foundation has different council members, budgets and priorities and is ultimately controlled by all the people who own NeuCoin (one coin equals one vote).\nAbout 2.4 billion of the total NeuCoin supply has been placed in the hands of these three independent foundations, and they are responsible for distributing these coins to developers and entrepreneurs.\nThe NeuCoin team is planning a public launch for July and has said they will guarantee that if the NeuCoin platform isn\u2019t up and running by September they\u2019ll return the pre-sale funds, which will be held in escrow until the coin is issued.\n\u201cWith the funding from our angel investors\u2026we already have all the money needed to finish the code, the super easy online wallet, the consumer on-boarding site and more,\u201d Kaufman said. \u201cThe proceeds from the pre-sale will go to NeuCoin\u2019s nonprofit foundations and fund later consumer marketing and development of micropayment platforms with MondoMedia, a video content producer with the largest animation channel on YouTube, to develop and Jango.com, a streaming music service with 8 million monthly listeners.\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 20}

BitSIM converts the SIM card into a fully encrypted bitcoin wallet compatible with a wide range of cell phones, including cheap and unsophisticated feature phones.\n\u201cBitSIM puts bitcoins on any SIM, on any mobile phone, for mass adoption and frictionless ecosystem uptake,\u201d claims the BitSIM website. Users will be able to pay locally with NFC-enabled phones, but also send and receive bitcoin with a simple SMS to other users anywhere in the world.\nThe BitSIM website notes that this simple application can disrupt the $1 trillion remittance market, which is poorly served by companies such as Western Union.\nBitSIM seems tailor-made for sending remittances to developing regions of the world where the adoption of cell phones is booming, but most users have only cheap-feature phones. And remittances are just the first application: The BitSIM technology could add a simple bitcoin payment layer to the Internet of Things (IoT), the upcoming pervasive network of smart, connected devices.\nBitSIM, based in Hong Kong, is funded by Seedcoin, a seed-stage Bitcoin and blockchain startup virtual incubator.\nIn a video interview titled \u201cBitSIM: Bitcoin Between SIM and Phone,\u201d the startup\u2019s founder, Leon Gerard Vandenberg, shows how, by slipping a zero-footprint SIM between the carrier\u2019s SIM card and the phone, BitSIM \u201cup-techs even ancient feature-phones with a new technology stack.\u201d Providing NFC and fully-encrypted Bitcoin transactions over SMS, even a smart-contract-capable JVM runtime, BitSIM is \u201ca stealthy technology injection that routes around the carrier monopolies without their permission.\u201d\nAn interesting feature of the BitSIM add-on sticker is that it doesn\u2019t require the authorization of the phone manufacturer, or of the carrier that provides the SIM.\n\u201cThe hardware is called a ZSIM,\u201d explains Vandenberg. \u201cIt\u2019s a zero-footprint SIM that sits between the original SIM and the carrier\u2019s cell phone and interposes SIM commands between the original SIM and the phone. So the phone thinks there is a SIM there, and the original SIM thinks there is a phone there.\u201d (See this trending discussion on Reddit for explanations of how the BitSIM technology works.)\nBitSIM\u2019s ZSIM is a \u201cthin SIM\u201d (also known as \u201coverlay SIM\u201d), a chip embedded into a thin plastic sheet that sits on top of an ordinary SIM card, making available to the user services that were not foreseen by the carrier or the phone maker. Thin SIMs have been denounced as a security risk by phone carriers, but that is likely due to their potential to disrupt the carriers\u2019 business models more than to an actual risk for consumers.\nIn a September 2014 interview with Brave New Coin, Vandenberg noted that, with the globally adopted use of SMS technology, BitSIM can literally bank the unbanked overnight by giving power back to users, effectively allowing anybody with a cell phone to be their own bank. \u201cAnything running on top of the Bitcoin protocol is also within the reach of bitSIM users,\u201d he said, and noted that bitSIM is a platform supported by a developer community.", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 20}

The funds will be used to get the OSS Mentality website running, develop an online store and pay creative freelancers. The organization has already scored sponsorship ahead of the campaign from companies such as Hayabusa MMA Gear, Headrush apparel, Rockwell watches, and Vane Protective Gear.\n\u201cWe added bitcoin to the campaign to help start the conversation,\u201d said Byrne. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that having that knowledge and that conversation, it will lead it somewhere else \u2013 to a whole community of people who aren\u2019t familiar with it.

It was organized by Cureativ and took place in Rhubard Studios, a spacious studio in downtown Los Angeles\u2019 Financial District.\n\nRhubbarb Studios is a venture builder that has emerged to become the tech center of Downtown Los Angeles.\nSome of the speakers included Connie Gallippi of BitGive, Steve Beauregard of GoCoin, Andew Lee of Purse.io, Paul Puey of Airbitz, Changetip\u2019s Nick Sullivan and Bitcoin Core Developer Jeff Garzik.\n\nThe event lasted 12 hours with multiple \u201cnetworking\u201d breaks. It was a more personal experience than most Bitcoin conferences. During talks and panel discussions, conference attendees were able to network in the large space.\nTopics covered included regulation, security, law, blockchain technology, investments in digital money, and merchant adoption of digital currency.\nA panel discussion covered merchant and mass adoption of digital currency and was moderated by Steve Beauregard, CEO and founder of GoCoin.com. The panel included Connie Chung, senior payments product manager at Expedia; Andrew Lee, Purse.io CEO; Paul Puey, CEO and co-founder of Airbitz; Justin Newton, CEO of Netki; and Nick Sullivan, founder of Changetip/Changecoin.\n\nThe panel explored some of the challenges to mass Bitcoin adoption, the main one being the current price of bitcoin. This has caused a relatively small number of customers paying with bitcoin in comparison to other payment methods.\nThe panelists discussed each other\u2019s contributions to the merchant space and presented how each group is working to spur Bitcoin adoption.\nGarzik\u2019s talk closed out the conference. He spoke to the audience about his initial skepticism of Bitcoin and his subsequent decision to work as a developer on the project, and communicated his vision for the future of Bitcoin.\n\nHe spoke of some \u201clayer-two\u201d type services to be released in Bitcoin\u2019s near future. Among them, \u201csmart transaction fees\u201d that determine how little a miner\u2019s fee you need to pay to get a transaction confirmed.\nOne of the newer features will allow bitcoin users to lock funds on the blockchain for specified periods of time. It\u2019s called BIP65, otherwise known as Check Lock Time Verify (CLTV).\n\u201cFrom the game theory perspective,\u201d said Garzik, \u201cthis reduces the risk of someone else cheating you.\u201d\nSome have proposed using it for anti-spam products where the user can commit any amount of value, such as a dollar, and get an anti-spam technology, he said.\nFor the longer term, he spoke of the possibility for improved real-time supply chain infrastructure on blockchain technology and a network of satellites that enable the blockchain to be broadcast in space and on most parts of Earth.\nBitcoin has been faster and more secure than BitTorrent since the new version was released earlier this year, Garzik said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the early stages of Bitcoin,\u201d he said \u201cThe services built on top of Bitcoin are just now being constructed.

We believe they have the right technical and financial backgrounds to make DWVx a significant player in the region.\u201d\nAlphapoint has supplied the infrastructure that Bitfinex, MeXBT, FlowBTC, CoinTrader and many other exchanges run on. The software company claims to provide latest exchange technology, including multi-signature security, fast transactions and reliable uptime.\nAn Increasingly Crowded Market\nEven with AlphaPoint\u2019s exchange infrastructure, it might prove difficult for DWVx to stand out in the already mature Australian Bitcoin market.\nVenture capital-backed Bitcoin exchanges Igot and Coinjar already have a sizeable portion of the market. And more recently, Independent Reserve entered the market with its own digital currency exchange, claiming to offer a more secure and reliable exchange.\nAustralia\u2019s Bitcoin ecosystem offers a robust offering, including advanced Bitcoin services. BTC.sx offers advanced trading tools, data and numerous levels of leverage. DigitalBTC, a local Bitcoin company, is even trading on the Australian Securities Exchange.\nCommunity With Cutting Edge Technology\nDWVx co-founders Davis and Clarke have backgrounds in finance and IT support and experience working for Barclays, IBM, Nationwide and Westpac bank.\n\u201cWe have been in active the local Bitcoin communities and tried many of the exchanges out,\u201d Davis said. \u201cExchanges ran by financial people tend to focus on customer support, while neglecting the technology. Techie people tend to focus on technology and forget customer support; we come from both areas.\u201d\nThe company hopes to stand out in the market with superb customer support and an active role in the western Australian Bitcoin community. DWVx will open an office in Perth, Australia.\n\u201cThere is a large and active Bitcoin community, but all the exchanges are on the east coast of the country,\u201d said Davis. \u201cBy really working on the customer support and experience, while also offering AlphaPoint\u2019s technology, we think we can make a real difference in the market.\u201d\n\u201cWe are extremely excited to deliver a state-of-the-art Bitcoin exchange, capable of up to one million transactions per second, and offering leading-edge security and reliability, all while maintaining a simple and user-friendly customer interface,\u201d added Clarke.\nThis personal approach is taken down even to their banking partners. DWVx\u2019s banking partner is Westpac, the second-largest Australian bank by assets. According to Clarke, the bank \u201cfully knows that we are a Bitcoin startup and what we do.\u201d Davis, who previously worked for the bank and met Gail Kelly, who was CEO of Westpac at the time, said the bank was \u201csurprisingly supportive and informed about cryptocurrency.\u201d\nBuilding The Brand\n\u201cAs Bitcoin continues to become more mainstream in Australia, our mission is to become a trusted source of information and education, through our extensive communications and customer interactions,\u201d said Davis. \u201cWhilst we may be the most remote exchange in the world, we pride ourselves on our accessibility and personal approach.\u201d\nOne of the main reasons the company decided to partner with AlphaPoint instead of building its own exchange is so it could focus on building its brand and customer experience. The duo plans on going to local startups and Bitcoin meetups to spread awareness and bring a face to the exchange.\nThey will also be putting the finishing touches on their local office, which will host regular Bitcoin presentations and even a co-working space.

The legal status of Bitcoin varies by country, but the Bank of Italy defines it as an unregulated digital decentralized virtual currency based on peer-to-peer, encryption on a shared blockchain.\nAccording to Italian Civil Code, the formation of a private limited company requires that the company have a minimum capital amount of \u20ac10,000. This minimum capital requirement means that business owners must make an initial contribution to the company.\nAccording to Art. 2464 of the Italian Civil Code, \u201c1. The value of the contributions may not be less than the total capital. 2. Any assets capable of economic assessment can contribute to capital.\u201d Based on that definition of capital contributions, Thomas Bertani incorporated a new private limited company using bitcoin.\nOn March 24, 2015, Bertani incorporated Oraclize Srl (Extract of Public Register) with a capital contribution of 45 bitcoin, which was registered by Public Notary Giacomo Pieraccini (Act of Incorporation).\n Stefano Capaccioli assisted with the incorporation to ensure proper identification, traceability and proof of property through the validation of the signature that manages the Bitcoin address. Capaccioli, CPA and auditor in Arezzo, Italy, is founder of AssoB.it, an Italian association that aims to represent businesses and promote the activities on blockchain technology.\n Bertani created a Bitcoin address during the incorporation, transferred 45 bitcoin, and delivered the private key to the appointed director. That transaction was included in block 349007.\nThis form of contribution is made during the process of incorporation. The transparency and traceability of this process is important, most notably during the passage of the ownership of bitcoin and verification of any further transaction. Making this contribution in bitcoin allows for additional transparency.\n\nThis process is similar to the one used by Spanish Bitcoin exchange Coinffeine, which used bitcoin as initial capital funding called \u201csocial capital\u201d in Spain. As in Italy, Spanish law permits the social capital for a corporation to be real goods rather than cash only. In this case, the four engineers who founded Coinffeine used bitcoin instead of Euros.\nThe newly incorporated company aims to build a platform (www.oraclize.it) for the creation of smart contracts, in which some bitcoin transactions can take place based on the occurrence of some verifiable real-life event, based on third-party services which were already acting as oracles such as Wolfram Alpha.\nOraclize brings the computable knowledge of these complex engines to the Bitcoin world. The main purpose is setting up a powerful platform to create and execute smart contracts while keeping the users in control of their funds, thanks to the use of multisig wallets.\nThis article has been updated to include information about Coinffeine\u2019s incorporation using bitcoin as social capital.", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 6}

Therefore, it seems likely that OneBit will make the life of daily bitcoin users much simpler and reduce their dependency on exchanges.\nThe direct involvement as a partner of MasterCard, whose APIs and SDKs are used together with those of BitPay to power the OneBit platform, may seem surprising to those who remember recent statements by MasterCard that indicated hostility to Bitcoin.\nIn a December 2014 submission to an Australian Senate inquiry, MasterCard urged regulators to move against the pseudonymity of digital currencies such as bitcoin.\n\u201cContrary to transactions made with a MasterCard product, the anonymity of digital currency transactions enables any party to facilitate the purchase of illegal goods or services; to launder money or finance terrorism; and to pursue other activity that introduces consumer and social harm without detection by regulatory or police authority,\u201d said the MasterCard statement.\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) recently replied to the same Senate inquiry by stating that it is unlikely that any benefits of Bitcoin regulation would outweigh the potential costs. RBA\u2019s head of payments policy Tony Richards also said that, while digital currencies are not legal tender, there is nothing to prevent two parties agreeing to settle a payment using a digital currency.\nPerhaps, after many similarly open-minded positions on Bitcoin taken by governments worldwide, MasterCard realizes that Bitcoin is here to stay and moving toward more integration with mainstream fintech.\nImage via OneBit.", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 8}

Following the likes of former JPMorgan Chase executive Blythe Masters and former JPMorgan Managing Director Paul Camp, Dienelt has made the move from traditional banking at Morgan Stanley Private Wealth Management to join the emerging digital currency industry as head treasurer of Factom .\nFactom, a Bitcoin 2.0 company creating a notarized audit trail with blockchain technology, has hired Dienelt as part of its focus on bitcoin asset management for its software token sale. Dienelt brings his experience managing a Futures Specialists desk at Morgan Stanley\u2019s New York office to the nascent Bitcoin industry. He graduated from Kenyon College in 2003 where he majored in Game Theory. After graduation, he worked at a private real estate asset management company performing REIT analysis.\nOn leaving his Wall Street job, Dienelt states, \u201cAfter two years traveling to Bitcoin conferences, mining, and running a paper wallet company, I\u2019m glad to have found a home in the space.\n\u201cFactom is the first non-financial application of the distributed ledger technology that will, over the next decade, change how people prove their data is authentic, and so much more. I spent almost ten years at Morgan Stanley, and I\u2019ll miss my friends and clients dearly. I just couldn\u2019t miss an opportunity to help shape such an important ecosystem as it develops. I\u2019m very excited to be working with [founders] Paul, David, Peter, and the rest of the team.\u201d\nFactom has been featured recently for their series of partnerships involving Bitcoin price stability with Tether, documenting gold exchange trades with Serica, and providing notarized audit trails for the Internet of Things with Rivetz.\nDavid Johnston, Chairman of the Factom Foundation, welcomed Dienelt to the team, saying, \u201cAs the world\u2019s large companies and institutions begin adopting blockchain technology, it naturally follows that their top people will get involved in projects such as Factom in order to be leaders in that transition.\u201d\nJohnston is referring to the recent trend of Wall Street executives who have left to join Bitcoin companies despite the public skepticism Bitcoin has received from banking executives. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, was quoted last March stating that \u2018Bitcoin [is] a terrible store of value that could be replicated over and over.\u2019\n\u201cThe question isn\u2019t whether we accept it,\u201d Dimon said in a recent interview with CNBC. \u201cThe question is, do we even participate in people who facilitate Bitcoin?\u201d\nUnlike Bitcoin companies which are focused on Bitcoin\u2019s use as a digital currency for payment solutions which Mr. Dimon is referring to, Factom is only using the technology of Bitcoin \u2013 namely the distributed ledger and consensus system that makes up the blockchain. Factom provides a distributed consensus and audit trail leveraging the Bitcoin blockchain. The company\u2019s open source platform stores a compressed and encoded version of data into the immutable blockchain record as a hash. Factom recently began a crowdsale of tokens supporting the development of the platform and has raised over 1000 bitcoins to date. Upon close of the token sale at the end of the month, Dienelt will be taking the lead on managing the bitcoin received during the sale, bringing his wealth of knowledge and experience from Morgan Stanley to Bitcoin 2.0.\nEditor\u2019s note: In the interest of full disclosure, Lisa Cheng is an advisor to the Factom project and does not hold any financial stake in the company.

We have the unique opportunity to craft a lasting legacy of delivering transparency, massive innovation and positive social impact to financial services and in peoples\u2019 everyday lives.\u201d\n\u201cAnthony will drive Bitreserve\u2019s efforts to inform industry leaders and work with members of the global financial services community to deliver transparency, portability and independence to current and future customers around the world,\u201d says Bitreserve founder and CEO Halsey Minor. \u201cHis knowledge and deep insight into financial systems is invaluable as we continue to grow and make strides towards a future that enables anyone to access and participate in the digital economy.\u201d\n\u201cI was itching to make an impact,\u201d Watson told Fortune. \u201cI wanted to do something that is valuable for people broadly, not just in one industry. And what Bitreserve is looking to achieve really democratizes finance. It\u2019s going to help people all over the world. The financial system is inherently unfair \u2013 it\u2019s always the richest who have access, and the poorest don\u2019t have access, or when they do, they have to pay astronomical rates.\u201d\nBitreserve solves bitcoin\u2019s volatility problem by enabling users to hold bitcoin as stable, real-world currencies. Bitreserve currently offers eight options: U.S. dollar, euro, U.K. pound, yen, yuan and the latest two additions \u2013 Indian rupee and Mexican peso.\nBitreserve, which also offers commodities \u2013 for now, the metals gold, silver, platinum and palladium \u2013 recently expanded to Mexico in partnership with its largest investor, Grupo Salinas CEO Ricardo Salinas-Pliego.\nWith this expansion, Bitreserve wants to grab a slice of the large market for remittances sent from migrant Mexican workers in the United States back to their families in Mexico. It is working in partnership with a major financial services company and community bank.\nThe plan combines the faster and cheaper remittances permitted by Bitcoin with the convenience of using the national currency.\nMinor told Fortune that \u201cthe great magical beauty of bitcoin\u201d is that it allows for the creation of financial institutions without having to go through the traditional financial system.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken the idea of Bitcoin and applied it to the world consumers already live in, rather than trying to force consumers into a new world that has high risk,\u201d he said.\nMinor\u2019s thoughts about the future of Bitcoin are especially interesting: \u201cI\u2019ll be surprised if Bitcoin is here in five years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a means to an end. The value of Bitcoin isn\u2019t the currency, but the technology. I think once the world becomes more accustomed and attuned to the platform of Bitcoin, the noise will go away, and the currency will go away, too.\u201d\nWatson is a high-profile spokesman for a growing number of workers who value work-life balance and refuse to sacrifice personal life for their career. As such, the Fortune article notes, he values the modern, distributed workplace at Bitreserve.\n\u201cMillennials don\u2019t want to or need to work in one big concrete building in one location,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how the world works anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people want to work remotely from home, some want to work from a coffee shop, some want to work at an office.\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 7}

The innovation lab, located in Level39\u2019s high growth space, HighGrowth:42, will explore the role of blockchain technology in financial services.\nUBS, a Swiss global financial services company with its headquarters in Basel and Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, provides investment banking, asset management and wealth management services for private, corporate, and institutional clients worldwide. Operating in more than 50 countries with about 60,000 employees around the world, UBS is the biggest Swiss bank and is considered as the world\u2019s largest manager of private wealth assets, with more than 2.2 trillion Swiss francs (CHF) in invested assets.\nEstablished by Canary Wharf Group plc, Level39 is Europe\u2019s largest technology accelerator space for finance, cyber-securities, retail and future cities technology companies. Six months after launching in March 2013, Level39 opened the High Growth Space: 42 on the 42nd floor of One Canada Square.\n\u201cBy establishing a dedicated innovation lab at Level 39 we are moving away from a purely in-house innovation strategy, optimizing collaboration opportunities with the growing FinTech business, startup and investor community in an open and transparent way,\u201d said UBS Group CIO Oliver Bussmann. \u201cOur innovation lab at Level39 will provide a unique platform to explore emerging technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies, and to understand the potential impact for the industry.\u201d\n\u201cThe UBS team have already established their credentials at Level39 over the last two years through mentoring alongside other leading experts at various accelerator programs,\u201d said Eric Van der Kleij, Head of Level39, Canary Wharf Group. \u201cOliver Bussmann\u2019s bold public statements and vision about the future of finance show that UBS is an organization that is genuinely determined to transform and thrive in a new world of finance.\u201d\nThe blockchain technology that powers Bitcoin can enable participants to share financial transactions on a common public ledger and, therefore, enhance transparency and trust while significantly reducing transaction and processing cost. Therefore, it has the potential to trigger far-reaching changes in banking processes.\nBy creating a dedicated lab for financial technology innovation at Level39, UBS will explore new technologies in partnership with others and will be fully involved in the innovation ecosystem.\n\u201cIt is always good news to see a global bank take a purposeful step outside of its traditional environment to work with \u2013 and learn from \u2013 the innovators who are helping to transform financial services,\u201d said FinTechCity Co-Founder Julie Lake.\nThe Wall Street Journalnotes that, while many in financial services have expressed an interest in the underlying technology of Bitcoin, UBS is one of the first major banks to go public with their plans. Bussmann said in October that the blockchain is the technology with the biggest potential to disrupt financial services and trigger massive simplification of banking processes and cost structure, changing not only the way we do payments but also the whole trading and settlement topic.\nThe Wall Street Journalarticle mentions other major banks, such as Barclays and Banco Santander, that are backing or launching initiatives to increase their interactions with the fintech start-up ecosystem as they seek to stay abreast of the rapid changes in technology which threaten their businesses.\n\n\u201cUBS sign\u201d by twicepix / CC BY-SA 2.0", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 3}

Thirty-four countries are now exposed to this beta.\n\u201cThe $24 trillion cross-border payments market is growing at a breakneck pace, expected to eclipse $54 trillion by 2022, despite a highly inefficient and expensive system in which businesses spend over $50 billion on wire and foreign exchange fees, wait up to seven days for transactions to complete and have no visibility into the process,\u201d said Marwan Forzley, CEO and Founder of Align Commerce, in a statement.\nAlign Commerce uses the blockchain to expedite money transfers. When transferring money through the normal banking system, numerous intermediaries each take a small fee. By eliminating that, the money can move much faster and for fewer fees.\nForzley explained the workflow in an email to Bitcoin Magazine: Business A pays its bill using a local payment system such as Automated Clearing House (ACH.) Business B gets paid via its own local payment system.\n\u201cThe speed of the payment end-to-end depends on the speed of the local payment systems, and that varies on a country-by-country basis,\u201d Forzley explained.\nWhat makes the tool particularly useful for potential businesses is that there are no changes to the way they do business.\n\u201cThe key is that there are significant advantages for the businesses using the blockchain in terms of savings in time and money,\u201d Forzley explained. \u201cIn addition, there is no change of behavior required. The blockchain is used behind the scene as a rail that moves fiat to fiat between two parties.\u201d\n\u201cAlign Commerce is the first company to successfully tackle international payments between businesses using the blockchain, allowing companies an easier, faster and less expensive option for cross-border transactions,\u201d said Dan Morehead, CEO at Pantera Capital, in the statement.\nAlign Commerce is able to cut the cost for businesses as well by cutting time it takes to process the payments and how many middlemen participate in the transfer. Only the company that has to change currencies pays a 1.9 percent exchange rate fee on top of the amount of money it wants to send. Therefore, the buyer has to pay the exchange rate fee.\nBusinesses might be worried about the volatility of Bitcoin while the payment is going from point A to point B. Though it is faster than traditional means, Align Commerce still can\u2019t have the payment transfer instantly because of local exchanges. But according to Forzley, the company manages any price volatility issues.\nUsing the blockchain to make faster payments around the world is a use case Bitcoin enthusiasts have been proponents of for a long time. Align Commerce hopes to finally fix that problem.\n\nDesigned by Freepik\n", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 4}
{"title": "How Bitcoin Can Help Millions of Women Around the World", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-can-help-millions-women-around-world-1428192021/", "birthday": "Apr 4, 2015  8:00 PM EST", "date": "2015-04-05 01:00:00", "content": "DCC member profile\nThis is a guest post by Digital Currency Councilmember Amor Sexton\nWestern Union released a reporton the role of women in global remittances. According to the report, women currently move 50 percent of the estimated $582 billion global remittances, and they send a greater percentage of their wages than men.\nWomen also are the largest group of recipients, receiving over two-thirds of remittances. The flow of money to these women can be a matter of life and death if they have no alternative means of earning a living. The United Nations reports that despite women working two-thirds of the world\u2019s working hours and producing more than 50 percent of the world\u2019s food, women earn only 10 percent of the world\u2019s income and own less than 1 percent of property.\nWith the flow of remittance having such a major impact on the lives of so many women, it is fitting during Bitcoin Women\u2019s Week to consider how digital currency may be able to help.\nHow can digital currency make a difference?\nThe global remittance market is ripe for disruption from a low-cost, frictionless value transfer mechanism such as Bitcoin. The remittance market is plagued by commercial monopolies, outrageous fees and opaque transfer records.\nThe World Bank reports that the average cost of sending money through commercial banks is around 12 percent, and the global weighted average cost of sending money through all channels is about 8 percent.\nAlternative remittance services can provide lower cost alternatives to commercial banks, but they often rely on risky internal processes such as \u201cnetting out.\u201d An example of a netting out process is where a person in Australia (Company A) has an agreement with a person in Cambodia (Company C). The sender in Australia pays Company A and the receiver in Cambodia is paid by Company C. However, no physical transfer of currency takes place between Company A and Company C.\nThese informal transfer systems present significant regulatory challenges due to the lack of transparency in the transactions. Effective monitoring of these systems is entirely reliant on the accuracy of the records that both Company A and Company C keep. It is a regulatory double-entry nightmare.\nOnline and account-to-account services still make up only around 17 percent to 20 percent of global money transfers. But the adoption of mobile technology will see the digitization of remittances increase rapidly in the near future. With estimates that mobile phone use in Africa alone will increase twentyfold in the next five years, and reports of smartphones retailing for less than $50, a mobile-driven digital currency such as bitcoin could find a comfortable home.\nThe Opportunities of Digitizing Payments report says that this mobile finance revolution could have a direct positive impact on women\u2019s economic empowerment. With women unable to access traditional banking services in many countries, the ability to use mobile technology to send and receive funds will facilitate financial inclusion for women.\nDigital currency also has the potential to solve both the cost and regulatory issues with remittance. Transfers on distributed ledgers, such as the blockchain, provide a transparent public record of transactions that can be settled for nominal amounts.\nTechnology such as Eris Industries\u2019distributed application stack can take this a step further by enabling distributed ledger technology to be employed in an internally fully auditable, yet externally private transfer system.\nBitcoin companies such as BitPesa, Rebit.ph and igot.com are actively working on opening remittance corridors and using bitcoin to facilitate the flow of money in a cost-effective and transparent manner. With BitPesa in Africa, Rebit.ph in the Philippines, and igot.com in more than 40 countries, bitcoin is starting to make a splash in the remittance markets.\nWith a presence in both the United Arab Emirates and India, igot.com operates a strong remittance corridor between these two countries. In the Philippines, Rebit.ph reports that they had more volume in February 2015 than their entire volume since they launched. The low transfer cost also has resulted in transactions as low as $10USD being made on their platform.\nWhat challenges does digital currency face?\nA significant challenge for digital currency remittance businesses is the cost of regulatory compliance. As Juan Llanos (contrarian compliance consultant extraordinaire) regularly points out \u2013 compliance is more than just having a written policy document. Substantive regulatory compliance requires constant monitoring of transactions and vigilance in the identification and authentication of customers.\nRick Day, co-founder of igot.com, reported recently that his company has stopped more than $1.2 million in fraudulent transactions in the last 6 months alone. This hasn\u2019t been an easy process. To reach this level of fraud detection, igot.com has had to introduce extra KYC measures such as Skype verifications, and intensive manual oversight of the transaction monitoring system. Vigilance is resource-intensive and costly.\nIn the very near future, technology like Subledger\u2019s Continuous Real-time Auditing project or Coinalytics\u2019 AML risk profiling may increase efficiency and reduce costs. If they do, it will be another way that distributed ledger technology has helped improve the remittance process.\nFor the billions of women around the world who rely on remittances, this can only be a good thing.\n\nImage by Jim Holmes-AusAID / CC BY 2.0", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 5}

This new service will put the company head-to-head with some of the largest payment processors in the market.\n\u201cAccepting bitcoin through igot has multiple advantages for merchants. Integration take just minutes, and it protects businesses from both credit-card chargebacks and price volatility,\u201d said Rick Day, co-founder of the company, in a statement.\nThe company believes it has a competitive advantage because it can facilitate cross-border payment in nearly 40 countries, allowing businesses to cash out in any of those currencies. According to igot, integration is simple, which is important since they\u2019re working with online businesses.\n\u201cOur primary focus is online stores, and we do not expect huge numbers of signups from brick-and-mortar businesses at this time,\u201d Day said in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cOver time, we will work with POS solutions to integrate igot\u2019s service into their existing hardware. Right now, accepting bitcoin requires almost no effort from the merchant and, once sales start coming in, igot automatically converts the bitcoin to fiat currency and places it in the merchant\u2019s bank account.\u201d\nThe company will charge a 0.5 percent fixed transaction fee. There are no interchange or currency conversion fees. And because the user can instantly convert the bitcoin into a local fiat currency, the merchant doesn\u2019t have to worry about the volatility of bitcoin.\nWorking in so many countries, though, seems like it could open the company up to regulatory hurdles. Day told Bitcoin Magazine that most of the countries igot operates in don\u2019t require much licensing.\n\u201cWe strictly follow our KYC and AML policies in every jurisdiction in which we operate,\u201d Day said. \u201cAs yet, most of these countries do not require us to obtain a Money Service Business license. Even so, we already collect data and report all cases that would be required of us if we were an MSB. This means, as governments around the world start to establish regulatory frameworks, we will be instantly ready to comply.\u201d\nLike with the other payment platforms, the majority of the sales made are being instantly converted to the local fiat currency rather than being kept in bitcoin. According to Day, fewer than 5 percent of businesses that use igot are holding onto any bitcoin. But Day does see ways that adoption will grow for the digital currency.\n\u201cTo begin with, bitcoin has to be made far less technical,\u201d he said. \u201cNot everyone wants to know how dollar bills are printed, why they are printed the way they are or how the powers that be determine the right number to print. The average consumer just wants to use their dollar bills.\n\u201cAs long as we can make it easier for them [the average customer] to convert dollars to bitcoin and back with a simple push notification, bitcoin will make more sense,\u201d Day said. \u201cAlso, as big retailers, investors, and governments increasingly take interest in the technology, we will see the beginning of mass adoption.\u201d\n\nImage via igot.", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 8}

The group can directly invest $20,000 per startup and tap into the larger funds of Orange Digital Ventures, the venture capital arm of Orange, which plans to support 500 startups worldwide by 2020 as outlined in its \u201cEssentials 2020\u201d strategy plan.\nThe Bloomberg article notes that venture capital investments in digital currency startups hit an all-time quarterly high of $233.95 million in the first quarter of 2015.\nIt may seem odd that Orange is planning to invest in Silicon Valley startups when there is plenty of talent in France and throughout Europe, but Nahon is persuaded that Silicon Valley still has an edge when it comes to disruptive technology development.\n\u201cHere\u2019s where the spark of digital innovation is located and how the communication ecosystem is rapidly evolving,\u201d he wrote in February. \u201cThis is why Orange Silicon Valley is in the San Francisco Bay Area. We\u2019re here to work with companies to actively participate in these disruptive innovations.\u201d\nAccording to Nahon, the digital payments space will begin to see a marriage of new tech with incumbent institutions, which will opt for acquiring smaller, more agile and mobile-based startups, reminiscent of when mobile advertising firms were rapidly purchased in the past two years.\nThe Bloomberg article reports that, according to Nahon, Bitcoin technology could be used to cheaply transfer money between different countries. Orange already has more than 12 million users for its money transfer service Orange Money in Africa and the Middle East, and is looking to expand the business.\nBut Nahon realizes that the blockchain technology can have far-reaching implications beyond money transfer.\n\u201cCryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin will remain a popular topic, but the focus starting in 2015 will be the adoption of blockchain,\u201d Nahon wrote in January. \u201cDevelopers and companies will flock to the technology in pursuit of developing the \u2018blockchain killer application.\u2019 Innovation like this will have implications far beyond payments, as it\u2019ll be a new way for us to trust each other more generally, and facilitate changes in how society exchanges things of value.\u201d\nHe added that new sources of funding and support for tech startups will come from renewed accelerators and incubators.\nA related initiative is Orange Fab, the startup accelerator for Orange. It\u2019s a three-month program that works with exceptional startups that are changing how people connect and communicate.

Coinsetter, which specializes in institutional trading for investment firms, is confident it can win back all of Cavirtex\u2019s old customers in Canada and grow its presence there.\nCavirtex may have stiff competition in Canada\nIn a bold statement, Coinsetter CEO Jaron Lukasiewicz was quoted as saying there were currently no good exchanges for the Canadian market. In fact, he said, \u201cEvery single exchange that currently exists in Canada is very poor quality, it\u2019s almost unbelievable\u2026the other options in that market are very bad.\u201d\nAfter Vault of Satoshi and Cavirtex closed down earlier this year, Canadian exchange QuadrigaCX comfortably slipped into first place in the Canadian market.\nResponding to comments by Lukasiewicz, Gerald Cotten, Founder and CEO of QuadrigaCX, told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cWe welcome the additional interest in the Canadian digital currency space. We will work hard to continue providing the best trading experience for all of our clients.\u201d\nRegulations not really an issue\nThere was speculation at the time Cavirtex closed down that new federal regulations and a new set of regulations local to Quebec were factors in Cavirtex\u2019s decision.\nBut Amber Scott, digital currencies specialist and Chief AML Ninja at Outlier Solutions had always said that she doubted that regulations by Canada or Quebec regulations were a factor in Cavirtex\u2019s closing.\n\u201cI would say that Cavirtex took steps to be prepared for regulation relatively early on,\u201d Scott told Bitcoin Magazine.

Because of missed payments, MPC cut power to GAW\u2019s facility on January 27, 2015.\nMPC wants the court to award it the cost of the remaining eight months on the contract plus the cost of installing the unique transformers, which is $73,493.48. On top of that, MPC also wants GAW to pay the $223,818.61 that was owed to the power company at the time power was cut off to the facility. Due to this, MPC argues it has incurred damages equal to $346,647.29, not including interest, costs, and any attorney\u2019s fees.\nTheir argument is that because MPC provided a service that GAW never paid for, MPC has suffered certain damages that they believe should be recoverable.\nRough Times for GAW Miners\nAccording to research conducted by CoinFire, the Securities and Exchange Commission have opened an investigation into GAW Miners and its owner, Josh Garza. While the SEC has not yet drafted any enforcement action, there are over 1,000 pages of investigation. With this lawsuit, it appears that GAW and Garza have a long uphill legal battle ahead of them with the government and the utilities all looking for a piece.\n\nImage by Fayerollinson / CC BY-SA 3.0", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 10}

While invoicing is a free service, other features are offered at an additional cost.\nConnecting a Coinbase account and adding bitcoin as a payment and invoicing option will cost users $1.95 per month.\nWith clients in more than 140 countries worldwide already, Hiveage is planning a major push into the EU market, beginning with the Netherlands and Germany. Adding new payment services options, including bitcoin, is an important part of their global expansion strategy.\n\u201cCoinbase has a very strong position in the U.S., and they\u2019re actively expanding in Europe,\u201d said Sirisena. \u201cThis aligns well with our plans, too: The majority of our customers are from the U.S., but this year we\u2019re focusing on making Hiveage an attractive option for the European market, where 20 percent of our customers come from.\u201d\nThe company decided to focus on Amsterdam as a starting point after attending the Uprise Startup Festival in March.

The focus is on projects that are already in progress, that show a clear direction and that have a methodology for reporting on progress and outcomes.\nWhile businesses and developers need not be considered not-for-profit, projects must be open-source with a distinguishable public benefit in order to be eligible for consideration.\n\u201cFueled by what can only be described as impassioned determination, developers from all walks of life have risked their time and credibility to pioneer in this radical and largely unknown domain of innovation,\u201d Davis states in the blog post. \u201cToday we are launching a new program to support and thank those who continue to take this journey with us.\u201d\nThe size of the grants will range from USD $1,000 to $10,000 per project and will be determined by the \u00d0\u039eVgrants administrator and board through a two-step evaluation process.

A former CEO of Creative Commons , Ito also has served on the boards of the Open Source Initiative, ICANN, The Mozilla Foundation, Public Knowledge and the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC).\nIn collaboration with other high profile MIT experts such as economist Simon Johnson and cryptographer Ron Rivest, Ito plans for MIT to become a non-commercial, neutral place for academics to talk about Bitcoin.\n\u201cI think within a couple of weeks we\u2019ll be announcing something which will be a little bit more substantive,\u201d says Ito. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not pushing it, but I\u2019m offering MIT as a neutral academic home for some of the conversations and the technical coordination. Which I think will give a lot more stability to Bitcoin, which right now is a little bit fragile.\u201d\nThe Bitcoin ecosystem doesn\u2019t have a central governing body, but the Bitcoin Foundation probably is the closest thing. However, the short history of the foundation has been troubled by rumors and scandals, and there has been opposition to the foundation\u2019s leadership in the Bitcoin community. Recently, Bitcoin Foundation board member Olivier Janssens wrote that the foundation had been undermined by \u201ctwo years of ridiculous spending and poorly thought-out decisions\u201d and was \u201ceffectively bankrupt.\u201d\nIn view of the troubled history of the Bitcoin Foundation, which is now considering splitting into two separate organizations for promotional activities and core development funding, it seems likely that the Bitcoin community as a whole could welcome MIT as a more suitable, prestigious venue for leadership and coordination of the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019d like to do as a contribution from MIT \u2013 and this is one of my first forays into going Institute-wide from the beginning, by bringing Simon Johnson for the economics and Ron Rivest for the crypto \u2013 is to try to come up with a non-commercial, neutral place for academics to talk about Bitcoin,\u201d says Ito. \u201cWhat I\u2019m really trying to do is offer us as one of the neutral places to do this. And I do think academia plays a role.\u201d\nIto published his first Bitcoin essay in January. In the essay, titled \u201cWhy Bitcoin is and isn\u2019t like the Internet ,\u201d he explores parallels, similarity and differences between the history of Bitcoin, the new digital currency of the Internet, and the history of the Internet itself. An important difference is that the financial establishment, which mostly left the Internet alone at the beginning, has been substantially involved in the early development of cryptocurrencies.\nIto summarizes this point for Xconomy:\n\u201cWith Bitcoin, it was sort of on the Internet, but the financial interests got very involved before there was a lot of standards-setting,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s going at hyperspeed, much faster than any other standards body. And you have the added problem that there\u2019s a lot of money involved. \u201c\nBefore the Xconomy interview, Ito outlined his developing plans at the MIT Bitcoin Expo 2015 in March. He thinks MIT could and should provide a neutral and prestigious academic home for the development of blockchain standards, technologies and best practices, independent of the powerful commercial and regulatory interests that are forming around the emerging digital economy.\nThe full video recordings of the MIT Bitcoin Expo 2015 are available online.

Schulman, President and CEO-Designee of PayPal Holdings. \u201cThe access to and movement of money is an important market that affects the lives of almost everyone.

Braintree permits merchants to accept bitcoin payments seamlessly in partnership with Coinbase, allowing their customers to pay with bitcoin instantly and securely on any device without manually transferring bitcoin or scanning QR codes. The Braintree bitcoin payments service, currently in public beta, has zero transaction fees on the first $1 million in bitcoin sales and a 1 percent fee for cashing out bitcoin to a bank account.\n\u201cSell your products and services in the currency of your choice and let your customers pay with Bitcoin,\u201d reads Braintree\u2019s invitation to its clients. \u201cWe take care of the conversion, transfer, and transaction reporting that fits in with your existing Braintree workflow. Bitcoin transactions are confirmed in less than a few seconds, eliminating chargebacks, which reduces your exposure to online fraud.\u201d\nBesides bitcoin, PayPal allows merchants to accept Apple Pay and Venmo payments via Braintree.\nThe separation of eBay and PayPal, which will take place in 2015 (no exact date is given in the SEC filing) will allow the two companies to more effectively pursue distinct operating priorities and strategies and opportunities for long-term growth and profitability. In particular, PayPal\u2019s management will be able to focus exclusively on its payments business, and enjoy \u201cincreased flexibility to pursue new partnership and strategic opportunities that may have previously been unavailable for strategic or other reasons.\u201d\nIt seems likely that the increased flexibility and exclusive focus on online payments could result in PayPal taking a more active role in the Bitcoin ecosystem.", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 10}

{"title": "Eliminate Short-Term Capital Gains for Warp-Speed Bitcoin Adoption", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/eliminate-short-term-capital-gains-warp-speed-bitcoin-adoption-1428793832/", "birthday": "Apr 11, 2015  7:10 PM EST", "date": "2015-04-12 00:10:00", "content": "here\nThis is a guest post from Digital Currency Council member Kirk Phillips.\nThe burden of managing a tax calculation every time you buy something with bitcoin creates adoption friction that\u2019s counterintuitive to the frictionless nature of bitcoin that we all know and love. (More on this in my article titled, \u201cA Gift from the IRS and the Coffee Problem.\u201d) So what if there was a better way to align the tax rules with the uses and benefits of bitcoin, to naturally accelerate adoption? How about eliminating short-term capital gains rules for bitcoin and other digital currencies?\nOld world ways\nMost folks generally understand the tax implications of using bitcoin by now, which includes having to track bitcoin to calculate a gain or loss whenever you buy a cup of coffee. Bitcoin may have become a victim of its own volatility when the IRS, during its decision-making process, was perhaps looking at the rise of bitcoin without considering price drops. Nonetheless, the application of property rules with short-and long-term capital gains is consistent with the taxation of any other assets going up and down in value. Bitcoin, however, deserves an exception, one that will take us into warp-speed and mass adoption.\nBitcoin simultaneously encompasses two wonderful traits of money, serving as both a store of value as well as a medium of exchange. The frictionless, almost instant transfer of value speaks for itself by transforming the Stone-Age model full of fees and headaches we\u2019ve come to expect. Bitcoin has a magical store of value component because it\u2019s a self-contained system combining a currency, a protocol and a network into something useful and scarce. The IRS short-term capital gains rules, as pointed out in the coffee reference, erroneously add friction to bitcoin\u2019s otherwise frictionless medium of exchange. Ironically, the very same rules are like a gift from the IRS when applied to bitcoin\u2019s store of value. Long-term holds of bitcoin or any other asset have the lowest possible tax rates \u2014 15 percent in some cases \u2014 compared to ordinary income as high as 39.6 percent.\nExploring a new frontier\nA few IRS rule changes could easily transform this strange dichotomy into a slam-dunk for bitcoin. My assertion is simple: The cost of supporting the rules is greater than the benefit. The aggregate cost of compliance for taxpayers, combined with the IRS costs to administer the rules, outweighs the benefits to the U.S. Treasury.\nHere are just a few of the most obvious costs:\nIRS staff training on understanding digital currenciesIRS staff training on how to field bitcoin-related questionsIRS resources spent on processing tax returns with pages and pages of bitcoin transactions (an effort that diverts resources away from areas that produce a higher return)\nTo illustrate this wasted use of resources further, let\u2019s take data sets from individuals and businesses, while assuming the transactions were in an all-bitcoin world, and calculate the net gain or loss at the end of a year. An analysis of 2014 would likely result in a net gain close enough to zero to justify eliminating the short-term capital gains rules for bitcoin and other digital currencies. For bitcoin to become a truly frictionless medium of exchange, these rules need to be eliminated. Meanwhile, long-term gains for bitcoin held longer than one year would remain intact because larger, infrequent transaction amounts are easy to track. It\u2019s also consistent with taxation of asset appreciation related to bitcoin\u2019s store of value property.\nA long-term relationship\nThe modification I\u2019m proposing creates the perfect dance between store of value and medium of exchange while making things easier for the IRS and the taxpayer. If a business or individual holds bitcoin for 10 months, the question they will ask is: Do I want to continue holding bitcoin into the long-term capital gain zone or use it now for things I need anyway? Those in the game for a long-term play won\u2019t flinch and those who are not will spend the bitcoin and get it flowing again.\nIn addition, the IRS \u201cwash sale rules\u201d would apply, essentially prohibiting a repurchase of the same cryptocurrency within 60 days of a sale. The wash sale rules normally prohibit sales and repurchase of securities within 30 days so taxpayers can\u2019t recognize a loss. In this context, however, it would extend the 30-day period to 60 days to thwart the game of resetting the clock on a long-term hold. The wash rules would not apply if bitcoin was used to purchase goods or services. It applies only when bitcoin is sold for USD. For example, if you use bitcoin to buy office supplies, you can\u2019t turn around and use office supplies to buy back bitcoin. On the other hand, if you sell bitcoin for USD you can use the USD to buy back bitcoin, which is why I\u2019m proposing a modified wash sale rule.\nIf you don\u2019t like the above example, consider these alternatives:\nIncrease long-term capital gains to 22.5 percent\nIf the IRS were to eliminate short-term gains, then let\u2019s increase the long-term rate to 22.5 percent to offset the revenue that would have been gained from short-term gains, while still remaining a bargain for the taxpayer. Within the current system, collectibles, such as paintings, antiques and baseball cards, have a special tax rate of 28 percent; therefore, bitcoin and other digital currencies should be able to have a special tax rate.\nImplement de minimis transaction relief\nTransactions for purchases of goods or services less than $100 would not be subject to short-term capital gains (for individuals). Similarly, transactions less than $250 would not be subject to short-term capital gains (for businesses). Long-term term capital gains rates would still apply to bitcoin held longer than one year.\nEstablish a volatility threshold\nBoth individual and business taxpayers would be exempt from short-term capital gains when the price of bitcoin fluctuates within a volatility threshold. As long as the highest price at any point during the year is less than 150 percent of the lowest price during the year, then no transactions will be subject to short-term capital gains tax. For example, if the lowest price was $400 and the highest price was $595 then no capital gains would apply because 150 percent of $400 is $600 and $595 is less than $600. In this case as well, long-term term capital gains rates would still apply to bitcoin held longer than one year.\nCreate a 5-year short-term capital gain exclusion\nUnder this exclusion, all bitcoin transactions for purchases of goods or services, for both individuals and businesses, would be exempted from short-term capital gains. This proposed five-year sunset is consistent with other sunsetting provisions that end temporary relief. Long-term term capital gains rates would still apply.\nAny of these proposed changes would likely come with unintended consequences, but progress always comes with growing pains. Any new rules that stimulate bitcoin adoption, reduce taxpayer burden, and give the IRS a fair share, should be welcomed.\nHow would you change the IRS rules?", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 12}

Consider the difficulty a small mom & pop shop would have trying to integrate a second system for accepting payments. By working through these traditional payment providers, they can accept bitcoin without even knowing they are.\nLast week, Julia Patterson, communications manager at BitPay, a competitor of Bitnet, told Bitcoin Magazine that traditional payment companies are not opposed to accepting bitcoin.\n\u201cBusinesses working in the traditional payments industry are usually excited about getting involved with Bitcoin once all of their skepticism has been addressed,\u201d she said. \u201cNo large payments company is going to adopt Bitcoin on a whim.\u201d\nFor Bitnet, partnering with Cardinal Commerce opens an avenue for fast adoption.\n\u201cCardinal is the \u2018go-to\u2019 provider for cutting-edge payments solutions, so it is no surprise that our friends at Cardinal are as excited as we are at Bitnet to help merchants eliminate fraud while reducing processing costs through bitcoin acceptance,\u201d said co-founder and CEO of Bitnet, John McDonnell.\n\nBackground by Freepik", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 25}

The first has to do with money laundering requirements. According to Wilson, \u201cVirtual currency exchangers and administrators are already required to comply with federal AML regulations. In many ways this is a good thing. FinCEN (the federal money laundering regulator) set a clear federal standard for all bitcoin companies in March 2013.\u201d\nWhere this becomes a problem for Wilson is that a state-by-state requirement becomes tremendously arduous. The basic question is: If the Federal Government already has a rule, why make\u00a0another\u00a0rule?\nCoinbase also was against this requirement. In a blog post, the company said: \u201cThe result would indiscriminately force all Coinbase customers in New York to pay a toll, vis-a-vis aggressive personal disclosure and verification procedures, as a prerequisite to establishing a Coinbase account.\u201d (https://blog.coinbase.com/2015/02/27/bitlicense-part-two/)\nAnd Coin Center agrees. \u201cThe BitLicense\u2019s AML requirements go too far, imposing costs onto Bitcoin businesses that are not borne by any other money transmission business under state or federal law,\u201d Peter Van Valkenburgh, Director of Research at Coin Center, wrote.\nBut it\u2019s not just the Anti-Money Laundering rules that are onerous. Wilson also talks about how every virtual currency company is, by default, regulated as a money transmission business. \u201cThe Bitlicense requires similar provisions to what is already in place for money transmitters under state regulations, thus creating duplicative and redundant compliance obligations, which, again, could end up being replicated in all fifty states around the country,\u201d he wrote on his blog.\nPrimarily, what Wilson, Coinbase, and Coin Center are arguing for is equal treatment like any other money transmitting business. The companies are not looking to avoid regulation; rather, they are simply looking to be regulated like any other comparable business.\nCoin Center took things much farther than just Mr. Wilson and Coinbase, offering their entire public comment that was delivered to the New York State Department of Financial Services. Their entire comments can be seen here.

The same observations he makes about CoinDesk's representation of the entire Bitcoin community apply equally to Bitcoin Magazine.\n\u201cMaking assumptions simply means believing things are a certain way with little or no evidence that shows you are correct, and you can see at once how this can lead to terrible trouble.\u201d -\u00a0Lemony SnicketCoinDesk, one of the premier outlets for news and analysis on digital currencies, has made a request of its readers.\nFill in this survey, they asked, and we can finally put to rest whether the statement \u201cthe bitcoin community largely consists of young, white males\u201d is true.But will their survey give us such an answer?\nThe contribution CoinDesk has made to the bitcoin community is unquestionable.\nThe team has worked to legitimize digital currencies in the eyes of journalists in the mainstream media by providing a consistently reliable source of information.\nBut their market research skills leave much to be desired and threaten to damage their otherwise healthy reputation for quality information.CoinDesk\u2019s survey error lies in their assumption that their readers mirror the demographics of the wider Bitcoin community\n.This is highly unlikely to be the case for two predominant reasons.\nOne: CoinDesk is an English-Only Outlet\nOn the one hand we have the huge amount of Bitcoin trade in China.\nOn the other, according to CoinDesk\u2019s \"State of Bitcoin 2015\" report, we saw new Bitcoin-related venture capital investment in 2014 in Japan, the Netherlands, Panama, Denmark, Luxembourg, Sweden, Germany, India, Mexico and Argentina.All of those countries have (at least) one thing in common: English is not the mother tongue.\nMany of those countries are precisely the countries that will disprove the theory that bitcoiners are white American guys.\nWhy would non-English speakers visit CoinDesk to take a survey if they cannot read the language that it publishes its content in?\nTo put it another way, I am very interested in Middle Eastern politics but I have no idea when Al Hayat last ran a survey. Why?\u00a0\nBecause I don\u2019t speak Arabic and so I never visit the site.\nI also had no idea Al Hayat even existed until I Googled \u201ctop newspapers in Arabic.\u201d\nTwo: Media Consumption Habits Vary\nThere is a second methodological fail: CoinDesk has assumed that the diversity of bitcoiners is fully and accurately represented by CoinDesk readers.\nCoinDesk, as with every other media title, will have an appeal to a specific demographic.Google can build a monopoly in the online search market because, to a large degree, we all want the same thing from a search provider: Give us what we\u2019re looking for and do it quickly.\nBut no single media title can cater for everyone\u2019s different tastes. We all want something different, whether that is political affiliation, content type or publication format.\nAs a case in point, despite all four being hubs of the bitcoin community, it is unlikely that Bitcointalk.org, Zapchain, the Digital Currency Council and CoinDesk all have the same user demographics.\nIf CoinDesk\u2019s readers are weighted towards a specific demographic, then how can interviewing their readers give us an accurate picture of the broader Bitcoin community?(And if you wanted to be really picky, how can you be sure that specific demographics aren\u2019t more inclined to actually take the survey rather than ignoring it?)\nThe Changing Nature of Bitcoiners\nIn his blog of March 4th 2015, Ryan Selkis/TBI discusses the possibility of Abra being Bitcoin\u2019s first killer app.\nSelkis calls out the fact that the Abra CEO doesn\u2019t mention Bitcoin once in his presentation to the Launch Festival 2015 (which Abra went on to win).\nThis is a clever move on Abra\u2019s part given Bitcoin\u2019s toxic reputation. But importantly for us, it tells us that there may be a large number of bitcoiners who don\u2019t even know that they are bitcoiners.\nIf they don\u2019t even know that they are bitcoiners, will a survey on CoinDesk help us figure out who they are?\u00a0", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 30}

Factom is described as \u201ca data layer for the blockchain\u201d that will help businesses manage their data.\nTo gain access to that Factom network, though, requires Factoids, a digital token designed specifically for the Factom network. Starting tomorrow, these new coins will be available for sale. However, they will not be dispersed until May 15th.\nThis is where ShapeShift comes into play. ShapeShift allows for users to instantly convert from one cryptocurrency to the other. A user could trade their bitcoin instantly for litecoin or convert from dogecoin to Ripple. This ease of transferring from one currency to the other is the catalyst for this partnership.\n\u201cFactom will be listing ShapeShift as a recommended way for Factoid Software Sale participants that do not have bitcoin to get BTC for other digital tokens,\u201d explained David Johnston, Chairman of the Factom Foundation. The second part of this agreement will introduce Factom onto the ShapeShift platform so that users could easily convert in and out of the currency. This part of the partnership, Johnston explained, wouldn\u2019t happen until after May 15thwhen the software sale finished.\n\u201cOur team spent substantial time researching the technologies and protocols available to build scalable blockchain based applications and the conclusion we reached is that Factom had a solid approach and architecture for publishing and securing general data to the blockchain and so we decided to integrate their digital token into our platform,\u201d said Erik Voorhees, ShapeShift CEO, in a written statement to Bitcoin Magazine.\nThis partnership means that any user that wants to exchange in and out of Factoids once they launch can utilize ShapeShift\u2019s platform. This makes ShapeShift the first partner to integrate Factoid tokens. In addition, there are no fees associated with transferring between Factoid and any other currency beyond the typical exchange rate, which is based on the market rate of Factoids.\nBlockchain scalability remains a topic that many in the bitcoin community debate. Even Gavin Andresen, the chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, has talked extensively about the need for scalability on the blockchain. Originally, the size of one block was infinite, but due to denial-of-service attacks, Satoshi rolled the size back to one megabyte. (https://blog.bitcoinfoundation.org/a-scalability-roadmap/)\nBy taking any data, as Factom does, and processing it on a layer above the blockchain to encoding it all down into one hash, the data can still be verified on the blockchain. In addition, this approach minimizes bloat on the blockchain as only data hashes are stored. This partnership will facilitate the ability for users to acquire Factoid and begin using the network.\nThis article has been updated to reflect the fact that ShapeShift is only the first partner to integrate the Factoid tokens and the partnership is not exclusive.", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 31}

The recent wave of Wall Street interest in Bitcoin technology is inspired by a growing appreciation of the inevitability of radical changes in the financial industry, which is long overdue for the kind of Internet-driven cost savings that have affected other industries.\nThe emphasis is on efficiency and cost-effectiveness: Bitcoin technology could slash costs, cut settlement times and reduce default risks. The Journal mentions several recent digital fintech news items, including investment opportunities, announcements, acquisitions and appointments of high-profile financial professionals, reported by Bitcoin Magazine in the last few weeks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for Wall Street to streamline some operations that are pretty antiquated,\u201d says Duncan Niederauer, the former chief executive of NYSE Euronext. Niederauer is now an adviser to TeraExchange, the first Commodities Futures Trading Commission-regulated Bitcoin derivatives platform.\n\u201cNot only [is Bitcoin not] a threat, it\u2019s potentially an opportunity,\u201d Niederauer said. \u201cIf the train\u2019s leaving the station, you\u2019d rather be on it and be the conductor than a bystander on the platform.\u201d\nOther high-profile banking executives worldwide express similar views: The financial industry should jump on the digital fintech bandwagon and appropriate Bitcoin technology for increased efficiency at reduced cost.\nSpeaking at the Morgan Stanley European Financials Conference in London, Barclays\u2019 CEO Antony Jenkins warned the \u201cbanking sector has not yet felt the \u2018full disruptive force\u2019 of technology \u2013 but it will.\u201d He elaborated on the growing concern among financial institutions that faster, cheaper payment systems will start to seduce their consumer and business customers in the coming years.\n\u201cIn a world where growth is harder to come by,\u201d Jenkins said, citing the ongoing cost- and jobs-cutting measures in the banking sector, \u201cI\u2019m more convinced than ever that costs will remain the strategic battleground for our sector over the coming years.\u201d\nJenkins\u2019 remarks don\u2019t mention Bitcoin explicitly, but it\u2019s clear that the faster and cheaper transactions permanently recorded in a public tamper-proof ledger, permitted by Bitcoin, represent a growing threat to traditional, cost-inflated banking operations.\n\u201cApple pay doesn\u2019t change the way payments happen,\u201d notes Mariano Belinky, who runs Banco Santander\u2019s $100 million venture fund Innoventures. \u201cBut it\u2019s the blockchain-like technologies and the decentralized ledger \u2013 that will be source of real innovation.\u201d\nBelinky, who before joining Santander was a strategy adviser at McKinsey & Co., is persuaded that mainstream adoption by the financial industry is the future of digital currencies.\n\u201cBitcoin has the wrong set of advocates and affiliates. Evangelists highlighting the anonymous, untraceable nature of the technology have tarnished its reputation. A bank won\u2019t get involved with bitcoin if there\u2019s a perception it has links to money laundering or terrorism,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m excited about Stellar, Ethereum, Ripple \u2013 the same technology but coming from a completely different angle \u2013 making payments more efficient for the financial industry.\u201d\nA recent article from Credit Suisse also underlines the potential of digital currencies to cut costs and streamline financial operations.\n\u201cWhen combined with the traditional financial system, bitcoins could have cost advantages over credit cards or providers such as Western Union when used as a transaction system,\u201d notes the report.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 30}

An army of attorneys is being built who will compete to be your representative if you happen to need them during an encounter with police. Sidekik seeks to connect attorneys with potential clients when they need legal representation the most.\nThe Sidekik team says there is an inherent power imbalance between law enforcement and civilians during these encounters, as \u201cthe vast majority of people do not know their rights well enough and tend to crumble under the pressure.\u201d\nEssential evidence also tends to be scarce, too often turning court testimony into a your-word-against-mine scenarios, which the Sidekik team believes tilts the balance of justice in favor of law enforcement.\nThe app is designed to gather as much relevant information as possible, including GPS location, audio and video, while calling licensed attorneys via video to deal with the encounter lawfully.\nConcerns about data storage lead Martin to Maidsafe, a decentralized storage company currently in closed beta.\nThe value of decentralized storage\nDuring an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Martin expounded on the need for secure cloud storage of this sensitive information and the company\u2019s relationship with Maidsafe.\n\u201cThe concern is totally valid about having data centralized, any data,\u201d Martin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about being able to store video and making it so that whatever entity cannot hack into one server and destroy that video. It\u2019s about a lot more than that; it is about contact lists, it\u2019s about people\u2019s confidential information.\n\u201cPeople get notices all the time from different companies that they do business with, such as credit card companies or maybe their schools, saying \u2018Hey our servers got hacked, your Social Security number, your birth date, your name, someone has it,'\u201d he said. \u201cWith Maidsafe that really is a thing of the past, there\u2019s no more hacking that one server and grabbing all that data.\u201d\nMartin said he met Page Peterson of Maidsafe at Libertopia in San Diego last November and had his CTO Jessie Wallace talk to her about how Sidekik could use Maidsafe for the massive amounts of data that will be coming from the app.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be storing the data on multiple secure servers, but those are centralized,\u201d Martin said. \u201cSo we are also going to be working with Maidsafe \u2026 This is a perfect merger with them in terms of features. This way, there will not be one single place where the powers-that-be can go to and say \u2018We don\u2019t want that video released to the public.\u2019\u201d\nWhat if the officer takes the phone?\nThe Sidekik app can also be configured to require a pin from both the user and the attorney to stop the phone from recording and streaming data once it has started.\nEven if the officer takes and destroys the phone, Sidekik believes enough evidence would be gathered and stored in the cloud to show the nature of the encounter in court.\nStage of development\nThe first phase of funding ended late last year, enabling the development of the graphic user interface of the app, as well as feasibility studies and a blueprint of the full development of the complex software app.\nPhase two, which would be funding the full development of the app, began earlier this month, and a variety of perks are available for crowdfunding supporters at Indiegogo. Those who contribute with bitcoin receive the same rewards for a contribution of 10 percent less.\nTo develop the app, Sidekik is working with Zco, one of the largest app development companies in the world.", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 31}

If you are an AICPA member, the webcast is available for your viewing. In this article, the key points from that presentation are outlined and will help accountants fundamentally understand and approach business based Bitcoin transactions.\nBitcoin and General Ledger Treatment\nThere are three key processes that ultimately produce different accounting practices and general ledger treatment when Bitcoin is involved. These three processes coincide with Bitcoin\u2019s adoption phases as follows:\nPayment MethodForeign CurrencyBase Currency\nBitcoin as a type of \u201cPayment Method\u201d\nWithin the context of modern accounting systems, examples of payment methods include cash, checks and credit cards. Very simply, they define the medium used to exchange money.\nToday, the most common business use for Bitcoin is to treat it as a payment method. Much of the reason for this is because a) the price is relatively volatile and b) acceptance by employees, suppliers and partners is relatively limited. Services such as BitPay or Coinbase have effectively made it easy to accept bitcoin in a business. Instead of the business actually receiving bitcoin during customer payment, these services deliver traditional government-issued (fiat) currency.\nUnder this method, Bitcoin acceptance is easy to understand and it follows accounting practices widely used in business today (e.g., consider payment by services such as PayPal). Traditional accounting systems should have no problem under this practice. Generally, define a new payment method in the accounting software, relate it to the bank account that the funds will settle, and then follow the procedures that the Bitcoin service provider prescribes for accepting bitcoin in the business.\nBitcoin as a type of \u201cForeign Currency\u201d\nThe next adoption wave will happen if bitcoin price volatility stabilizes and it becomes more widely accepted. Some leading-edge businesses already work in this fashion. Under this method of accounting, bitcoin is treated as a foreign currency; just as one would treat accepting Euros in a USD-based organization. To do this well, the business accounting system will need to understand foreign currency and related exchange prices. Traditional accounting platforms are designed with \u201ccurrency data types\u201d to accommodate only two decimal places. I was one of the early advocates to logically shift the bitcoin decimal place to the right by six digits and base bitcoin in micro bitcoin (\u00b5Bitcoin) thus allowing it to work in common general ledger accounting systems.\nNot all accounting systems allow for new foreign currency definitions \u2014 hence, if the business software is designed only for local currency, this method of accounting will not work. In addition, some accounting systems \u201chard code\u201d their foreign currency references, and accountants may find this to be a limitation in their client or internal systems.\nUnder foreign currency accounting, a business bases its transactions in a local currency but may denominate transactions and/or accept foreign currency to conduct business. This practice is well understood in larger organizations \u2014 especially ones that transact in international trade.\nUnder this method of accounting, without respect for local tax regulations that demand different regulatory reporting requirements, bitcoin transactions effectively trigger both realized and unrealized gains and losses based on changing market currency exchange rates and timing differences between when transaction obligations are recognized and ultimately settled.\nFinally, when bitcoin is treated as a foreign currency, the accounting software will price every single transaction relative to the base currency. With this price information in hand, a tax accountant can reconstitute the records offline to meet regulatory reporting requirements; such as the recent IRS guidelines that demands that bitcoin be treated as a property.\nBitcoin as a type of \u201cBase Currency\u201d\nIn the final adoption wave, while it may be far off, it is conceivable to see businesses deem bitcoin as the base currency and thus treat all other currencies as foreign \u2014 even the home currency. While this is simply an enhancement of the Foreign Currency treatment previously discussed, this method may be valuable for organizations that are fundamentally global and trade with customers, employees, suppliers and partners anywhere and everywhere. While, this accounting treatment will produce a different orientation and obviously introduces interesting reporting questions, if many organizations elect this method, it does represent a way to measure whether bitcoin has indeed achieved wide global acceptance.\nIs Bitcoin integrated with the General Ledger today?\nCompanies that run NetSuite are set up to transact globally and with BTC4ERP, they have the full range of options to configure their accounting practices based on the way they see bitcoin used in their business. I witness some companies who simply seek a bitcoin price feed into their accounting system to help them with their own manual methods of accounting. Others indeed treat Bitcoin transactions as foreign currency and rely on the automatic bookkeeping and transaction coordination provided by my service. If bitcoin gains wider acceptance, I suspect we will see these accounting treatments on a wider range of accounting systems.", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 31}

During the challenge, more than 500 venture capitalists, banking professionals and financial technology experts will judge the contestants on how much their business could impact the world.\n\u201cWe are delighted that Wells Fargo, Luxembourg for Finance, Level39, Invest Northern Ireland and HP have confirmed their support for 2015. I\u2019m confident our collaboration will help us further advance innovation in financial services and also benefit the startups participating in this year\u2019s startup challenge program,\u201d said Fabian Vandenreydt, head of markets management at Innotribe and the SWIFT Institute.\nInterest in Digital Currencies\nLast year\u2019s winner was a payment solution for banks based on the bitcoin blockchain, called Epiphyte. According to Epiphyte\u2019s former director of research, Jo Lang, Innotribe helped open doors, gave them legitimacy and, most importantly, access to the private SWIFT payment network.\n\u201cAt Innotribe, a lot of discussion revolved around cryptocurrency and whether it\u2019s a currency or a system,\u201d wrote Lang.\nOut of the 60 startups chosen to be semi-finalists in this year\u2019s challenge, about one sixth of them are digital currency companies. The digital currency companies that made the cut included Asian bitcoin exchange BitSpark, cryptocurrency debit card Shift Pay, bitcoin remittance company Xendit and decentralized digital asset ledger Hyper.\nUnlike previous years, 2015 semi-finalists have been cut up into geographical regions, consisting of Asia, Africa, Europe and North America. Each region will have its own showcase, where 15 startups belonging to the region will pitch their startups to judges. The final 20 contestants, five from each region, will pitch their startups at the Innotribe Startup Challenge Grand Finale, which will be held on October 14, 2015 at Sibos in Singapore.\nBeyond the opportunity to pitch investors and financial institutions, the winner of the challenge will get access to the SWIFT payment network and a $50,000 prize.\nTough Competition\n\u201cEvery year the bar gets higher, with many impressive applications from startups coming from across the globe. It is great to see this community using Innotribe as a platform of choice, and allows us to provide them with even greater opportunities to connect with the financial industry,\u201d said Vandenreydt.\nOne of this year\u2019s non-bitcoin competitors is the Chile-headquartered remittance company, Crowdtransfer, which will take place in the North American region. Like TransferWise, it delivers remittances without sending money over borders. Instead, it uses internal sources to send money to the desired recipients. But it connects people directly, making it the first P2P remittance service provider.\nAnother unique company in the running is South Africa-based YueDiligence, a self-assessment valuation tool for entrepreneurs to access funding readiness and to help analyze deal flow.\n\u201cWe are eager to see what the 2015 applicants have to offer, and look forward to giving them that much-needed exposure to financial institutions,\u201d said Vandenreydt.\n\nHackathon image via TechCrunch / CC BY 2.0", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 31}

I don\u2019t have a good answer; and it sounds like I\u2019m trying to be evasive about whether the Canadian government should regulate.\n\u201cThat being said, we think that cryptotechnology is a very exciting area and one that we\u2019re currently doing research on and are engaged with many of the large providers in this space trying to understand it better, and maybe even doing some testing around it,\u201d he said.\nAt the moment, the foundation is concerned about the anonymity of Bitcoin making it more risky for the unbanked instead of these people becoming a known quantity. This case wasn\u2019t clearly made, so the senators seemed a little puzzled.\nBut the Canadian senators did understand the foundation\u2019s problem with the \u201cvolatility\u201d of digital currencies.\nThe senators said they also were glad to be told that the Gates Foundation is interested in their work as they go into the report-writing stage of the hearings into digital currencies.\nThe final report release date has not been set, but Bitcoin Magazine will be covering the report when it is released.

And a newer,slightly improved version being slated for the release of the Samsung Galaxy 6 beginning in April.\nVirtual reality is not just about games anymore. By some accounts, the hottest ticket at last month\u2019s annual Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah was to the Oculus Virtual World Simulator demonstration.\nSome are convinced it is the future of filmmaking. Several Hollywood studios are actively exploring and creating content for virtual reality. It is estimated that 170 million users will own virtual reality hardware within the next three years.\nDigital currencies and blockchain technology are frequently referred to as a paradigm shift, and the virtual world may become dependent on the blockchain.\nShows such as Cirque du Soleil have captured a portion of a live performance in VR, placing the viewer on-stage during in the three-dimensional experience. Live rock concerts and sporting events are likely to follow soon.\nA Paul McCartney concert in virtual reality is now available from the Google Play store for those using the Google Cardboard virtual reality home-kit. Last year, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would acquire Oculus for $2 billion, with plans to connect their 2 billion users with this entirely new platform.\nThe tech world is now putting the possibilities into imagination.\nWhat does this have to do with Bitcoin?\nA blockchain might be necessary to bind a real-world person with a virtual-world persona. Facebook and other social media sites are struggling to prevent ISIS terrorists from recruiting on their sites. The terrorist recruiters have learned tricks from Internet trolls\u2019 methods to easily create new identities each time they are banned.\nThe blockchain invention might prove invaluable when a company needs to tie a virtual persona to a real person through a technique known as proof of existence. This could be used to create an identifying hash tied to a retinal scan or other biometric data that is unique for each real person using VR equipment in real time.\nA possible result would be an identifying hash stored permanently on the blockchain that would represent you over a multitude of experiences. This one single identifier tag might defeat identity fraud or act as one of the component signatures in a multi-sig wallet.\nIt is portable and can be used by a multitude of companies and systems creating content throughout the world. A negative aspect is that it could be possible to ban one\u2019s identifier address tag, which might send one into a sort of VR purgatory. In the future, just the threat of having your online identity tag banned might be a de-facto method of control.\nWhere is this headed?\nIn 2011, author Ernest Cline wrote a futuristic novel Ready Player One. Steven Spielberg has agreed to direct the big-budget epic for Warner Brothers Studios. The studio won the bidding rights to the movie before the book was finished and has spent years trying to find a way to bring the futuristic story to life on the big screen.\nHollywood studios have been increasingly transfixed by the ideas and possibilities explored for the world of virtual reality explored in the story. Ready Player One was so influential that it was cited by Oculus\u2019 then 19-year-old founder Palmer Luckey as one of the primary reasons he started the company.\nThe author himself admitted he might have underestimated where the technology will be 30 years in the future when the story unfolds. Because of the respect and example his work has provided for the thousands of people working on the technology and the tens of thousands of content creators soon to follow, it might considered the benchmark to measure our place in the technology roadmap.\nIn Ready Player One, the lines between the real world and the virtual world become fuzzy. The concept of earning monetary \u201ccredits\u201d for income and spending between the two realities mix seamlessly. The human desire to share experiences will quickly lead to interconnection of the hardware so that one need not feel alone in the experience. It might not take long before \u201creal\u201d human representatives could act as their own avatars and become real-time tour guides.\nAs the technology improves, entire careers might happen inside a shared virtual world experience. In this world there are no borders. Countries and concepts such as national currencies might seem as antiquated as paying for things with sea shells.\nAs our children take virtual tours walking among the dinosaurs as part of a school project, they might view our current concept of money and think we must have lived at the time of the dinosaurs ourselves. One might ask if it possible that currencies restricted by borders that only exist in the physical world might just become \u2026 irrelevant?\nHow close are we to virtual reality?\nMany of the industry watchers consider the Gear VR product the first mainstream virtual device laying down the gauntlet for many to follow. This technology could bring the ability for the disabled to do the things impossible in the real world. Seeing, touching and experiencing places one could never afford to travel seem to be just around the corner. Those gateways and portals will cost money, however. So whose national currency would you use for this travel?\nAlready, live 3D feeds can be experienced that give a sense of \u201cpresence\u201d never experienced before. Users have to remind themselves their physical existence is in a place and time they aren\u2019t seeing.\nThere are still a couple of drawbacks. Some people experience \u201csimulator sickness,\u201d although this problem is been dramatically reduced with new understanding and technology. And the pixel count isn\u2019t quite high enough (at least in the 720p resolution) for a perfectly clear picture when magnified with goggles.\nAt the 2015 Gamers Development Conference in March, HTC reportedly stole the show with Vive, a unit more advanced than the Oculus products personal computer-connected devices. It is expected to be in consumer hands before Christmas.\nSony is working on its own virtual reality product called \u201cProject Morpheus\u201d for PlayStation 4. There are rumors of other companies also in the space, though no official announcements have been made.\nYouTube already has joined several other companies offering 360-degree full immersion videos. The conversion is happening at breakneck pace. The center of the three converging technologies is once again the high-tech investor Mark Andreesen. The creator of the first web browser is now a top venture capitalist with board membership on Facebook, and a lead investor in both Oculus and the world\u2019s biggest U.S.-based Bitcoin exchange and wallet service Coinbase.\nIn a world where it\u2019s becoming more difficult and complex to believe what you see, it might pay to keep an eye on Andreesen to see what\u2019s coming next. His predictions in both of these new emerging technologies might be destined to meet.\nImage Sergey Galyonkin from Kyiv, Ukraine \u2013 Orlovsky and Oculus Rift Uploaded by Yakiv Gluck / CC BY SA 2.0", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 1}

In the early days of mobile phones, only a few enthusiasts dared to imagine that camera-equipped phones could ever threaten established camera manufacturers, but Kodak was forced to declare bankruptcy only a few years later, in 2012.Tillier\u2019s answer is that yes, Bitcoin could seriously hurt the banking system. The reason is very simple:\u201cBanks are so used to taking a cut every time money changes hands that they cannot imagine life without that particular revenue stream.\n\u201dTransaction fees are only a small part of banks\u2019 revenue, and therefore banks could survive without that particular revenue stream. But they would be seriously annoyed:\u201c[Transaction revenue] is some of the only money that banks make that has zero associated risk and very little associated cost,\u201d notes Tillier. \u201cThere is no risk, and hardly any cost, in charging you $30 to receive a wire transfer, especially when the bank takes three days of interest on that money by delaying payment to you. If that revenue is removed or even seriously reduced, it will have to be replaced, meaning that a higher proportion of bank revenue will be coming from increasingly risky loans or trading.\n\u201dThe unique advantage of the blockchain technology behind Bitcoin is that it permits faster, cheaper, and transparent transactions. Every bitcoin transaction is permanently recorded in the tamper-proof public blockchain, which is maintained by Bitcoin users at zero cost to the banks. The fact that we can transfer bitcoin instantly (in a few seconds, or a few minutes waiting for the transaction to be confirmed by the network) to the other side of the planet, at a very low cost, shows that traditional banking fees are obsolete legacy practices that must be abandoned. Innovative Bitcoin \u201cbanks\u201d such as Circle (which is not technically a bank, but plays an equivalent role for its clients) are doing just that, and beginning to offer cheap and fast money transfers.\u201c[Bitcoin] may well be a threat to the easy money that banks currently take from you and me, but that doesn\u2019t pose an existential threat to the system,\u201d concludes Tillier. \u201cThe banks\u2019 reaction to a reduction in that easy money, on the other hand, could be a different story.\n\u201dOf course, the banks won\u2019t give up their easy money without a fight. Barclays\u2019 CEO Antony Jenkins recently discussed the growing concern among financial institutions that faster, cheaper payment systems will start to seduce their consumer and business customers in the coming years.In a recent report titled \u201cDigital Disruption \u2013 UK Banking Report,\u201d the British Banking Association argues that Bitcoin is a threat to the banking industry.\n\u201cAs digital and cryptocurrencies gain traction, the threat to banks' free-income streams will grow,\u201d notes the report. \u201cBanks must invest time and energy in understanding how best to use the technology behind principles like bitcoin, before other players step in to make that decision for them.\u201dOf course, banks can (and do) also lobby to make digital cryptocurrency illegal, but the United Kingdom and other governments recently have expressed open-minded positions in the interest of common good. Meanwhile, forward-looking banks such as German Fidor Bank are integrating Bitcoin with their consumer banking operations.\nThe term \u201cthreats\u201d frequently occurs in official reports related to the emerging digital economy. In a recent discussion paper, the Australian government mentions bitcoin and digital currencies as potential threats to tax collection.\n\u201cNew ways of transacting, including cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, were not contemplated when the current tax system was designed,\u201d notes the report. \u201cThese developments make determining the appropriate tax outcome for a particular company in a specific country difficult and raise concerns about the ability of companies to relocate profits to minimize their tax.\n\u201dOther governments are less scared of Bitcoin as a threat to taxation, probably because they are confident in their ability to de-anonymize bitcoin transactions and trace them back to their originators. In the United States, there have been proposals to gradually introduce tax payments in Bitcoin, which would constitute a quite radical shift from early libertarian perceptions of Bitcoin as a financial privacy tool.\nPhoto via\u00a0stantontcady\u00a0/ CC BY-ND 2.0", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 1}

Based on the applications under development by the more than 7,000 developers using the\u00a0Coinbase API, it appears that four main categories of Bitcoin applications are gaining popularity among developers: P2P tipping, cross-border payments, international microfinance and reputation platforms.\nThe Coinbase post identifies other promising Bitcoin application categories and business models that haven\u2019t been targeted by many developers so far, and recommends to Bitcoin developers and startups: \u201cHere\u2019s 10 ideas for Bitcoin startups that we would love to see more developers working on.\u201d\nCoinbase recommends developing innovative email and online content services based on bitcoin micropayments. We are used to a \u201cfree\u201d Internet where nobody has to pay, but, of course, there is no such thing as a free lunch. The price that we pay for free email is spam, and the price that we pay for free content is rampant advertising \u2013 often annoying, intrusive, and ugly \u2013 and disclosure of browsing habits to marketers. Paid models based on bitcoin micropayments could change that.\nFor example, email could be a pay-as-you-go service, with a small fee (say 0.1 cents) to send a message. That wouldn\u2019t be too much of an annoyance for normal email users, while at the same time it would impose prohibitive costs to bulk email campaign and mass spamming. Similarly, web ads could be replaced by micropayments for viewing articles and videos. For example, an article or a video could be unlocked for one hour when a dedicated Bitcoin address receives a micropayment.\nMicropayments are impossible to implement with traditional payment systems, because the overhead costs (transaction fees) would be too high. But the fast micropayments with low transaction fees, permitted by Bitcoin, allow the switch to alternative models for paid online content.\nThat would also permit creators, such as artists, fiction writers and filmmakers, to make a living with their work.\nCoinbase also recommends developing applications that incentivize nodes to provide resources to communications networks, such as the Tor network or the Bitcoin blockchain itself, by rewarding participating nodes with micropayments.\nInternet pioneers such as Ted Nelson, Marc Andreessen and Tim Berners-Lee thought that the Internet should have a built-in framework for micropayments. Berners-Lee tried to include micropayments in Web protocols, but the idea was never implemented.\n\u201cThe Innovators: How a Group of Inventors, Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution,\u201d a 2014 book by Walter Isaacson, has the full story:\n\u201cIn the late 1990s Berners-Lee tried to develop a micropayments system for the Web through the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which he headed. The idea was to devise a way to embed in a Web page the information needed to handle a small payment, which would allow different \u2018electronic wallet\u2019 services to be created by banks or entrepreneurs. It was never implemented, partly because of the changing complexity of banking regulations.\u201d\nBerners-Lee revived the effort to develop an official W3C micropayments framework in 2013. The work hasn\u2019t been completed so far, but Bitcoin is a good solution, because sending a micropayment with Bitcoin can be as easy and immediate as clicking a button.\nIsaacson reports that Andreessen mentioned Bitcoin as a good model for standard Internet payment systems. \u201cIf I had a time machine and could go back to 1993, one thing I\u2019d do for sure would be to build in Bitcoin or some similar form of cryptocurrency,\u201d Andreessen said.", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 2}

And Gem, a developer API platform that does just that, announced today it is opening up its service to everyone.\n\u201cBitcoin is new technology, and let\u2019s be honest, a lot of the essentials required to use it are rough to figure out and can take a lot of manpower,\u201d said Gem COO, Ken Miller, in a statement. \u201cThere are enough adoption hurdles already without developers actually being incentivized not to integrate Bitcoin. So we decided to do something about that.\u201d\nThe API allows for unlimited transactions, 2-of-3 multi-signature security, Hardware Security module (HSM) cosigning protection, and numerous other features. And these, among other features, are ones that beta users have been relying on to build out formerly-complex functionality.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a really incredibly diverse set of applications using our system \u2013 from some obvious suspects such as exchanges, marketplaces and payment processing \u2014 to some really fantastic applications working on things such as micropayments, payroll and BTM machines,\u201d said Miller in an interview withBitcoin Magazine.\nThe reality for Bitcoin is that many developers would rather spend their time creating a magical user interface or an innovative use case rather than working on low-level cryptography and security. By enabling this functionality with an API, Gem hopes to reduce the time and effort necessary to create a secure Bitcoin integration. This would enable developers working on projects in other sectors such as banking and finance, identity management, and the Internet of Things to integrate blockchain capabilities easily.\nMiller gave a use case where a company developing IoT technology could utilize Gem\u2019s API.\n\u201cAn interesting one could be medicine,\u201d Miller said, \u201cwhere you could envision wearable medical devices where multiple keys (or confirmations) are required to approve medicine prescription/administration, release of records, etc.\u201d\nBecause the blockchain is secure, it could require both the doctor and the patient to give permission before the records could be sent to another source. Or perhaps it requires both parents to give permission for their child\u2019s records to be sent. Gem\u2019s API could handle that.\n\u201cMany developers are eager to incorporate Bitcoin into their products and services, but aren\u2019t sure where to start, or are lacking resources to figure it out. It feels really good to say we\u2019ve solved that problem,\u201d said Micah Winkelspecht, Gem CEO and founder.\nGem Raises Additional Funding\nAlong with the news that Gem was opening their API to the public, the company also announced that it has raised an additional $1.3 million, which brings its total financing to $3.3 million. KEC Ventures was the lead investor, with First Round Capital, RRE Ventures, ECEG Partners, Birchmere Labs, Baroda Ventures, Amplify.LA, Tekton Ventures, Drummond Road Capital and Robert Wolfson all participating in the round.\n\u201cThe growth of Gem\u2019s platform in recent months has been really impressive. It\u2019s great to see the impact of taking something as complicated as working with Bitcoin, and making it accessible to developers who might otherwise be turned off,\u201d said Jeffrey Citron, Managing Partner at KEC Ventures, in a statement.\nThe company intends to use the money to increase the development of new features and also scale its services.\nFrom PayPal to Bitcoin\nFounder and COO Miller got his start with PayPal early on as its 22ndemployee. In an interview withBitcoin Magazine, Miller explained that Bitcoin seemed like a natural fit based on what he viewed was PayPal\u2019s contribution to the Internet.\n\u201cI was one of the first employees at PayPal and experienced the power of building something durable that had a permanent impact on how online commerce occurs,\u201d he said. He was part of the anti-fraud and risks systems that PayPal was incorporating, which Miller admits is an issue for Bitcoin.\n\u201cIn late 2013 I started to dig into Bitcoin in a research capacity and quickly realized the protocol itself was maybe the most important invention we\u2019ve seen after the Internet and mobile,\u201d he said. And if it was going to have a permanent, lasting impact on society, \u201cI wanted to get involved.\u201d\nNow that he\u2019s entrenched with Bitcoin, his excitement continues to grow. When asked what excites him most about Bitcoin, his answer speaks to the technological innovation.\n\u201cMaybe not a conventional answer, but honestly, I\u2019m most excited about its resiliency. Given the price volatility over the last several months, Bitcoin has been a bit of a punching bag during that period. It\u2019s funny to think what might have happened to the Internet back in the late \u201990s if there had been a daily fluctuating price attached to it, but fortunately that was not the case. But even with the price volatility associated with speculative bitcoin trading, the reality is there is the protocol behind it is so powerful and permanent that it cannot be uninvented and is obviously persevering through currency fluctuations and doomsday messages.\u201d\nThe world has experienced Bitcoin. Whether the traditional financial sector is happy about it or not, it\u2019s here to stay. And Gem hopes that by releasing its APIs to the general public, more products, applications and services will be built on it.", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 2}

Airtime purchases made from Celery\u2019s exchange take the money straight from the person\u2019s bank account, similar to the process of buying bitcoin.\nIn addition, Bitrefill is eliminating fees for airtime remittances to India. The U.S.-India corridor contributes largely to the $70 billion worth of remittances that flow into the Asian country each year.\nA Proven Model\nIsmail Ahmed, founder and CEO of WorldRemit, told Mobile World Live in 2014, that informal airtime remittances could make nearly half of the $40 billion worth of remittances that flow into Africa each year.\nAhmed made that comment shortly after raising $40 million from Accel Partners and others in a Series A Round, so his money transfer company could pursue airtime and other remittance services.\nAirtime remittances are particularly valuable for people sending amounts of money worth under $20. According to TransferTo\u2018s CEO Eric Barbier, that\u2019s the \u201csweet spot\u201d for the unconventional money transfer. Remittance companies charge too much to make remittances of such a small amount possible, but airtime services\u2019 low fees make it a viable option.\nIn many parts of the world, airtime minutes are not only serving as an informal money transfer system, but also as actual money. According to the Economist, in places such as Haiti, Zimbabwe and Egypt, airtime minutes are used to buy things such as gasoline, water and electricity.\nAccording to Hannes Van Rensburg, Visa\u2019s head of their sub-Saharan Africa division, airtime as money is particularly popular in countries where rigid regulatory schemes have made it very difficult for banks to offer new kinds of electronic money.\nEven places such as Kenya, where mobile money such as M-Pesa is extremely popular, airtime as money has found a use case. Airtime minutes\u2019 relatively stable price serves as a better store of value than the Kenyan shilling, causing people to hold airtime minutes rather than shillings.\nBitcoin\u2019s UX Problem\nA lot has been said about how non-user-friendly bitcoin can be, but according to Bitrefill CEO and co-founder, Sergej Kotliar, it\u2019s really bad. During an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Kotliar said users in many countries remain confused how to use bitcoin when paying for Bitrefill\u2019s service.\n\u201cThey had to be walked, step by step, through the process,\u201d he said.\nThe partnership with Celery will allow users to take advantage of Bitrefill\u2019s cheaper rates and convenience, while never having to touch the rather confusing digital currency.\nAfter signing in, Celery users will see a \u201cPhone Refill\u201d feature toward the bottom of the screen. The user then chooses the amount he or she wants and clicks \u201cPurchase.\u201d The same amount is deducted from the customer\u2019s bank account by Celery, which sends the order for airtime minutes to Bitrefill. The recipient receives the airtime a few seconds later.\nBut overcoming Bitcoin\u2019s UX problem is just one of the steps the company is taking to reach its grander goal.\n\u201cWe want to connect the worlds of prepaid and bitcoin. For bitcoin to be used by developing countries, they need to be able to spend it,\u201d said Kotliar. \u201cYou can\u2019t exchange bitcoin easily in the developing world, but you can spend airtime easily.\u201d\nFull-Fledged Startup\n\u201cAs Westerners, we didn\u2019t realize how much of the world used prepaid phones. It\u2019s actually the way the majority of the world receives their phone minutes and data,\u201d said Kotliar.\nBitrefill launched in October as a side product for its two co-founders, Kotliar and Aleksandra Derikonja. But a month after launching the service, the company received a lot of interest from the press and, subsequently, from users.\nThat provoked Kotliar and Derikonja to think more deeply about the prospects of bitcoin in the prepaid airtime industry. After researching the industry more, they discovered that a bitcoin-powered airtime service could solve issues of convenience, price and more.\nBitrefill is headquartered in San Mateo, California, as part of the Bitcoin startup accelerator program Boost VC.

It signed a partnership with Spondoolies Tech, a provider of mining hardware, to acquire a significant amount of mining equipment. Spondoolies became a shareholder at about 10 cents a share and in exchange, BTCS was able to ramp up its mining operations from 176 Th/s (tera hashes per second) to 891 Th/s.\nAllen said that if the effort works, the company is ready to quickly scale from there.\nIt signed a lease in a repurposed manufacturing building with 83,000 square feet. The first year rent is $58,271, and if the operation goes according to plan, BTCS has the option to buy the facility outright in the second year.\nAllen feels this is the perfect time to get into bitcoin mining because the price has dropped enough that everyone else is starting to leave.\n\u201cThe mistake everyone made was that they didn\u2019t care about cost structure,\u201d Allen said.\nIn other words, everyone kept thinking about how the price could go to the moon, so they didn\u2019t try to get the cheapest electricity or the best hardware. Allen explained that there were miners who were paying 10 cents per kilowatt hour.\n\u201cYou need to be under 6 cents per kWh. If you\u2019re in the 3-4 cent range, you\u2019re doing good,\u201d Allen said.\nOperation Hedge Strategy\nBTCS intends to succeed with a mechanism it calls Operation Hedge. Allen believes it will be one of the cheapest \u2014 if not the cheapest \u2014 miners on the market. That means that it can tolerate bitcoin price drops more than other miners.\nAllen is banking on smaller and more inefficient miners to go offline as the price drops, which will cause the network hash rate to drop and the difficulty with it. If that happens, BTCS\u2019 overall operation will account for more of the total hash rate, which will result in more bitcoin mined per month.\n\u201cBecause we were able to get the lead manufacturer [Spondoolies] to take equity, we are in a good position,\u201d Allen said.\nBetween the decreased cost of hardware because the life of mining hardware increases when the difficulty drops, the decreased costs to run the mining operation, and the increased number of bitcoin mined, BTCS expects to find success in its mining operation.\nIt\u2019s About the Ecosystem\nBTCS isn\u2019t just looking at mining, though it is the way to generate revenue fastest with Bitcoin. The company is expanding into the entire sector, trying to become a universal Bitcoin ecosystem.\nIt has made strategic partnerships with GoCoin, Gem, Expresscoin, and Coin Outlet, which will allow it to spread out into multiple parts of the total network.\nIn particular, Allen feels that remittance is the way that businesses can generate revenue longer term. If mining is 1-2 years, remittance is likely 3-5.\n\u201cThe best way for remittance to work is to set up ATMs,\u201d Allen explained. \u201cYou have one in the target country as well as the originating country, and users can go in and out of bitcoin.\u201d\nIts partnership with Coin Outlet will allow it to quickly grow out the ATM business across the world.\nMining As a Business\nBTCS is in a position to get into the mining business at an attractive price point. And as it scales, Allen explained that its power costs will decrease for each kilowatt hour because it will be able to negotiate based on its buying power.\nIn the United States, Washington State is the best place to mine and then, Allen said, North Carolina, which is where BTCS has its operation. The electricity is cheap enough, and with its Spondoolies hardware, it is in a good position to take a significant amount of market share.\n\nPhoto by Beraldo Leal /CC BY 2.0", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 25}

The government will formally consult on the proposed regulatory approach early in the next Parliament.The government will work with BSI (British Standards Institution) and the digital currency industry to develop voluntary standards for consumer protection.The government is launching a new research initiative that will bring together the Research Councils, Alan Turing Institute and Digital Catapult with industry in order to address the research opportunities and challenges for digital currency technology, and will increase research funding in this area by \u00a310 million (U.S. $14.6 million) to support this.\nThe Digital Catapult is a national center whose mission is to rapidly accelerate the United Kingdom\u2019s best digital ideas to market to create new products, services, jobs and value for the U.K. economy. Their focus is on data and metadata \u2013 on the data value chain.\nThe Alan Turing Institute will promote the development and use of advanced mathematics, computer science, algorithms and big data for human benefit. The Institute will encompass a wide range of scientific disciplines and be relevant to a wide range of business sectors.\nAllocating the grant to these organizations indicates that the U.K. government is interested in supporting and understanding the underlying technology \u2013 the blockchain \u2013 and understands the potential benefits it could bring to society.\nThe first two points indicate that, similar to progressive jurisdictions such as the Isle of Man, the U.K. government intends to offer a friendly and agile regulatory environment to digital fintech firms while providing strong consumer protection and strictly applying money-laundering regulations. This approach, agile but firm, suggests that cryptocurrencies are poised to be integrated with the regulated framework of mainstream fintech.\nThe Treasury document recognizes that, in addition to reducing the costs involved in moving money around the economy, digital currencies can speed up transaction processing times, the cost and time advantages of digital currencies being most notable in the context of cross-border transactions.\nWhile digital currencies offer greater privacy in some respects, they also create greater transparency, because all transactions are published on the public blockchain. This consideration shows that, similar to other governments, the United Kingdom is now persuaded that digital fintech based on cryptocurrencies can provide more \u2013 not less \u2013 transparency and control.\nElliptic, a secure Bitcoin vault based in London, stated that the U.K. government action plan represents encouraging progress in several key areas: anti-money laundering (AML), consumer protection and technical standardization.\n\u201cPrioritizing AML will bring much-needed legitimacy and clarity to the industry and hopefully encourage banks to engage more with digital currency businesses,\u201d reads Elliptic\u2019s statement.\n\u201cFurthermore, allowing the industry to develop its own consumer protection and technical standards will promote collaboration and innovation much more efficiently than top-down regulation. This response is important for cryptocurrency companies in the U.K. because it demonstrates a pragmatic, collaborative and priority-driven approach to regulation,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThe Treasury\u2019s willingness to work alongside entrepreneurs to promote financial innovation while working tirelessly to protect consumers is a main reason the U.K. holds its place at the forefront of fintech innovation globally.\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 19}

The integration with Bitnet\u2019s platform will make Rakuten one of the largest e-commerce companies in the world to accept bitcoin payments.\n\u201cRakuten\u2019s mission is to empower the world through the Internet,\u201d said Yaz Iida, President of Rakuten USA. \u201cNot only can bitcoin support this vision by helping our merchants better compete globally, but it also has the potential to benefit society by enhancing the security, privacy and convenience of financial transactions. This is one of the reasons why we invested in Bitnet last year and we look forward to working with them on our U.S. marketplace.\u201d\nRakuten, a Japanese e-commerce company founded in 1997 by current CEO Hiroshi Mikitani, operates the largest e-commerce site in Japan and one of the world\u2019s largest by sales, immediately behind Amazon, eBay and Alibaba. The company provides a variety of products and services for consumers and businesses, with a focus on e-commerce, finance and digital content.\nSince 2012, Rakuten has been ranked among the world\u2019s \u201cTop 20 Most Innovative Companies\u201d in Forbes magazine\u2019s annual list. Rakuten is expanding worldwide and currently operates throughout Asia, Europe, the Americas and Oceania.\nRakuten sells basically everything online \u2013 electronics, computers, fashion and beauty products, books, movies, music, household items, toys, health products, etc. \u2013 so the Rakuten online shop can provide a one-stop destination for all needs besides food and rent. That will facilitate the global adoption of bitcoin as an Internet currency that can be used to pay for all sorts of useful things online.\nRakuten has been open and passionate about bitcoin\u2019s potential use, hosting several panel talks dedicated to the subject at a recent financial conference hosted by the company, The Wall Street Journal reports.\nBitcoin payments will be launched first in the United States, Germany and Austria, but Rakuten\u2019s biggest sales are in the Japanese e-commerce site, which isn\u2019t open to bitcoin yet. Mikitani said last month that he plans to roll out the bitcoin function to the Japanese market as well, but didn\u2019t specify a target date.\nIn October, Rakuten participated in a $14.5 million Series A funding round for Bitcoin payment processor Bitnet, led by Highland Capital Partners. TechCrunch notes that, with this development, Rakuten is putting its investment in Bitnet to work. This news is notable because it not only continues the trend toward bitcoin acceptance among retailers, but it could help position Bitnet as a credible alternative to leading bitcoin payment processors Coinbase and BitPay.\nAnother possible and important consequence of this development is that it could stimulate the adoption of bitcoin payments by the three global e-commerce operators bigger than Rakuten: Amazon, eBay, and Alibaba. EBay is considering taking bitcoin payments, and its subsidiary PayPal, the main online payments provider accepted by all e-commerce sites, is taking steps toward accepting bitcoin payments.\n\nImage of Yaz Iida via LinkedIn.", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 17}

Facebook Messenger payments will roll out first in the United States over the coming months.\n\u201cWe use secure systems that encrypt the connection between you and Facebook as well as your card information when you ask us to store it for you,\u201d says the Facebook announcement. \u201cWe use layers of software and hardware protection that meet the highest industry standards. These payment systems are kept in a secured environment that is separate from other parts of the Facebook network and that receive additional monitoring and control. A team of anti-fraud specialists monitor for suspicious purchase activity to help keep accounts safe.\u201d\nFacebook doesn\u2019t charge payment fees because it doesn\u2019t have to monetize payments. For Facebook, it\u2019s enough to keep users locked in the hugely popular Messenger app instead of switching to a dedicated payment service such as PayPal or Google Wallet to send money to friends.\nMessenger is one of the largest platforms in the world, with more than 500 million monthly users. And last year Facebook spent nearly $22 billion to buy WhatsApp, a separate messaging platform that now counts more than 700 million active users globally.\nThe new integrated payment features, which are fast, easy to use and secured by solid technology and operating practices, could make digital friend-to-friend payments and micropayments commonplace.\n\u201c[C]onversations about money are already happening on Messenger,\u201d as people chat about bar tabs, splitting dinner bills, and sharing the cost of an Uber, Facebook\u2019s product manager Steve Davis told TechCrunch. \u201cWhat we want to do is make it easy to finish the conversation in the same place you started. You don\u2019t have to switch to another app.\u201d\nGiven Facebook\u2019s huge size and reach, the introduction of its payments feature is likely to disrupt the emerging market for instant P2P payments, notes The New York Times. And analysts said that if the payment system succeeded, Facebook would extend it to other types of purchases, such as consumers\u2019 buying of products directly from advertisers.\nWith this announcement, the social networking giant seems to be claiming a place among the large companies that, according to the MIT Technology Review report, will be the big winners in the digital fintech arena.\nThe Facebook announcement doesn\u2019t mention Bitcoin. But it would be technically easy to add a Bitcoin wallet besides a credit card, and send bitcoin payments to the wallet of the recipient. That leaves open the option for Facebook to integrate bitcoin payments.\nBlogger Jimmy Song suspects that bitcoin payments may indeed be part of Facebook\u2019s long-term plan. He notes that David Marcus, the former PayPal president who now runs Facebook\u2019s Messenger division, has been a fan of bitcoin for a long time.", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 18}

Rewards for running full nodes are being paid in bitcoin.\nA Bitcoin node is a part of the network that allows Bitcoin to operate the way it does. It increases security and improves reliability by validating transactions and blocks and then relaying that information to other full nodes.\nAny individual can run a full node by using the Core client (Bitcoin Core).\nMiners, the ledger clerks of the Bitcoin sector, are incentivized by rewarding them for solving blocks. These blocks contain information about recent transactions and the reward (at the moment) is 25 bitcoin, which can be spread among those contributing toward the mining.\nBut there are no similar incentives for individuals or businesses running full nodes. They have only the gratification that they are supporting the network. And if they are not mining, others are being rewarded for it. This is a problem, as nodes are arguably as important as mining.\nAnother problem: Keeping a full node running for an extensive period entails cost. The hardware being used may be out of play for anything else, or the cost of electricity is significant after an extended time.\nThe Bitnodes project introduces the Peer Index (PIX) as a way to measure nodes in the network. It is based on 11 properties that can be found in greater detail here. Then nodes are listed on the leader board for all to view.\n\u201cIf your node is not already up on the leader board, make sure that it is reachable by other peers in the network and activate its node status from https://getaddr.bitnodes.io/nodes/,\u201d said Addy Yeow of Bitnodes.\nThere are currently 4,006 active nodes. IP, ISP, client, country and more information is available via Bitnodes.\nYeow accedes that the incentives program is not an ideal solution to completely remedy the growth, or lack, of Bitcoin nodes. Further discussion is needed from the community for problem-solving and figuring out a more long-term solution to encourage individuals and businesses to run long-term nodes.\nRecent updates have extended the 60 day charts to 90 days, a full quarter of a year. This has been done to give a clearer picture of Bitcoin Core version adoption. Also, a STALLED alert has been introduced to notify node operators when their node has not downloaded a newer block from its peers for some time.\nOne of the long-term potentials of Bitnodes is that it could be used to estimate the size of the Bitcoin network that uses newer versions of Bitcoin Core (version 0.8.x or newer). A full list of the Q1 updates for Bitnodes can be found here on Github.\nThe potential for rewarding node administrators exists. Further incentive applications are probably needed, but there is scope for this future development. Involvement from the public is sought since the next gem of an idea can come from anyone.\nGetting Involved\nIf you want to get involved in the programming or the discussion, do so via Github here. The crawler implementation (in Python) is also available from Github and can be found here.\nEven if you are not a programmer or you do not think you can contribute to the discussion on development, you can always be part of the solution by running a node (bitcoin core) and leaving it running on an old computer in a spare room.\nIf you plan to run a node, you should have 50 gigabytes of free disk space, 2 gigabytes of RAM and an Internet connection with uploads of at least 400 kilobits (0.4 mb). Check regularly to ensure you do not exceed your upload limit (if relevant), and that you leave your node running for at least 6 hours a day.\nBitcoin nodes map via bitnodes.io", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 16}

The government of the tiny island is about to pass a new regulatory framework to create a true paradise for digital currencies.\nThe Isle of Man is a self-governing British Crown dependency located in the Irish Sea between the islands of Great Britain and Ireland.\nWhile the United Kingdom is responsible for the island\u2019s defense and foreign policy, the local parliament and government have power over all domestic matters. Business regulations and tax incentives are domestic matters, so the island has the freedom to pass innovative legislation and tax incentives to attract digital fintech firms and professionals.\nIn fact, the Isle of Man has long been a favorite location for online businesses that need a permissive regulatory climate. For example, it has a world-class reputation as an online gaming and sports betting hub that offers a friendly and agile regulatory environment to the operators and at the same time provides strong legal protection to their customers worldwide.\nThe new regulatory framework for digital fintech will be informed by the same principles, and may permit restoring the support of the leading U.K. banks that in 2014, scared by the high volatility of bitcoin, stopped working with the digital currency industry on the island.\nBrian Donegan, the Isle of Man\u2019s head of operations for digital development and e-business, told CoinDesk that the government is moving aggressively to put key measures in place that would help the region\u2019s budding digital currency industry thrive.\nThe Proceeds of Crime Act, which has been altered to account for digital currencies, is expected to come into force at the start of April. A new legislation, the Designated Businesses Bill, will regulate the activities of businesses responsible for holding sums of money, including Bitcoin exchanges.\nPeter Greenhill , head of e-commerce for the Isle of Man, told Business Insider that the aim is to be the most attractive place in the world for cryptocurrency companies to work from, with \u201cfriendly but firm legislation\u201d for digital currency startups.\n\u201cWe have the regulations and infrastructure in place to become a world leader in digital currencies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe already have companies coming in and setting up. We see this as the future and we want to be at the center of development in this area.\u201d\nIt may seem odd that firmly enforced regulations are presented as an advantage for companies operating in a frontier industry that is often threatened by regulators, but Greenhill considers it a necessary step to foster trust in the use of digital currencies.\n\u201cThese companies will be listed on a register that will be strictly controlled by the island\u2019s Financial Supervision Commission,\u201d he told Computer Weekly. \u201cThey will hold their records, have them audited, looked at, and if they see something untoward they\u2019ll take those people off that register and make sure the world knows about it. We set the bar high, and if people don\u2019t meet [our requirements], they can go somewhere else.\u201d\nIt appears that the Isle of Man is aligning with the current trend of fostering the emerging Bitcoin economy and taking it mainstream, but under a firm regulatory framework.\nIsle of Man image via Flickr.", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 16}

According to BitPay, there\u2019s much excitement about the possibilities of bitcoin.\n\u201cBusinesses working in the traditional payments industry are usually excited about getting involved with Bitcoin once all of their skepticism has been addressed,\u201d Julia Patterson, communications manager at BitPay, said. \u201cNo large payments company is going to adopt Bitcoin on a whim, nor should they.\u201d\nBitPay recently partnered with Heartland Payments Systems, one of the largest payment processors in the United States. Heartland has more than 300,000 businesses and educational locations that rely on their technology. Through this partnership, Heartland will be able to recommend which of their merchants would be best suited to use bitcoin.\nHowever, not all merchants have found success with bitcoin. WordPress, a recent client of BitPay\u2019s, decided that it was not worth the support costs to keep accepting bitcoin. They were seeing only a few transactions using bitcoin as the payment method.\n\u201cWordPress is currently updating their checkout process, and we expect to see bitcoin capability added back in,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cAfter talking to WordPress, we think the lapse in bitcoin payments has little to do with bitcoin or our service.\nWith some serious heavy hitters such as Square, Stripe, TD Bank, and others attending Transact 15, this could be a good way for more companies to learn about the potential of bitcoin and potentially integrate it into their workflow.\n\u201cThe Bitcoin technology stands on its own two legs,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to be the best ambassadors for the technology as possible.\u201d\nTransact 15 is starts on March 31stand goes until April 2nd. It\u2019s being held at the Monscone Center in San Francisco.", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 20}

Products that generated the most buzz focused on security for bitcoin users and the general public. Here are the top five products that caught the attention of the judges, experts and the media.\n\nFitcoin\nFitcoin, an iOS app from Chaotic Moon Studios in Austin, Texas, allows users to receive bitcoin for workouts. Simply pair it with Mio Fuse, Jawbone UP3 or Atlas wearable technology. The app tracks the duration, distance and intensity of a workout in real-time. By calculating the energy spent working out into CPU time on a Bitcoin mining rig, users earn slivers of bitcoin. The company does not specify the source of the payment.\n\u201cAt Chaotic Moon we are interested in crypto-tech computing and decentralized services, and wanted to explore them through a prototype that leverages the block chain as application, service layer and platform,\u201d said Ben Lamm, CEO of Chaotic Moon Studios in a press release. \u201cIt was important for us to make this experience compelling, useful and obvious for users by bundling the block chain with the quantified self: translating sweat into equity.\u201d\nThe company hopes this app will appeal to the general public, possibly making digital currencies more popular. They also hope to collaborate with sports apparel companies such as Adidas to offer a discount to app users.\n\u201cWe are excited to see how cryptocurrency can motivate people to make their exercise and fitness routines a long-term habit,\u201d said Jon Werner of Adidas Digital Sports.\nIt is still in an early alpha release phase but generated much buzz at SXSW 2015.\n\nCoinPip\nThe public might be familiar with CoinPip, the bitcoin payment option. Last year, CoinPip Pte Ltd. updated their system so transactions could be converted into 70 regional currencies. At SXSW 2015, the company launched an expansion of their SMS wallet. Users in the United States, Singapore, Hong Kong and Indonesia can now transfer money online to workers living in remote areas in Indonesia.\n\u201cBitcoin is moving on. The power is not just in the currency, but in the technology,\u201d says Anson Zeall, co-founder/CEO of CoinPip in a press release.\nAlong with this latest expansion, the CoinPro is partnering with Melotic, a Bitcoin company based in China to bring a payment service to China.\nLooking ahead, the company will also add the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Turkey, Kenya and the Philippines to their service areas.\n\nLedger Wallet\nIn a promotional video filmed at SXSW 2015, Eric Larchev\u00eaque the CEO of Ledger, tells viewers that his company wanted to bring the best of the Smartcard technology to Bitcoin. The latest innovation is the hardware wallet, which provides protection against hackers and thieves. The device fits in the USB port of any computer. In fact, it resembles a memory stick.\nAs Bitcoin Magazine noted in February, the Ledger Wallet stores transaction keys inside the wallet so it is never stored in the memory of a computer. He claims that even if the computer is compromised by hackers or viruses, the bitcoin will be safe and users will still have full access to their Bitcoin account.\n\u201cIf we want to have mass market adoption, we need to have very secure and simple solutions so that people don\u2019t get their bitcoin hacked or stolen by malware,\u201d Larchev\u00eaque says.\nLedger Wallet was one of the featured start-ups in the SXSW 2015 Accelerator Pitch-off. The event is designed to allow technology start-ups in the early stage to pitch their products to investors, media and experts. It was a finalist in the Innovative World Technologies Category.\nIt is available for sale on their website.\n\nAnchorID\nAnchorID was selected as an alternate in the Innovative World Technologies category at 2015 SXSW Accelerator pitch competition. This platform helps users create a universal login to access sites across the web. Thus, it eliminates the need to remember their usernames and passwords. Users can choose to use Smartphone authentication or biometric technology, such as fingerprint or voice recognition.\nThis patent-pending platform is limited to sites and apps that accept it. With the ever-increasing possibility of mobile malware infecting payment systems, AnchorID claims to offer a secure enterprise authentication.\n\nDigify\nDigify allows users to maintain control over shared content. Through this multi-platform file sharing service, it can notify users if someone is viewing their files or if the files are being forwarded. Users can set their shared content to self-destruct once opened. There are also other options for users, such as view-only and unshared. Through Digify, users can protect their files or calculate how often the file has been viewed by recipients.\n\u201cIn a world of constant digital messaging and sharing where sensitive information can be read by anyone and is out there forever, people need to secure their files or face a very real risk of losing control of their confidential information,\u201d said Augustine Lim, co-founder and CEO of Digify in a press release.\nChosen as the finalist in SXSW\u2019s Interactive Innovation Awards competition in the privacy and security category. Digify is available through Google Play, Apple App Store or the Digify website.\n\n", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 18}

The low transaction costs and easy transfer around the globe indicate that Bitcoin should be considered a legitimate currency, as does the fact that many online providers accept bitcoin. The Credit Suisse analyst wonders whether Bitcoin has the potential to become commonplace and to dislodge the money monopoly from the central banks.\nBut the author thinks the advantage of Bitcoin over traditional currencies \u2013 decentralization \u2013 is also its biggest drawback, because there is no authority that guarantees the value of the currency.\n\u201cA currency is only worth what you believe you will be able to purchase with it tomorrow,\u201d notes the analyst, who considers the huge fluctuations in the exchange value of bitcoin a result of the absence of a central bank able to stabilize the currency and provide confidence.\n\u201cIf this confidence is removed, the value of the currency can decline rapidly, which is what happened with bitcoins at the beginning of 2014. The opposite is also harmful: The increase in value bitcoins experienced in 2013 would have corresponded to an economically crippling deflation if they had been the general means of payment. These fluctuations in value are what is stopping bitcoins from becoming more widespread as a means of payment.\u201d\nThese considerations seem to point to the desirability of new implementations of digital currencies controlled by governments and central banks, similar to the FedCoin proposal by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the digital currency framework that IBM is rumored to be developing for use by central authorities.\nSuch a centrally controlled cryptocurrency would combine the advantages of Bitcoin \u2013 cheaper and faster transactions, permanently recorded in a tamper-proof ledger \u2013 with the value stabilization and user monitoring that a central bank can provide.\n\u201cWho do you trust more, your own central bank or an anonymous online network?\u201d asks the author.\n\u201cNevertheless, bitcoins have a future in certain areas and countries,\u201d states the Credit Suisse article. \u201cWhen combined with the traditional financial system, bitcoins could have cost advantages over credit cards or providers such as Western Union when used as a transaction system.\u201d\nEchoing opinions expressed by Finance Minister of Greece Yanis Varoufakis, the article concludes that \u201cIn countries such as Argentina and Zimbabwe, where confidence in the country\u2019s own currency retaining its value is very low, bitcoins are an alternative that is being used with increasing success.\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 20}

According to Jack Liu, Head of International at OKCoin, that\u2019s going to change.\n\u201cGiven our position as the largest Bitcoin company in China, there is not only a responsibility to grow the wider ecosystem of Bitcoin use cases, wallets and payments, but also a great opportunity on this front,\u201d Liu explained in an email toBitcoin Magazine.\nThis comes on the heels of a report by Goldman Sachs that 80 percent of bitcoin is exchanged into and out of the Chinese Yuan. While Liu does believe this figure is likely exaggerated, he does see some merit in it.\n\u201cDue to the three largest exchanges of OKCoin, BTC China, and Huobi (in that order) all trade BTC against CNY on a 0 spot fee basis, the total volume will naturally be higher,\u201d he explained. \u201cHowever, I do believe that a majority of the volume does indeed trade in China. China is active in the trading and speculative aspect of Bitcoin \u2013 more so than other parts of the world, and this is similar in traditional finance markets where commodity futures are traded quite actively in China.\u201d\nThis new responsibility is linked to expanding consumer and merchant adoption. While he was unwilling to release the specifics on OKCoin\u2019s latest project, he had this to say:\n\u201cThere are great synergies to adding a consumer & merchant product to OKCoin, which we call OKLink. This has been in the works for several months and we are excited to unveil something unique to this product in the coming months,\u201d Liu said. While he wouldn\u2019t say much more, he did say that \u201cwhat we will be releasing will be different than what you see currently on OKLink.\u201d\nWith this slight change toward more consumer applications, there are going to be some in the company who do not fit in perfectly. According to a Reddit post, there has been a \u201cmass exodus at OKCoin,\u201d which had many concerned for the welfare of the company. However, Liu assured Bitcoin Magazinethat the departures were just a function of OKCoin\u2019s rapid growth.\n\u201cThe departures have been over the course of the past couple of months,\u201d Liu said. \u201cA few members are still currently with the company and will stay on in an advisory/consultancy role with the firm.\u201d\nWhile he was unwilling to comment on the specifics of any of the departures, he did say that, \u201cwe are a team of 140-strong and operationally our efforts on the exchange side will continue to be run with the top customer service, product and the most competitive fees.\u201d\nAn increase in consumer adoption, especially in China, would be a big boon to the Bitcoin ecosystem. And as clich\u00e9 as it sounds, with their great power, OKCoin does have a responsibility to the success of the Bitcoin ecosystem.", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 21}

They have attracted some of the best business minds and biggest VC investors. But when Connie Gallippi went to San Jose for her first conference in back in 2013, she saw a different sort of opportunity altogether; the opportunity to create a philanthropic organization that would use the power of bitcoin to help the disadvantaged citizens of the world.\nIt\u2019s been a whirlwind journey for Gallippi since the idea of the BitGive Foundation first took root back in San Jose. Over the past year and a half, the Foundation has attained status as the first bitcoin 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, and has funded projects on behalf of half a dozen charitable campaigns. Most recently, Gallippi visited Kenya to witness the completion of a bitcoin-funded well in conjunction with The Water Project.\nThis Sunday marks World Water Day. Bitcoin Magazine caught up with Connie Gallippi to talk about BitGive and to find out more about BitGive\u2019s involvement with The Water Project.\nBack in February of 2014, Gallippi was looking to fund a water-related project based in Africa when she saw an announcement from Peter Chasse, founder of The Water Project, announcing that his organization was accepting cryptocurrency donations.\n\u201c\u2026emerging cryptocurrencies are extremely low cost and in some cases nearly free to exchange and transfer. The cryptocurrency movement is based on transparency, openness and de-centralization in its design and implementation. At the same time, users enjoy an anonymity more akin to cash-based transactions. The critical difference being that underlying valuations are not decided by a central authority and the movement of that value is unencumbered.\u201d \u2014 Peter Chasse\n\u201cIt was serendipity,\u201d says Gallippi. With a fifteen-year career background in the environmental not-for-profit industry, Gallippi was already keenly interested in water-based issues. Finding a company that understood and was enthusiastic about the potential of bitcoin seemed to be the perfect fit for BitGive. After a thorough investigation of the charity, BitGive was ready to move forward.\nGallippi set a fundraising goal of $10,000 \u2014 the full amount required to complete one well. It was a huge task, but Gallippi wanted the project to be entirely funded by the Bitcoin community. \u201cThere was lots of money floating around at the time,\u201d says Gallippi, so she was optimistic. And while it took longer than Gallippi initially expected, by the fall of 2014, BitGive had surpassed its goal, raising in excess of $11,000.\nFrom that point on, the project proved to be worth all the effort. \u201cIt was an amazing experience to walk hand-in-hand with them through the whole thing\u201d says Gallippi of her relationship with The Water Project. She explains that it was a completely in-depth endeavor; the charity works not only to build the well, but to involve and educate the community regarding the well and its maintenance, as well as sanitation and health.\n\u201cThey really do quality work,\u201d says Gallippi. \u201cAnd they are also really excited about Bitcoin!\u201d\nAs the date of the well\u2019s completion approached, Gallippi began to consider the possibility of visiting the Kenyan village where it was being dug. Wouldn\u2019t it be amazing if she could tell the Bitcoin community the story of how their donations made this project possible?\nWhen she reached out to the Water Project to see if they could help her locate the project and approach the community, serendipity struck again. Peter Chasse told her about a film crew that was going to be visiting a few of their completed projects and he agreed to include the BitGive well. He also invited her to join the team in the field in Kenya. Gallippi put together a funding proposal that would cover the cost of her trip and a bitcoin-oriented film for the BitGive project; and within a few days, BitPesa stepped in to cover the costs.\n\u201cIt was amazing,\u201d said Gallippi. \u201cWe got the whole film project settled in about four days.\u201d\nThe Water Project wasn\u2019t the first of BitGive\u2019s campaigns. It kicked off its efforts back in 2013 by spearheading the first Bitcoin Black Friday charity drive, raising funds for Save the Children following the Philippines\u2019 typhoon disaster. It has since supported campaigns to provide tornado relief to the US midwestern states, to stop the spread of the ebola virus, and support TECHO building homes in the favelas of Brazil. Most recently, BitGive has become involved with Medic Mobile, a platform that supports health-care workers in remote communities of the developing world using mobile technology.\n\u201cMagical things have happened\u201d\nAlthough the BitGive Foundation is largely a one-woman operation \u2014 Gallippi is the only person working full-time at the moment \u2014 it is not without a support system. Since its inception in 2013, Gallippi has had the support of BitPay co-founders Stephen Pair and Tony Gallippi, Connie Gallippi\u2019s brother.\n\u201cTony and Stephen really helped to pull in key players from Day One,\u201d said Gallippi. For example, they helped her to connect with Patrick Murck, who now sits on the Board of the BitGive Foundation. Through Murck, Gallippi was able to secure pro bono legal work from Perkins Coie, who took care of securing the charity\u2019s status as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.\nTo date, BitPay is a Platinum founding donor to BitGive. \u201cWe would never be here without them,\u201d says Gallippi.\nThe BitGive Foundation has also received support from other companies and individuals in the community. Most recently, they teamed with both ChangeTip and Purse.io in its efforts to make donation collection from the bitcoin community easier. Anyone collecting tips through ChangeTip has the option to redirect their tips directly to BitGive. All people have to do is log into their ChangeTip accounts and click on \u201cRedirect your tips to a Cause.\u201d.\nSimilarly, shoppers at Purse.io have the option to participate in the Amazon Smile program. Purse.io enables bitcoin users to shop on Amazon.com for a discount. When shoppers choose to participate in the Amazon Smile program, 0.5% of their purchase amount is donated to the charity of their choice. BitGive has enlisted bitcoin companies to match all Purse.io Smile donations over the next few months.\n\u201cRight now,\u201d says Gallippi, \u201cChain.com will match all donations,\u201d with the matching amounts going directly to the BitGive Foundation, regardless of where the original charitable donation is directed. For example, even if a user chooses to direct the 0.5% donation to the Red Cross, Chain.com will send an equivalent amount to BitGive.\nTo find out more about the BitGive Foundation, or to become member or make a donation, visit their website at bitgivefoundation.org.

To learn more about the BitGive Foundation, see part one of the series. Enjoy this story in Connie's own words and photos.\u00a0\u00a0After a long journey from the US to Nairobi, a short in-country flight, and about 2.5 hours of driving on unpaved and challenging roads, we arrived at the\u00a0Shisango Girls Secondary School near Kakamega, Kenya. We traveled with The Water Project team and were also joined by BitPesa in the field. \u00a0What a surprising and pleasant welcome to see \u201cTogether We Succeed\u201d on the sign when we arrived!\u00a0Within moments, dozens of beautiful girls were surrounding us and excited to meet these strangers who had helped bring them clean, safe water! At first,\u00a0they were a bit shy, giggling and smiling to themselves, but pretty shortly after they broke into\u00a0a traditional Kenyan song to welcome us! \u00a0It was quite surreal; I really opened up to take it all in.\u00a0During our visit over the course of a few days, we had the honor and pleasure of spending time with the girls at the school. \u00a0We shared in their classroom studies, enjoyed a meal with the administrators, and had a very special experience just casually sharing about our different cultures under the shade of a tree. These young girls are bright, committed, and aspiring to do great things! \u00a0They absolutely inspired me and captured my heart!\u00a0The principal of the school, Juliet Washa, is a true treasure! \u00a0She is very dedicated and knowledgeable and truly gives her life to this school. \u00a0She perseveres through so many challenges, including lack of basic things that we take for granted in the Western world, to provide a quality and safe learning environment for the students. \u00a0We were gifted with the opportunity to spend time with Juliet and learn the story of the school and her endeavor to bring clean, safe water to her students. \u00a0Juliet and I have become friends and she, along with the girls, forever hold a special place in my heart.\u00a0We visited the community water source where the girls gathered water before the well. \u00a0In the morning, the girls would carry water from home, some of them walking up to 6 km in one direction. \u00a0This water from the morning trip was not enough to last\u00a0through the day for cooking, drinking, washing, etc., so they would walk to the river midday for more water. \u00a0This river is about 2 km from the school and the water is far from clean. \u00a0We witnessed people driving their cars and motorbikes directly into the river and washing them, saw cows coming for a drink, and learned of a 12-foot long black snake (likely a python in that area) that made this river its home. \u00a0This is where young girls, and the entire community, gather their drinking water. \u00a0Can you imagine?\u00a0Back at the school, I had a truly precious and unique time just being silly with the girls for a bit. \u00a0It was the end of the day, and they were so happy! They wanted to take pictures and dance around; they braided my hair and took turns wearing my sunglasses. \u00a0This time just enjoying them being teenagers was definitely a highlight of this whole experience. \u00a0They are truly shining stars!\u00a0When the water began to flow, it was a truly magical moment. \u00a0The Water Project and their local partners from Bridge Water Project worked hard to plan this well, work with community, and build a reliable water source\u00a0that will last for a long time. \u00a0When they completed the well, clean water began to flow just meters from the school!\u00a0Next door is also a primary school and surrounding the area for several kilometers is an entire community. \u00a0Adults and children came\u00a0flooding in from every direction to see the water begin to flow. \u00a0Dozens of people joined in to be a part of this momentous occasion!\u00a0A huge celebration unfolded before our eyes; it was not expected and we were quite taken aback. \u00a0The girls were singing and dancing around the field for hours, people were flooding in, and a whole ceremony ensued. \u00a0There were speeches from school administrators and dignitaries, song and dance, gifts, and celebration!\u00a0We hope these photos and video tell the story as best as we can tell it now. \u00a0It is next to impossible to share this story in a way that truly honors the experience and gives justice to all the absolutely amazing people we met.Improved health and sanitation, safety from animal and human predators, and more time for studies are just a few gifts this water well has brought to this community in western Kenya.\u00a0They were so incredibly grateful for the Bitcoin community\u2019s gift of water.The true potential of these girls, the community, and of students yet to come, has been unlocked with this new well bringing clean, safe water!For more information about the project, please visit The Water Project \u2013 Shisango Girls School.\u00a0This is part 2 of a 3-piece series highlighting charitable work by\u00a0the Bitcoin community for World Water Day.

But that\u2019s not because Wall Street isn\u2019t interested. \u201cThere is not a hedge fund or institutional investor that doesn\u2019t have Bitcoin on their white board. They know about it, they\u2019re thinking about it. Some even have it in their personal accounts,\u201d explained Matthew Roszak, an investor from Tally Capital. \u201cBut in order for them to jump in the water, they need tools that they are more used to.\u201d There is a perfect storm brewing with respect to Bitcoin and Wall Street.\nThe Winklevoss twins intend to launch an exchange-traded fund [ETF] this spring under the ticker COIN. Barry Silbert\u2019s GBTC gained Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) approval that would allow holders of the shares to trade them on public markets. Alumni from J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and other banks are quickly moving into companies that primarily deal with bitcoin.Despite this, much institutional money has sat on the sidelines for fear of loss assets \u2014 Mt.Gox was only a year ago \u2014 and significant amounts of uncertainty pertaining to legality and scams. Further, as an asset, bitcoin is worth around $3 billion.\nThat\u2019s not a lot when talking about big, institutional money.That could finally be changing.Noble Markets is a venture-backed company looking to work with Bitcoin exchanges to provide further liquidity. John Betts, the CEO, has worked at Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and UBS as the head of development of electronic trading platforms. The pedigree Noble Markets brings to the table could further ease concerns by institutional investors. \u201cThe proximity between the two [Wall Street and Bitcoin] is starting to narrow. All the plumbing that is typically there in other asset classes between trading and clearing and security and domicile, liquidity \u2013 all of those form factors that are abundant in other asset classes. The plumbing for that vis-\u00e0-vis bitcoin is starting to be built,\u201d explained Roszak, a board member for Noble Markets.\nLarge investors need to know that their assets are secure, that there is liquidity if they need to quickly open or exit a position, and that there is actually profit to be made. Right now, the exchanges show that there is money, but what\u2019s lacking is the volume. By connecting with exchanges, Noble Markets will be able to help these institutional investors get in and out of bitcoin with far more certainty. While Noble Markets will be primarily for institutional investors, Roszak did say that the exchange \u201ccertainly won\u2019t scoff at individuals, but it won\u2019t be what Coinbase is doing.\u201d\nIf institutional investors do move into bitcoin, it could significantly increase liquidity and decrease the overall volatility. With more volume trading each day, the acts of one or a few have a smaller impact on the overall price of an asset. In the past 24 hours, 550 thousand bitcoin were traded across the world, while on an average day, there are 58 million shares of Apple traded.\u00a0While Roszak did not want to provide a hard date, Noble Markets is aiming for a launch in the third quarter.", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 24}

Before joining NYSE in 2007, Niederauer was managing director and co-head of the Equities Division Execution Services franchise at Goldman Sachs.\n\u201cThis is an excellent opportunity to contribute to the growing Tera footprint. They are a young derivatives exchange with a great management team and a strong product and sales pipeline,\u201d said Niederauer. \u201cI have already begun advising them on how to approach and capture the opportunities that are emerging in the rapidly evolving global financial landscape for traditional and emerging financial products, such as bitcoin.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re delighted that Duncan has chosen to join Tera at this exciting time for our business,\u201d said Christian Martin, chairman and CEO of Tera. \u201cOur firm operates with the same client-first approach Duncan has shown throughout his impressive career.

Its founder and sole full-time staffer, Connie Gallippi, has helped the organization grow to become the first registered tax-exempt bitcoin charity, spreading the word about Bitcoin\u2019s potential for positive change in the world.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve continuously put out great efforts,\u201d says Gallippi, \u201cand we have a lot of supporters who like our work. The community has been looking for ways to improve its image and reach a mainstream audience. It would be great if we could leverage what we are already doing to accomplish this goal. Our work is making a direct impact today in ways that a mainstream audience can appreciate and relate to.\u201d\nLooking forward, the BitGive Foundation has two immediate fundraising goals: its current campaign with Medic Mobile, and support for the Foundation\u2019s own long-term viability.\nMedic Mobile is an open-source platform that supports health workers in remote communities of the developing world, using mobile technology.\n\u201cMedic Mobile has a mission that connects with our Bitcoin audience,\u201d says Gallippi. \u201cThey are giving out thousands of mobile phones in 21 developing and Third World countries to support healthcare.\u201d\nEach phone is given to a community health worker who volunteers to take care of approximately 30-50 people in a remote village. It takes hours and days for some to walk to and from the closest doctor or hospital to exchange information.\nUsing the phones, along with Medic Mobile\u2019s free, open-source platforms, health workers can communicate directly with doctors, saving them from having to walk for days and the dangers that come with it. They can also register pregnancies, track disease, keep vital supplies stocked and literally save lives in the case of emergencies.\nAside from the obvious importance of Medic Mobile\u2019s work in health care, Gallippi saw the potential for building a network of cell phones in remote parts of the world. Early conversations were about hopes that the long-term effect of the phone distribution might also allow for the creation of hubs for bitcoin transactions, bringing financial and remittance services to the unbanked populations as well.\nThe foundation\u2019s second \u2014 and perhaps most pressing \u2014 campaign is to raise enough money to keep itself going so that it can continue to take on more projects in the future.\n\u201cRight now, I\u2019m the only employee,\u201d says Gallippi, \u201cand the runway is very short for me to be able to stay on full-time.\u201d\nSince the inception of the BitGive Foundation in 2013, there has been support from some key founding donors, including BitPay, Perkins Coie, Jeff Garzik, and Roger Ver, to name a few. As the two-year anniversary of BitGive approaches this June, Gallippi will be wrapping up theFounding Donors campaign.\n\u201cAt the beginning, there was great support,\u201d says Gallippi. \u201cThen the price of bitcoin dropped and things have been pretty slow.\u201d\nShe is hoping that more companies and individuals will want to take advantage of the opportunity to become founding donors, who will be recognized in perpetuity for their contributions to build the first Bitcoin philanthropic organization, before the end of the campaign.\nBesides becoming a founding donor, there are plenty of ways for members of the Bitcoin community contribute to the BitGive Foundation.\nBecome a member. You\u2019ll support the BitGive Foundation\u2019s efforts to offer charitable gifts and campaigns to organizations around the world on behalf of the Bitcoin community. You\u2019ll also receive a T-shirt, discounts on events and a tax receipt.Direct your tips to BitGive. If you have an account with ChangeTip, you have the option to automatically redirect your tips to one of several charitable organizations.Engage in the Amazon Smile program when you shop on Purse.io. A donation of 0.5% of your purchase amount will be directed to the charity of your choice (at no extra cost to the purchaser), and BitGive is registered with Amazon Smile. In addition, BitGive has also secured matching donations from Bitcoin organizations. For the next few weeks, all Smile donations through Purse.io will be matched by Chain.com; those matching amounts will be directed to BitGive.Make a tax-deductible donation. Companies and individuals can offset taxable gains by making a tax-deductible donation to BitGive, a registered 501c3, using LibraTax to help optimize gains/losses and make donations go further.Buy a T-shirt or make a one-time donation through the BitGive Foundation website.\nGallippi\u2019s long-term goal is for the foundation to establish an endowment that will protect the organization\u2019s ability to operate to its full potential.\n\u201cRight now, we can only support one campaign at a time,\u201d says Gallippi. \u201cBut there is potential for things to grow if we have the resources. For now, we have to make our choices very strategically.\u201d\n\u201cOur goal has been to establish a global presence, and we\u2019re doing that,\u201d she adds. \u201cOur stated mission is to improve public health and the environment, and we\u2019re providing a way for companies in the Bitcoin space to give back.\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 25}

If you make a deposit in bitcoin to Bitreserve, you don\u2019t have to worry about volatility, because your bitcoin can be converted to dollars on-the-fly and appear as dollars in your balance. So Bitreserve users don\u2019t lose money if the exchange rate of bitcoin goes down \u2013 if they have chosen to convert part of their holdings to, say, $1,000 USD, they will continue to have $1,000 USD in their account regardless of any fluctuations of bitcoin value.\nOf course, the reverse is also true: if the exchange rate of bitcoin goes up, you don\u2019t make money. But today risk-averse bitcoin users are scared of volatility and many fear that bitcoin will continue to dive as it has done in 2014. In the harsh reality of today\u2019s economy, most individuals and small businesses must carefully manage their finances, and are unable to tolerate even a small degree of volatility.\n\u201cBitreserve is on a mission to democratize the use of digital currency by protecting businesses and consumers from the risks inherent in the bitcoin model,\u201d notes a Forbes review quoted on the Bitreserve website.\nBitreserve users can fund their accounts with bitcoin, and can choose to hold their funds as bitcoin or \u201cbitcurrencies\u201d permanently pegged to gold or to a growing list of fiat currencies, including dollars, euros, pounds, yen, and yuan. Users who choose to convert their bitcoin are still able to send bitcoin payments to other Bitreserve users or external bitcoin addresses, but their bitcoin holdings fluctuate with exchange rates, whereas their converted holdings stay stable.\nRecently Bitreserve announced the launch of two new bitcurrencies: the bitrupee (BitINR) and bitpeso (BitMXN), pegged to two key developing world currencies \u2013 the Indian rupia and the Mexican peso \u2013 now supported by Bitreserve\u2019s cloud money system. Mexican Bitreserve customers will be able to hold their funds in Mexican pesos.\nThe most interesting part of the Bitreserve announcement is:\n\u201cThe bitpeso is key to realizing the potential of our partnership with Bitreserve\u2019s largest investor, Ricardo Salinas-Pliego, one of Mexico\u2019s most admired entrepreneurs and the Chairman and CEO of Grupo Salinas, one of Latin America\u2019s largest and fastest-growing business groups.\u201d\nSalinas-Pliego is the fourth richest person in Mexico behind Carlos Slim and the 168th richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US $8 billion in March 2015.\nGrupo Salinas, a group of companies with interests in telecommunications, media, financial services, and retail stores, is a pioneer in bringing basic financial services to the poor and working class through its retail and banking arm Grupo Elektra. According to the official website, Grupo Elektra, Latin America\u2019s leading financial services company, is \u201cfocused on the base of the pyramid\u201d \u2013 the large mass of Latin American financially disadvantaged citizens and migrant workers in the US. The Bitreserve announcement notes that:\n\u201cWith over 2,600 retail outlets and bank branches throughout Latin America, Grupo Salinas will be a key partner in bringing the benefits of Bitreserve\u2019s cloud money system to millions of Mexicans working in the US and hundreds of millions of consumers and businesses throughout Latin America.\u201d\nThe wording of the announcement and the business model of Grupo Elektra imply that Bitreserve wants to grab a slice of the large market for remittances sent from migrant Mexican workers in the US back to their families in Mexico, in partnership with a major financial services company and community bank. The plan combines the faster and cheaper remittances permitted by Bitcoin with the convenience of using the national currency.\nThe announcement also reveals that Salinas-Pliego is now the main investor in Bitreserve, but the amount of his investment hasn\u2019t been disclosed.", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 23}

What is the compelling use case that will cause millions to adopt bitcoin, knowingly or unknowingly?\u00a0It just\u00a0might be Abra.\nAnnounced on the final day of Launch Festival 2015, Abra is a company that is looking to take a slice of the $550 billion global remittance market. With legacy companies such as Western Union charging 10 percent and more to remit money internationally, Abra offers the potential for instantaneous money transfers at a fraction of the cost.\nAt the event, CEO Bill Barhydt said: \u201cOur mission with Abra is to turn every smartphone into a teller that processes withdrawals. This is not just another bitcoin app. The wallet is a full-fledged digital asset management system, and you don\u2019t have to understand it.\u201d\nUse of the application is straightforward and relies on a network of people around the world who act as tellers, charging small fees to help people transfer\u00a0money abroad. A user can deposit funds into his or her account using a debit card or by meeting up with a teller in person\u00a0and\u00a0handing them cash. Then those funds can be instantly \u2014 the power of Bitcoin \u2014 transferred anywhere in the world. The person receiving the money has only to find a teller, show that he or she is the recipient of the funds, and exchange the digital cash (denominated in USD) back for their local currency.\n\u201cThe teller charges a fee. We take 50 basis points on either side. If the teller doesn\u2019t charge a fee, we don\u2019t charge a fee,\u201d Barhydt explained at the event.\nFurther, there is no foreign-exchange risk. Once the money is in the account, it holds that value for the first three days guaranteed. This ensures that if someone wants to send $200, all $200 can get to the intended person.\nThe killer application\nWhat gives it the potential title of \u201ckiller app\u201d is the fact that Abra is powered by Bitcoin, but the user has no idea that Bitcoin is what is powering it.\nIt\u2019s been said numerous times, but how the network works is less important to someone than whether it works. The average individual doesn\u2019t want to know how the pipes work; they want to know that water is going to come out. The same is true for finance.\nAt the \u201cBitcoin and the Future of Payments Technology\u201d Fireside Chat held at the Museum of American Finance back in February, the panel talked about how people don\u2019t know how the Internet works, but know that if they hit \u201csend\u201d on an email, it\u2019ll get to where it needs to go. No one knows about any of the protocols making that possible.\n\u201cBitcoin will be the same way,\u201d said Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle.\nThe average person using this application won\u2019t need to know that it\u2019s Bitcoin powering the backend either. All users need to know is that their money transferred in minutes and that the fees are significantly less than what they would pay using a service like Western Union.", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 5}

They are:\nfamily visitsofficial business of the U.S. government, foreign governments, and certain intergovernmental organizationsjournalistic activityprofessional research and professional meetingseducational activitiesreligious activitiespublic performances, clinics, workshops, athletic and other competitions, and exhibitionssupport for the Cuban peoplehumanitarian projectsactivities of private foundations or research or educational institutesexportation, importation, or transmission of information or information materialscertain authorized export transactions\nYou can book your flight on CheapAir.com and, before you complete your purchase, we\u2019ll ask you to specify which of the 12 reasons applies.\u201d\nDirect flights between the United States and Cuba still aren\u2019t legal, so flying to Cuba requires a connecting flight to a third country.\nThe CheapAir website says it offers flights to Cuba through Mexico. Though the traveler would have to buy a flight from the United States to Mexico, then buy a separate flight from Mexico to Cuba, CheapAir packages the flights for the traveler.\nAdditionally, traveling to Cuba does require a visa, but acquiring one is a simple process. It costs the equivalent of $25-$30 USD (0.08791- 0.1053 bitcoin as of 3/3/15). They\u2019re available at any gateway airports that offer flights to Cuba.\nDon\u2019t expect to easily use your bitcoin in Cuba, though, as there isn\u2019t even infrastructure yet in place for the use of foreign credit cards.\nCheapair\u2019s website reads:\n\u201cMost U.S. citizens who travel abroad are used to easy access to ATMs (even in very remote locations). At the moment, ATMs are not available in Cuba, though banking relationships are in the beginning stages. In theory, Cuban ATMs could work for Americans traveling abroad in the near future. For now, you\u2019re going to need to bring cash with you and convert to the Cuban Peso at local banks. If your stopover in Mexico City is for more than a few hours, you can also pull money out in Mexican Pesos. But be warned, the Mexican Peso to Cuban Peso exchange rate is notoriously bad. You\u2019re better off exchanging USD, EUR or CAD for Cuban Pesos. Euros and Canadian dollars historically get a more favorable exchange rate on the ground in Cuba. Master Card has been given the go-ahead to accept transactions from Cuban businesses and will be operational by March 1, 2015.\u201d\nThere is possible future opportunity for a remittance market in Cuba. In 2012, Cuba reported $2.6 billion in remittances. Through technology such as Bitcoin, Cubans living in the United States could send money to their families back home for a lower rate than any remittance company. It would also allow individuals to send smaller amounts than ever before.\nAn impediment to this market\u2019s creation, however, is the lack of widespread Internet across the country. If Cubans do acquire wider Internet access, they have an opportunity to skip ATM technology, and \u201cleapfrog\u201d to modern payment systems.\nA few hotels in Cuba currently have Internet service for guests at a premium, but connection speeds are slow and there are time limits on its use.\nCheapAir has uniquely positioned itself to be the only U.S. travel agency to allow people to go to Cuba, and allow them use new forms of money to do so.", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 6}

{"title": "Threshold Signatures: The New Standard for Wallet Security?", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/threshold-signatures-new-standard-wallet-security-1425937098/", "birthday": "Mar 9, 2015  5:38 PM EST", "date": "2015-03-09 22:38:00", "content": "A group of researchers from Princeton University, Stanford University and the City University of New York, have announced a new ECDSA threshold signature scheme that is particularly well-suited for securing Bitcoin wallets.\nThreshold signatures can be thought of as \u201cstealth multi-signatures.\u201d The new Bitcoin security scheme is detailed in a research paper titled \u201cSecuring Bitcoin wallets via a new DSA/ECDSA threshold signature scheme.\u201d\nThe announcement follows three previous posts by Steven Goldfeder on the Freedom to Tinker blog, hosted by Princeton\u2019s Center for Information Technology Policy, a research center that studies digital technologies in public life. Goldfeder is a second-year doctoral student in the Department of Computer Science at Princeton, interested in cryptography, security, privacy and decentralized digital currencies.\nBitcoin wallets often are attacked by increasingly sophisticated cyber thieves. Coupled with the irreversibility of bitcoin transactions, that poses important security problems that decrease user confidence in Bitcoin and could prevent the digital currency from going mainstream if no robust and simple solution is found.\nThe researchers note that the Bitcoin ecosystem needs a breakthrough in security.\nBanks use two or multi-factor authentication schemes: the user\u2019s password \u2013 which may have been compromised by hackers \u2013 isn\u2019t enough to initiate a transaction, but the user must provide at least one more authentication, often by replying to an email or using a smartphone authentication app or equivalent stand-alone device. Today, reputable Bitcoin services such as Circle and Bitstamp use two-factor authentication to provide security, but users must say goodbye to anonymity and provide proof of identity.\nEven more secure three-factor authentication methods that include biometrics are emerging.\nDIY-minded and privacy-conscious Bitcoin users can run their own wallet and \u201cbe their own bank,\u201d but running a wallet has proved to be too much of a security risk. As soon as hackers gain access to the wallet, they can instantly and irreversibly take the money and run.\nCold storage \u2013 keeping the main bitcoin wallet on a device that is not connected to the Internet, and moving only the funds needed for daily expenses to online storage \u2013 often is seen as too much of a hassle.\nTherefore, most security-conscious bitcoin users rely on external services, at the cost of compromising their anonymity and the \u201cDIY spirit\u201d of Bitcoin.\nMulti-signature (multisig) wallets offer a solution. A multisig transaction, for example a 2-of-3 transaction, requires the agreement of the required number of authorized signatories, in this case two out of three. However, the paper shows that multisig transactions present significant usability problems, and serious anonymity and confidentiality drawbacks.\n\u201cBitcoin currently lacks support for the sophisticated internal control systems deployed by modern businesses to deter fraud,\u201d say the authors of the paper. \u201cTo address this problem, we present the first threshold signature scheme compatible with Bitcoin\u2019s ECDSA signatures and show how distributed Bitcoin wallets can be built using this primitive.\u201d\nIn a threshold signature scheme, the ability to construct a signature is distributed among different devices (for example a computer and a smartphone), and each device receives a share of the private signing key. For individuals, threshold signatures allow for two-factor security, or splitting the ability to sign between two devices so that a single compromised device won\u2019t put the money at risk. For businesses, threshold signatures allow for the realization of access control policies that prevent both insiders and outsiders from stealing corporate funds.\nThe researchers built a prototype implementation of a two-factor secure wallet, a desktop client and an Android app, and released open source code on Github. A video shows how the system works: a user initiates a transaction on the computer, and the computer then begins the threshold signing protocol with the phone. The phone will show the user the transaction details and will proceed with the transaction only with the user\u2019s explicit approval. The computer and phone use QR codes to initially pair, and for all subsequent sessions they communicate over the local Wifi network.\nIf threshold signature schemes become common, private bitcoin wallets will support the same multi-factor authentication offered by major wallet providers, while continuing to offer a high degree of anonymity.", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 9}

Outside the United States, Crypto Facilities Ltd., a London-based broker founded by former Goldman Sachs Executive Director Timo Schlaefer, announced the launch of its Bitcoin derivatives trading platform. QuadrigaCX, Canada\u2019s largest Bitcoin exchange, is poised to become the world\u2019s first publicly traded bitcoin exchange.\nMasters is a heavyweight in the financial world. Responsible for credit derivative products at JPMorgan, she became a managing director at 28, the youngest person to achieve that status in the firm\u2019s history. Masters is credited with creating the modern credit default swap, a derivative used to trade credit risks.\nMany observers view a seasoned financial professional such as Masters as someone who can see clearly the real value of Bitcoin and blockchain technologies to the financial establishment: cheaper transactions executed faster than traditional means and permanently recorded in a tamper-proof ledger.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think of bitcoin as being a store of value or an alternative currency or an investment,\u201d Masters said in an interview reported by The Wall Street Journal. \u201cWe think of it as a medium for exchange and a mechanism for recording information.\u201d\nMasters doesn\u2019t much care for the anarchist, DIY spirit of Bitcoin early adopters. \u201cThere is a school of libertarian \u2018visionaries\u2019 who want to imagine a world without big banks, big governments,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s nice, but completely irrelevant to this business model. We don\u2019t imagine a world in which big banks and big governments don\u2019t exist.\u201d\nIn fact, big governments are also warming up to the digital economy, with rumors of \u201cFedcoin\u201d in the United States and some kind of \u201cEurocoin\u201d in Europe, especially in financially troubled economies such as Greece\u2019s.\nBills to allow citizens to pay taxes in bitcoin have been proposed, leading to a possible surreal transition of Bitcoin from a tax-avoidance scheme to a tamper-proof means to force citizens to pay taxes. In the meantime, the government of Ecuador is rolling out its national digital currency.\nDigital Asset Holdings, founded last year by Don Wilson, the CEO of proprietary trading firm DRW Trading and Sunil Hirani, the CEO of trueEX LLC, will create bridges between the emerging Bitcoin fintech and Wall Street, and build a software platform for sophisticated financial institutions to settle trades with digital currencies and digitized versions of more traditional financial assets.\n\u201cIf you can find a way to bridge the two of them then you have something that is truly revolutionary,\u201d Masters said, calling it \u201cthe financial challenge of our time.\u201d\nImage via Sarath Kuchi.\nAn earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to Digital Asset Holding\u2019s software product as a trading platform rather than a settlement platform.", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 11}

More people in my network realize I write about it, so they naturally want to know what it is, how it works and whether it\u2019s a Ponzi scheme.I quickly realized that I had rehearsed the perfect answer to every question. At least, I thought it was the perfect answer to every question.\nThen I read The Age of Cryptocurrency: How Bitcoin and Digital Money Are Challenging the Global Economic Order by Paul Vigna and Michael J. Casey. The two are Wall Street Journal writers, and this is their attempt at explaining the history of digital currency, the inception of Bitcoin, its evolution and future.\u201cOur hope was simply to tell a good story well, to write something that could stand for years as a definitive document. I think we\u2019ve done that,\u201d said Vigna in an email to Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0\nThis book should be required reading for anyone who has an interest in digital currency or the capabilities of the blockchain.The book opens with an implemented use case for Bitcoin. Because of Bitcoin young women in Afghanistan are able to write blogs and do social media and video production. In exchange for this work, they are paid in bitcoin. Bank wires required a lot of fees. And PayPal wasn\u2019t supported. With bitcoin, these young women could be paid instantly.\nThe book then walks through the history of Bitcoin. Even as someone who has covered the digital currency for some time now, it was a refresher on where Bitcoin started, how it had gained its momentum and its tumultuous history.\nWall Street Journal and Bitcoin\nOf all the mainstream media companies, The Wall Street Journal has covered Bitcoin better than all others. Earlier this month Bitcoin showed up prominently on the front page of the paper.\nVigna and Casey are leading that charge at the Journal. They\u2019ve effectively become the expert journalists on Bitcoin. When CNBC wants to find out more about Bitcoin, I\u2019ve seen Casey answering those questions.\u201cJust like at any institution, \u2026 individuals inside of it have gotten interested in Bitcoin,\" Vigna said of the interest. \"In this case, that\u2019s myself and Mike and some others, but it\u2019s the same at Forbes and the (New York) Times and Microsoft and Pantera Capital. At all these institutions, you first need individuals that are interested, that are taken by Bitcoin and its story, and they shape the institutional reaction.\u00a0\nEventually, it looks like an institutional take, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s about the people first.\n\"In February, Casey interviewed Larry Summers, the ex-Treasury Secretary, at the Museum of American Finance. After that, Vigna led a panel with a few individuals to answer questions about Bitcoin.The continuous coverage of Bitcoin can serve only as a positive for the entire community. As more people know about it, more can join in the experience. On March 4th, The Wall Street Journal published some of their readers' comments on Bitcoin. They found that 83 percent of people polled believed there is a future for digital currencies.\u201cBitcoin is one of the most important innovations of our generation \u2014 and comparable in impact to railroads, automobiles, telephony, Internet, etc., if not more,\u201d said a person in Chicago.\u201cFour billion global citizens will finally have modern financial services,\u201d said a person in San Francisco.\u201cI think that\u2019s because Bitcoin is (among other things ) a finance story. Our editors realize that, and telling finance stories is what we do, so they gave us a long leash to chase the story,\u201d Vigna said.\nThe way Bitcoin takes off\nVigna and Casey offered the best route for Bitcoin to take off. If a business paid its vendors in bitcoin, adoption would explode. They citied Wal-Mart, noting that when the retail giant started sourcing in China the surrounding region saw tremendous growth in manufacturing.The same could happen with Bitcoin. If one of the big buyers offered to pay their vendors in bitcoin and it were shown to cut the time it took to pay by days, if not weeks, then those vendors would be more willing to accept bitcoin as payment. That would ultimately result in widespread adoption.As businesses increasingly view it as a valid form of payment, more will accept it. And that will then trickle down into employees being paid in bitcoin.\nIn the end \u2026\u00a0\nBitcoin continues to cement its existence in society. This site is a testament to all that has occurred. But what The Age of Cryptocurrency does is to succinctly explain, without unneeded jargon, a huge amount of history and potential for Bitcoin, all packed into 368 pages. The next time someone asks me about Bitcoin I\u2019m going to hand him or her this book. Even if you know a tremendous amount about Bitcoin, this book will remind you about all the potential that is out there.", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 13}

Further, the defense argues that the government may have tried to hack into the site.\nOn February 4, after only 3 \u00bd hours of deliberation, a New York federal jury found Ulbricht guilty on all seven charges, including drug trafficking, computer hacking, money laundering, running a criminal enterprise and fraud with identification documents. Should the seven felonies stand, Ulbricht would be sentenced to a minimum of 20 years in prison.\nAccording to a memo filed Friday evening, Dratel is looking for a new trial for Ulbricht. The defense is also looking to re-visit a motion that would have suppressed all evidence gained from the Silk Road servers. The defense argues that the evidence was obtained without a warrant, violating Ulbricht\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights.\nFurther, Dratel is arguing that Ulbricht\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights have been violated.\u201cMr. Ulbricht should be granted a new trial because the government failed to provide exculpatory material and information in a timely manner, thereby denying him his Fifth Amendment right to due process and a fair trial,\u201d Dratel wrote in his memo.\nDratel argued that 5,000 pages of material related to the testimony of Department of Homeland Security agent Jared Der-Yeghiayan were not provided in a timely manner. During cross-examination, Der-Yeghiayan revealed that his group had been looking at Mark Karpeles, the owner of Mt. Gox, as the true \"Dread Pirate Roberts,\" the pseudonym used by the site's founder.\nDratel has argued that this evidence was provided only two weeks before the trial started, thus making it nearly impossible for the defense to pull together a proper argument in time for the start date.\nWith respect to the Fourth Amendment violations, Dratel wrote: \u201cMr. Ulbricht\u2019s motion to suppress evidence should be reopened based on information produced by the government in connection with trial, and should be granted in its entirety.\n\u201dThe memo went on to say that: \u201cIn the context of Mr. Ulbricht\u2019s suppression motion, this surveillance raises some novel Fourth Amendment issues, and also provides further evidence that the government discovered the Internet Protocol (hereinafter \u201cIP\u201d) address for the Iceland server ending in \u201c.49\u201d through warrantless TOR network surveillance.\n\u201dDratel argued before that the government had hacked into the server. But the government argued that if the FBI had hacked the Silk Road server it would be legal because the server was based in Iceland and Ulbricht had not made clear that he was the owner. In other words, there can\u2019t be a violation of constitutional rights if no one comes forward to say that their rights were violated.\nUnfortunately for Ulbricht, there were five requests for a mistrial put forth by Dratel during the trial and none were allowed by the judge. It is highly unlikely that these requests will be granted, especially since Ulbricht already has been convicted and he\u2019s requesting the retrial from the same judge who refused a mistrial repeatedly.And Dratel may not be truly looking for a retrial. Instead, the motion might all be part of a larger plan to file an appeal.Ulbricht and his defense team have until April 4 to file their formal appeal.", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 12}

It\u2019s the same money, just not a dollar bill with a serial number on it, but a token that sits on this blockchain. We are at a tipping point right now. It\u2019s making a lot more sense for some type of digital cash in the system, that not only saves our government money, but also is a lot more convenient and secure for individuals to use.\u201d\nUnlike Bitcoin, where the network is decentralized and there is no overseer, IBMCoin would be controlled by central banks and linked to users\u2019 bank accounts, using wallet software that integrates the banking system with IBMCoin. The unnamed source said that IBM has been talking with a number of central banks, including the Federal Reserve. If central banks approve the concept, IBM will build the secure and scalable infrastructure for the project.\nIBM has been doing research on blockchain technology for some time \u2013 at CES 2015 it unveiled ADEPT, a system developed in partnership with Samsung that leverages elements of Bitcoin technology to coordinate a decentralized Internet of Things.\nIf the IBMCoin rumors are true, IBM has chosen the right moment to ride the wave of enthusiasm for Bitcoin fintech in the mainstream financial establishment. From the point of view of states and central banks, the value of Bitcoin lies in its ability to implement cheaper and faster transactions, permanently recorded in a distributed, tamper-proof public ledger.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think of bitcoin as being a store of value or an alternative currency or an investment,\u201d said former JP Morgan superstar Blythe Masters, now CEO of digital economy startup Digital Asset Holdings. \u201cWe think of it as a medium for exchange and a mechanism for recording information.\u201d\nGovernments also are warming up to the digital economy, with rumors of \u201cFedcoin\u201d in the United States and some kind of \u201cEurocoin\u201d in Europe, especially in financially troubled economies such as Greece\u2019s. In a recent research paper titled \u201cOne Bank Research Agenda,\u201d the Bank of England said that Bitcoin could reshape the financial industry and called for further research to devise a system that could use distributed ledger technology without compromising a central bank\u2019s ability to control its currency.\nIf IBM becomes the preferred partner of governments for next-generation fintech based on blockchain technology, the payoff might be huge. It\u2019s worth noting again that this is not an official announcement, but an unconfirmed rumor.\nSpeculating on the possible identity of the IBM source, a participant in a Reddit discussion thread suggests that he might be Richard Gendal Brown, Executive Architect for Banking Innovation at IBM UK. Brown edits a personal blog on the future of finance and recently posted several articles highly relevant to the IBMCoin space.\nCommenting on the Bank of England research paper, he recently noted that \u201c[T]he identity of the issuer really matters.

Antonopoulos, Mike Belshe of BitGo, Eric Lombrozo of Ciphrex, Joshua McDougall and Michael Perklin of C4, Sean Neville of Circle and John Velissarios of Armory Enterprise have agreed to form the steering committee for C4\u2019s CryptoCurrency Security Standard (CCSS).\nThe mission of the steering committee is to \u201censure the CCSS remains up-to-date, neutral and relevant in establishing security standards in the fast changing world of cryptocurrencies.\u201d\nJohn Velissarios, co-founder and CISO of Armory, commented on the newly formed steering committee., \u201cKeep in mind, the wider security world in financial services, telecoms and public sector have been solving similar problems for many years and the experiences gained in these industries are equally, if not even more applicable to the problems facing cryptocurrency companies. The CCSS, supported by C4 Steering Committee members, has a mix of skills, that together provide very wide and deep coverage and I\u2019m confident we can tackle all the challenges that will come our way.\nIn the same post on its website blog, C4 issued an open invitation to the community to contribute to the CCSS.\nWhat is the CCSS?\nThe CryptoCurrency Security Standard is an open standard repository for a set of requirements for any information system that utilizes cryptocurrencies. It\u2019s mission is to enable people and companies using cryptocurrencies to employ best practices that will protect them from security attacks and minimize risk.\n\u201cCCSS is a set of guidelines to help two sets of people,\u201d says Michael Perklin, President of C4. \u201cNewcomers find it immensely valuable because it pulls all of the things you need to do into a single checklist. It makes it easier for them to benefit from the experience/knowledge of the many peers that came before them.\u201d\n\u201cEstablished services will benefit from it when the standard is ratified in Q4 2015 by being able to post completed assessments against the standard so their customers know without a doubt that they are a Level I, II, or III system.\u201d\n\u201cBitcoin started out as an experiment,\u201d says Eric Lombrozo, co-CEO & CTO of Ciphrex. \u201cInitially, the most significant concerns were pertaining to the protocol and the ability for the network to achieve consensus, not scaling it to manage accounts worth millions or hundreds of millions of dollars. Moreover, Bitcoin was from the start a disruptive concept for the existing financial industry \u2013 as such, not many early Bitcoiners had had much experience in existing financial security practices.\u201d\nA Call for Collaboration\nBoth Lombrozo and Perklin emphasize the importance of community involvement in the development of the CCSS. \u201cCCSS is a collaborative effort,\u201d says Perklin. \u201c It\u2019s not some decree written by a centralized committee that the world must follow.\u201d\nVelissarios agrees. \u201cThe wider community can bring a multidisciplinary approach to the crypto currency world and bring decades of experience, which will be immensely helpful to crypto currency startups.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working on enterprise security software for nearly 20 years,\u201d says Lombrozo of his own involvement in CCSS. \u201cWhile cryptocurrencies bring many additional challenges to security, many basic concepts carry over from earlier projects. I hope to bring some of that experience into this space.\u201d\nAnyone with an interest in cryptocurrencies is encouraged to participate in the project. The post lays out a number of ways that people can contribute.\n\u201cWhile security experts have an obvious avenue for contributing, the standard also needs help from graphic designers, language translators, and proofreaders too, just to name a few.\u201d\nAccess to the project can be found on its Github repository as well as via the C4 Slack site#ccss-discussion channel.

Any person (or group of people) can build products that use the open-source network without needing someone else\u2019s permission. This has lead to an explosion of companies looking for new and exciting ways to do just that.\nAmong them, the people behind Mycelium have stood out as consistent creators of quality products. Their Bitcoin Wallet is one of the most widely used mobile wallets and its built-in Local Trader system has been operating for almost a year now, offering users a reliable alternative to LocalBitcoins. Entropy, their newest product, has generated buzz in the community by promising users a cost-effective way to generate secure paper wallets.\nBeyond these ventures, what might be Mycelium\u2019s most exciting product yet is also their oldest. The company actually dates back to 2008 and initially had nothing to do with Bitcoin. At the time they were working on a way to use mesh networking to create an infrastructure-independent, self-powered, text-messaging system. When Bitcoin showed up in 2009, they decided to refocus on finding a way to use the same networking to create an ad-hoc crypto economy. Today that work has manifested itself in the Bitcoincard project.\nMore recently Mycelium has undergone some scrutiny due to connections between their Chief Technology Consultant, Jan M\u00f8ller, and a company called Chainalysis. That company was founded by M\u00f8ller and \u201coffers a service that provides financial institutions with the means to obtain regulatory compliance through real-time analysis of the blockchain.\u201d The discovery of this via a BitcoinTalkthread sparked a swift backlash on Reddit.\nMycelium was just as quick to respond with an explanation that M\u00f8ller hasn\u2019t had access to their nodes since he left his position as Lead Developer to focus on Chainalysis. They went on to say that they \u201care not fans\u201d of deanonymization of transactions via blockchain analysis and further clarified a commitment to user privacy saying \u201cOur goal was to have Mycelium Wallet be as anonymous as Dark Wallet, and that has not changed.\u201d\nI wanted to learn more about Mycelium so I reached out to their community manager, Dmitry Murashchik (/u/Rassah and the author of their Reddit response). He was kind enough to answer some questions of mine concerning the company\u2019s mission, the development process for Entropy, Bitcoin consumer adoption, and more. You can find the transcript below.\n1. Mycelium\u2019s stated mission is \u201cto make bitcoin penetration as prevalent in the lives of people as Internet is today.\u201d Why do you think people need Bitcoin?\nBitcoin offers people a choice of currency that is not at the mercy of a few politicians or bankers, is much more efficient and cheaper to transfer over long distances than any other currency, is the only currency that allows for almost immediate settlement of asset transfers, and is not restricted by political borders like everything else on the Internet. It is really the first currency of the Internet. It also allows for a whole lot of use cases that are simply not possible to do with anything else but bitcoin. In much the same way that telephones and fax machines could not have predicted the rise of things like email, Amazon, Reddit, and YouTube, despite those being based on the same send-data-through-wires technology, there are going to be a lot of Bitcoin-related inventions that we would not even be able to imagine right now.\n2. Are there any other Bitcoin companies (or companies in any field, for that matter) that Mycelium looks to as an example of the \u201cright way\u201d of doing business?\nWe generally look at other Bitcoin wallet and hardware developers, and our community as a whole, to figure out what is best, and what things we should avoid. No one specific, though.\n3. You\u2019ve become a highly regarded institution in the Bitcoin world based on your quality products. Unfortunately, you seem to be the exception. Every day it seems a new Bitcoin-related, scam company is revealed. Why do you think this industry attracts so many criminal actors?\nIt\u2019s the people involved. All of us here are aware that the future economy will depend on reputation more than anything else, and all of us follow voluntaryist philosophy where high ethical standards are extremely important. We also all keep each other honest, and delegate various duties so as not to have one person have enough power to really screw things up. However, despite a large number of scams out there, there are still plenty of companies that have existed since the beginning who are still around and just as honest (BitPay, Armory, and Blockchain.info come to mind). The scam ones are probably just the most sensationalist, especially with them advertising so much to drum up sales.\n4. Bitcoin has obviously seen a ton of price volatility over the past few years going from being worth $2 to $1,000, then all the way back to $200. Do you think this sort of volatility keeps people from using it in the sort of everyday manner Mycelium wants to promote? What can be done to reduce volatility?\nAny volatility like that will keep most people from using a currency. It\u2019s why countries like Argentina, Ukraine, and others who experienced it have to use currency controls to force people to continue to use theirs. But there are still huge benefits of using bitcoin, such as more privacy, the money transfer mechanism, and many others, so people are continuing to use it without being forced to. I don\u2019t think anything can, or should be done to reduce volatility, besides just offering ways for people to hedge their value using options contracts while the currency usage grows. We plan to offer that service soon through Coinapult Locks, directly within our wallets. But I believe bitcoin\u2019s overall volatility will diminish and eventually go away as it gets adopted more widely around the world, just as stock values of large companies become less volatile as companies grow.\n5. The release of your paper-wallet generator Entropy has been delayed for a few months now due to production issues (latest update here). What lessons have you learned from this experience that you will apply to future products?\nTry to do as much in-house as possible, and expect that every little delay would add a week instead of a day or two, since it takes so long to communicate and get feedback from factories. Also, these delays would not even have been an issue if we didn\u2019t need to raise money to make the devices in the first place. Our Bitcoincard has been in development for over three years, and it\u2019s not an issue because we don\u2019t owe that product to anyone yet. So, basically, preorders should be avoided if they can be. But that\u2019s the same lesson that BFL and Trezor has taught before us, which we were very aware and concerned about when we took this route, and turns out for good reasons.\n6. When working with hardware manufacturers, what is their initial reaction when you tell them that you are a Bitcoin company? Are they knowledgeable about the community?\nThey don\u2019t really need to know that we are a Bitcoin company. Actually, the manufacturers for Entropy didn\u2019t even know what they were making. We sent them hardware schematics, paid for and shipped them the electronic components they will need, and paid them to assemble and test it using test software we wrote. That\u2019s it. To them, as long as the software tests correctly on the hardware they made, and as long as the payment cleared, that\u2019s all that matters.\n7. You have a unique view of Bitcoin adoption as one of the premier mobile-wallet providers. What kind of growth have you seen over the past year?\nWe don\u2019t actually get to see a lot of growth through our wallet. Besides Google Play store, we also allow people to download our app directly, and have it on a slew of other app stores, including a bunch of them in China. Most of those we have no way of tracking download numbers from. But in general, based on feedback from our users and fans, the growth has been pretty good, considering the dreadful slide of the price throughout the entire year. It actually seems that our growth has increased a lot just in the last few months, compared to all of last year, so we expect it will increase even more once the price starts going up again.\n8. In an interview with Bitcoinomics you said \u201c(Mycelium\u2019s) main challenge has been trying to keep up with innovation in the Bitcoin space.\u201d What recent innovation are you most excited about?\nFor our wallet, the things we most want to bring out as soon as we can is Coinapult Locks to let people lock in value and avoid volatility, CoinShuffle to allow for complete financial privacy, and BIP70 merchant protocol, which has been out for quite some time, but has taken us way too long to implement into our wallet. We are also excited about the new hardware wallet options, including support for hardware already built into Android phones that Rivetz and Ledger are developing APIs for, multi-signature accounts, and microtransaction channels. So, we have quite a lot of things to add still, all of them huge features that will make Bitcoin either more secure or easier to use.\n9. What is Bitcoin\u2019s greatest strength?\nI would say third-party independence. That means political (you can use it without caring which country issued it or which it\u2019s being sent to), regulatory (you can send it wherever you want without needing your government\u2019s permission), and financial (you can always send or receive it without having to get your bank\u2019s approval, or even depending on your bank actually having your money). For a global economy, where everything else is already on a borderless apolitical Internet, that\u2019s huge.\n10. What is Bitcoin\u2019s greatest weakness?\nAt the moment, the only one I can think of is slow development progress. All the issues that people are worried about already have solutions on paper, but it is taking a very long time for people to actually code, test and implement them. But that\u2019s pretty much the case in any technology, whether software, hardware, biotech, space travel or whatever else: Awesome things are coming, and we all can\u2019t wait for them to get here. So, I guess Bitcoin\u2019s greatest weakness is it existing in an instant-gratification culture.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 14}

The two innovations combined provide unprecedented consumer protection to Bitcoin users, buyers and sellers alike.\nBitrated\u2018s bitcoin payment service uses multisig transactions where a trusted third party (trust agent) is nominated to resolve disputes and reverse payments in case of fraud. Two out of three signatures are required to unlock a payment: the seller\u2019s, the buyer\u2019s and the trust agent\u2019s. So if the buyer is happy with the purchased goods or services, the payment can be unlocked by the buyer and the seller alone, with no intervention required from the trust agent. Otherwise, the trust agent will arbitrate the dispute for a fee, and eventually take either the side of the seller, in which case the payment will proceed, or the buyer, in which case the escrowed bitcoin will go back to the buyer.\nWith multisig, the trust agent is not able to take the money and run, because the payment address is fixed and any decision of the trust agent must still be validated by the seller or the buyer. But as usual, the devil is in the details: a dishonest trust agent could collude with a dishonest seller \u2013 or buyer \u2013 behind the scenes. Bitrated\u2019s reputation management system addresses this problem.\n\u201cWe believe that Bitrated holds the key to the next wave of Bitcoin consumer adoption,\u201d said Bitrated CEO Nadav Ivgi . \u201cWhile disputes about e-commerce are usually settled in a fairly easy process, Bitcoin transactions still hold a major risk of fraud. The new reputation management system is a huge leap forward in consumer protection when combined with the secure payment system, and it can help bring Bitcoin one step closer to the massive numbers of users in e-commerce.\u201d\nBitrated created a marketplace for arbitration services where trust agents can compete for customers by providing quality dispute resolution services, utilizing their domain expertise, building a reputation and offering competitive fees.\n\u201cBecause trust agents never hold user funds in escrow, we can greatly reduce compliance costs, lower the entry barriers, encourage competition and allow smaller and specialized players to participate in a way that was never possible before.\u201d\nTo join Bitrated, users need to create a profile like this and link their social network accounts. At this moment, reputation scores are mostly based on the various karma systems and number of friends/followers on the social networks. Later, it\u2019s to be expected that reputation scores will be based on user reviews, successfully completed transactions and dispute resolutions on the Bitrated system itself.\nTo create a new trade, buyers need to specify what they are buying (a description of the product or service, delivery method and other agreed upon terms), the price in bitcoin, the user name of the seller (an external email address can also be used, in which case the seller will receive an invitation to join Bitrated), a refund bitcoin address, and the user name of the trust agent. Trust agents, who can be found in the Bitrated user database, can specify their fees: a base fee (for example 0.5%) and a dispute resolution fee (for example 2%). If the system catches on, top-rated trust agents whose services are in demand could earn significant fees.\nBitrated is a very welcome addition to the Bitcoin ecosystem, and one that meets an important need. It can be seen as an open and transparent alternative to the native escrow and reputation systems of specific Bitcoin marketplaces \u2013 where often escrow and dispute resolution are provided by the operator itself. Bitrated, which is essentially a public marketplace for arbitration services with a crowd-sourced reputation system, is a good solution to manage trust issues in the digital economy.", "year": 2015, "month": 2, "day": 24}

Enter QuadrigaCX, heir apparent to the title of Canada\u2019s largest Bitcoin exchange.\nAn older version of the CAVIRTEX database, including 2FA secrets and hashed passwords, may have been compromised. Their website states, \u201cWe believe that damage to the company\u2019s reputation, caused by the potential compromise, will significantly harm our ability to continue to operate successfully.\u201d Kyle Kemper, VP of CAVIRTEX, also cited a difficult banking relationship as a contributing factor.\nCAVIRTEX was the second exchange to go down in Canada this year; Vault of Satoshi also declared its intent to close as of February 5th, 2015.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve definitely seen an increase in new accounts over the past few days,\u201d said Gerald Cotten, CEO of QuadrigaCX. He added that the closure of CAVIRTEX came as a \u201ctotal surprise\u201d to him. Like everyone else following the Bitcoin news in Canada, he knew about some of CAVIRTEX\u2019s difficulties, but didn\u2019t think they were serious enough to close the company. \u201cSecurity and banking issues\u2026come with the territory when one operates an exchange,\u201d he said.\nCan QuadrigaCX avoid a similar fate?\nCotten places his faith in the company\u2019s security system. QuadrigaCX clients\u2019 passwords are encrypted both server-side and client-side, on-site and in-browser. Even if someone managed to hack in and steal their password hashes, as in the case of CAVIRTEX, those hashes would be useless to the thief.\n\u201cTotal security is incredibly hard to achieve,\u201d Cotten said. \u201cYou make one little mistake and a hacker can and will exploit it. Banks can\u2019t guarantee they won\u2019t get robbed; exchanges can\u2019t guarantee they won\u2019t get hacked. That\u2019s why we keep as little [bitcoin] online as possible.\u201d The rest of the funds are kept in cold storage. Cotten added that QuadrigaCX participates in the Bug Bounty program run by Crowdcurity, so their system is continuously being tested for weak points of entry.\nAs for its banking relationships, QuadrigaCX appears positioned to keep legacy banks onside. When it comes to banks, said Cotten, an exchange is \u201calways walking on eggshells.\u201d Before its launch on December 26, 2013, QuadrigaCX registered with FINTRAC as a money services business, becoming the first exchange to do so in Canada. While it isn\u2019t strictly required by law, such registration is perceived by banks as a sign of legitimacy, and registration has minimized the number of banking issues the exchange has had to face. QuadrigaCX was also the first Canadian exchange to integrate INTERACTMOnline.\nIt also helps to have a little luck. Just before it was thrust into the spotlight, QuadrigaCX began a global marketing campaign to expand its business outside of Canada, targeting more international markets. At the moment, it carries CAD/BTC, USD/BTC and Gold/BTC order books, and accepts clients from most countries around the world. Due to regulatory complexities, however, QuadrigaCX does not accept U.S. clients.\nAs for the prospect of other foreign exchanges encroaching on the Canadian Bitcoin space, Cotten isn\u2019t worried. He points out that Bitstamp and Bitfinex are already active in Canada, but he doesn\u2019t foresee too many other companies making a push into the Canadian market. \u201cTrading volume is still very low [here],\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not really worth it for them.\u201d And Canadians who might try to migrate toward foreign exchanges are likely to find the process too complicated and expensive by comparison.\nTo see a recent, in-depth interview with Gerald Cotton, and learn more about QuadrigaCX, visit decentral.tv. For this episode of Decentral Talk Live, Cotten spoke with host Ethan Wilding and guest host Hai Nguyen shortly before the CAVIRTEX announcement.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 2, "day": 23}

Bitcoin exchanges like BitStamp, which are not licensed banks, must often wait hours or even days for a transaction to be cleared by an external bank. But because Fidor Bank is fully licensed, it is able to provide a direct interface to the mainstream banking system, eliminating transaction delays.\nAs a result, holders of a \u201cFidor Smart Giro Account\u201d are now able to purchase bitcoin directly from a bank account and receive bitcoin immediately after the purchase. They can also sell bitcoin to another Smart Giro Account holder and have the money instantly credited to their account. Since the money is always in the user\u2019s bank account, customers don\u2019t have to worry about the possible insolvency \u2013 or dishonest behavior \u2013 of an external exchange operator.\nThe Smart Giro Account is a full bank account with all the standard features, including interest on credit balances and a low-cost credit card. The latter is, in practice, equivalent to a card that can be recharged with bitcoin.\nOliver Flask\u00e4mper, board member of bitcoin.de, said, \u201cThat is not only good news for all Bitcoin fans, but also good news for fintech companies based in Germany. \u201c\nFidor Bank CEO Matthias Kroener commented: \u201cThe prompt conducting of [Bitcoin transactions] from one bank customer to another bank customer enhances security massively.

Kroener praised U.S. authorities\u2019 open and pragmatic middle-of-the-road approach to Bitcoin regulation.\nKroener is persuaded that traditional U.S. banks are losing their appeal, especially among younger generations, because they don\u2019t offer the innovative services that today\u2019s tech-savvy consumers demand.\n\u201cThe reason that a lot of very successful fintech startups are happening in the U.S. is not only because there are so many talented people setting up those businesses. It is also because there is a huge gap in innovative services.\u201d\nFidor Bank is known as a modern Internet Bank and an early adopter of new trends in fintech with innovative services for connected consumers. Fast Company named Fidor Bank one of the world\u2019s top 10 most innovative companies of 2015 in personal finance, and described it as a social bank that leverages cutting-edge technology to respond to customer wishes.\nFidor Bank\u2019s fintech community website invites developers, notably dubbed \u201cPirates of Banking,\u201d to become \u201cpart of reshaping the post-crisis banking industry through cutting-edge technology instead of doing the minimum to be compliant.\u201d The deployment of innovative fintech services in the U.S. market could boost the mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin and the digital economy as a whole.", "year": 2015, "month": 2, "day": 25}

The new payment app developed by Rivetz and other partners \u2013 an Android alternative to Apple Pay with Bitcoin support \u2013 will be available in the second quarter of 2015 and is compatible with over 350 million existing Android devices, including Samsung smartphones. Demonstrations on a Samsung Galaxy 4 smartphone will be held daily at the Samsung partner booth (Hall 8.1), Trustonic booth (Hall 7, Stand 7G81), and at the Intercede booth (Hall 7, Stand 7B81).\n\u201cWe are very pleased to be combining trusted computing technology with the innovations in Bitcoin and blockchain technology to offer consumers the most secure bitcoin payments,\u201d Rivetz CEO Steven Sprague told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cFor consumers, the killer app is having money on the phone, and for the merchants, the built-in security of the system will make it easier to persuade them to accept bitcoin.\n\u201cRivetz developed this application over the last year, integrating the contributions of the partners and using the Trustonic Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) as an operating system for the application. Our solution reflects the latest specifications for mobile payment technology by Global Platform and Trusted Computing Group,\u201d he said.\nWith Apple Pay, announced at the iPhone 6 launch event last September, Apple wants to grab a big slice of the exploding \u2013 and potentially very profitable \u2013 mobile payments market. Apple Pay is compatible with a wide range of point-of-sale payment solutions used by merchants, including the terminals provided by the major credit card companies, but requires an Apple device (iPad, iPhone 5 or higher) on the consumer side. That is an important limit since only 12 percent of smartphones in use are made by Apple, and most are older iPhones that don\u2019t support Apple Pay.\nGoogle is not watching idly \u2013 it recently acquired Softcard technology to power its payment solution Google Wallet \u2014 and established agreements with Verizon, ATT and T-Mobile to pre-install Google Wallet on the smartphones sold by the carriers. Google Wallet is available for Android smartphones, which have an 85 percent market share. (Note, however, that not all Android devices support Google Wallet at this time.)\nBesides smartphones, both Apple Pay and Google Wallet will also run on next-generation smart personal devices, such as connected watches, which will add to their appeal and ease of use. But Apple Pay and Google Wallet don\u2019t support Bitcoin, which is an important limitation for the fast-growing community of Bitcoin users, consumers and merchants alike. The new Android payment solution, developed by Rivetz, Trustonic, Intercede and Bitcoin payment processors Coinapult and BitPay, supports bitcoin payments and can be integrated with bitcoin wallets.\n\u201cRivetz is delivering state-of-the-art support that will help Bitcoin [become] a standard, secure capability on every handset,\u201d said Tony Gallippi, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman of BitPay. \u201cWe look forward to enabling the Rivetz capability as an option for millions of Bitcoin users.\u201d\nThe new open-source payments technology is easy to use and compatible with any Trustonic-enabled smart device. The solution is compatible with many thousands of Bitcoin merchants, offering consumers peace of mind that their Bitcoin transactions are safe, private and secure. Furthermore, the new solution meets all of the requirements of the recently implemented regulations for European payments using smart devices, which opens the way for deployment in Europe.\nThe new solution developed by Rivetz uses Trustonic\u2019s Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) built into millions of smart devices to store and process Bitcoin private keys, and Trusted User Interface (TUI) technology for secure PIN entry and secure display of the users\u2019 transaction details. Rivetz provides a software developer toolkit for secure TEE-enabled Bitcoin payment apps.\n\u201cWe are pleased to be working with Rivetz to bring state-of-the-art security and ease of use to consumers,\u201d said Trustonic CEO Ben Cade. \u201cThe Rivetz team is offering a great model for any app developer to leverage the advanced security that Trustonic TEE provides.\u201d\nIntercede\u2019s MyTAM cloud service is used to protect the user\u2019s bitcoin wallet and data from malware and any threats that may be present on the handset.\n\u201cApps used for executing Bitcoin transactions are an attractive target for hackers, who are developing increasingly advanced methods to deploy their malware onto Android handsets,\u201d said Intercede CEO Richard Parris. \u201cBy ensuring the activities of apps are kept separate and secure from the main OS, end users can be assured their Bitcoin transactions are protected.\u201d\nThis development is important for the Bitcoin ecosystem, because it integrates bitcoin payments in a comprehensive, secure mobile payment solution that is technically as advanced \u2013 or more advanced \u2013 than competitors Apple Pay and Google Wallet, supported by leading smartphone manufacturers, and fully compliant with applicable regulations. It will facilitate Bitcoin adoption among consumers and merchants, reduce regulatory obstacles and bring Bitcoin closer to mainstream.", "year": 2015, "month": 2, "day": 25}

With this announcement, BitGo joins the list of industry leaders including Xapo and Coinbase that offer insurance for bitcoin stored using their services.\nAll of BitGo\u2019s paying customers are eligible for protection under the XL policy for up to $250,000 in covered theft claims, just by signing up for BitGo services. Customers can increase the amount of protection available to them for an annual fee.\n\u201cWe are proud to partner with XL Group and Innovation Insurance Group on this game-changing insurance product,\u201d said Will O\u2019Brien, CEO and co-founder of BitGo. \u201cThe entrance of an underwriter of XL Group\u2019s size and reputation signals that the technologies and standards for Bitcoin security, like multi-sig, have reached a threshold of viability to take the industry to the next level. For our large enterprise customers, an insurance-backed guarantee is the final missing ingredient for peace of mind in a robust security software offering.\u201d\nThe customized insurance product, exclusive to BitGo, was structured in collaboration with XL Group and Innovation Insurance Group LLC. It is a robust cyber and professional liability policy that goes well beyond narrow crime policies previously adopted by some bitcoin vault providers. BitGo partnered with Ty Sagalow, president of Innovation Insurance Group LLC, to develop and negotiate this unique product. This was an obvious choice, according to O\u2019Brien. \u201cTy Sagalow has over thirty years of experience in launching innovative products in the insurance industry. He was instrumental in structuring this unique bitcoin insurance policy with XL Group.\u201d\nBitGo customers who opt-in to the program are protected from acts, errors or omissions of BitGo technology, processes and employees, including external hacking incidents and employee theft. Both hot wallets and cold storage are eligible for coverage in the policy.\nThis insurance coverage is unique because in the event of a covered loss, the policy would reimburse BitGo\u2019s customers directly for the value of the lost or stolen bitcoin. This is similar to how the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) operates; it reimburses bank depositors directly for the value of their deposits (up to $250,000) in the event a bank is unable to return those deposits.\n\u201cIn collaborating with BitGo and Innovation Insurance Group, we tailored a first-of-its-kind insurance product to help protect the rapidly growing Bitcoin industry,\u201d said John Coletti, Chief Underwriting Officer, Cyber and Technology Insurance, XL Group.\n\u201cBitGo\u2019s multi-signature architecture delivers a significant level of security, realizing how seriously they take cyber security.

In a posting on the Bitcoin Foundation forum, before the first ballots were even cast, Perklin listed several concerns:\nA significant and cumbersome number of steps that voters need to take before being able to cast a vote.The new voting platform is not mobile friendly.The order of candidate names appears to be static but also random. (Who chose that order and why?)Privacy concerns.Entrusting voter email addresses to another third party \u2013 in this case, Swarm.\nThese concerns and others were quickly reiterated by fellow candidates Olivier Janssens, Jim Harper and Bruce Fenton, as well as many forum participants.\nCandidate Olivier Janssens went so far as to accuse Patrick Murck, Director of the Bitcoin Foundation, of \u201ca serious breach and a clear attempt at throwing a wrench in the machine\u201d and \u201ctotally and purposefully [manipulating] the voting process.\u201d He then called on the Foundation to cancel the voting round immediately and switch back to the earlier Helios platform.\nCandidates Jim Harper and Bruce Fenton also called for a reset. Bruce Fenton noted that some voters have complained that his name wasn\u2019t listed as a vote option. \u201cI agree that it should be reversed immediately,\u201d he said in a forum post. \u201cI don\u2019t think the results are trustworthy.\u201d\n\u201cI think we can reach consensus among candidates about restarting the election on the original system,\u201d Jim Harper stated in the online forum discussion. \u201cGiven that a full day has already passed when voting was supposed to be underway, I think resetting the vote, with a new announced start date and voting period, would be best, but I\u2019m open to discussion.\u201d\nOther concerns that emerged included lack of adequate explanation, lack of transparency in the decision-making process and publication of results while elections are still ongoing.\nIn response to the heated discussion on the forum, which saw voters calling the whole process \u201ca complete mess,\u201d \u201c baffling,\u201d and \u201ca disaster\u201d \u2014 some going so far as to refuse to participate in the election at all \u2014 Patrick Murck has agreed to re-launch the run-off elections.\nIn his latest post, he says: \u201c\u2026 I\u2019m glad we took a chance to innovate and spark a conversation. I\u2019m also glad that we had a fallback option in place in case things didn\u2019t work out. Whether or not you believe voting on the blockchain is a worthy avenue to explore, if the system isn\u2019t working for voters then we should move on.\u201d\n[Updated at 4:25PM EST]\nIn written comments to Bitcoin Magazine,Murck said, \u201cThis clearly struck a nerve with folks that think blockchain technology should only be used for transferring Bitcoin and not other [applications] like voting. [It] sparked a debate on how people use the blockchain.\u201d He also said that there were many people who were excited to try using blockchain voting. Joel Dietz, founder of Swarm, could not be reached for comment.\n[Updated at 5:53PM EST]\nThe Bitcoin Foundation has released a new blog postoutlining the new election process. Here are some of the most important details:\nMembers will receive an email from Helios to vote. Ballots cast on Swarm are not valid. Members who cast a vote via Swarm already will need to recast their votes using Helios.Members will receive Helios emails by end of day today (Wednesday, February 25, 2015 at 11:59pm EST).The runoff election will be extended by an extra day. The new deadline for voting is Saturday, February 28 at 11:59pm EST.Election Results will be posted on Sunday, February 29, 2015.\nThe post states, \u201cWe knew this was going to be messy and that there was a risk that it might not even work. In response to the difficulties with user interface and ballot presentation, in order to maintain the integrity of the runoff election, as promised, we are hitting \u201creboot\u201d and starting over. \u201c\nThe Foundation also thanked members for providing feedback on its first attempt at implementing on-blockchain voting and encouraged them to continue to test out the Swarm platform and give feedback, even though votes cast there will not be counted.", "year": 2015, "month": 2, "day": 26}

Crypto Facilities trades financial products such as bitcoin options and futures, allowing users to \u201cgo long\u201d and bet that the price of bitcoin will rise, or \u201cgo short\u201d and bet the price will fall. The first derivative offered by Crypto Facilities is a forward contract \u2013 a contract to buy or to sell an asset at a specified future time at a price agreed upon today \u2013 on the U.S. dollar price of bitcoin. The forward contract serves to hedge against bitcoin volatility, or to benefit from future swings in the bitcoin price.\nThe forward contract comes with different maturity months, and traders can choose from the nearest three in the March, June, September and December cycle. Once a forward reaches maturity, it will be settled automatically. Traders do not have to wait until maturity to get out of their position, but can trade out at any time. Buying one forward \u2013 the minimum trading unit \u2013 requires a minimum deposit of 0.50 bitcoin. To sell short one forward, the minimum deposit is 0.25 bitcoin.\nAs of this morning, one forward at September 15 was trading at USD $242, while the current Crypto Facilities Instantaneous Bitcoin Price Index (CF-BPI) was USD $236. The CF-BPI is calculated continuously based on the current best bid and ask prices observed on major bitcoin exchanges.\n\u201cOur forward is probably the simplest and most effective tool out there to protect yourself against bitcoin volatility,\u201d said Crypto Facilities Co-Founder and COO Jean-Christophe Laruelle. \u201cIf you want to lock in the value of one bitcoin, you sell one forward.\nForward contracts are traded between investors on the platform developed and managed by the brokerage, which matches sellers with buyers without acting as a central counterparty and takes a commission on all trades based on the official fee schedule. The brokerage, targeted at institutional investors and expert individual investors used to trading derivatives and futures, operates in bitcoin.\nCrypto Facilities, which employs a team of qualified financial experts, was founded by Laruelle, a former Senior Trading Architecture Designer at BNP Paribas/Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and Schlaefer, a former Executive Director in Credit Quantitative Modelling at Goldman Sachs who holds a doctorate in financial engineering.\nThe firm, registered with the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) as an appointed representative for broking exchange-traded futures and options, adheres to strict compliance and security standards and holds bitcoin deposits in cold storage on offline, encrypted servers.\nThe availability of mature financial products such as Crypto Facilities derivatives shows that Bitcoin is taken more and more seriously by the financial establishment and that \u2013 like or not \u2013 the Bitcoin space is becoming more professional and mainstream.\n\u201cThe Bitcoin space still lacks professional, reliable marketplaces, and this is what we provide,\u201d Schlaefer said. \u201cWe apply the same standards in terms of risk management, compliance and reporting as you would see in the traditional finance space.\u201d He added that the firm has a number of additional financial products in the pipeline and plans to expand its range of services.\nSchlaefer told CNBC that he saw real potential in the technology behind Bitcoin \u2013 the blockchain \u2013 which is a publicly-distributed ledger system that makes sure all transactions are verified in a transparent, decentralized and secure fashion. The CNBC article observes that, like Schlaefer, the Bank of England has also said it sees huge potential for the technology behind Bitcoin.\nIn a recent paper titled \u201cOne Bank Research Agenda,\u201d the central bank said that Bitcoin could reshape the financial industry. A section of the paper (Page 31), dedicated to a Fedcoin-like scenario where central banks might issue digital currencies such as Bitcoin, notes that both the technology and financial sectors need to be engaged, as each brings important and distinct expertise.\n\u201cCreating such a system would entail creating a protocol for value transfer over the Internet, akin to what Berners-Lee did for information,\u201d the Bank of England paper says.", "year": 2015, "month": 2, "day": 27}

Maybe, if you live in one of three states now considering bills in support of that option.\nIn January, Utah Republican state representative Mark K. Roberts introduced a bill, H.C.R. 6, to create a Council on Payment Options for State Services that will study how Utah could accept Bitcoin as a valid form of payment. The bill includes the possibility for Utah residents to pay state taxes using Bitcoin.\nIn February, eight New Hampshire state representatives introduced a bipartisan bill, NH HB552, to propose that New Hampshire should officially accept Bitcoin for taxes and fees. The bill calls for the development of a detailed implementation plan, followed by operational acceptance of Bitcoin by the state before July 1, 2017.\nIt seems almost surreal that Bitcoin, often portrayed by the popular press as a means to avoid taxes and hide cash and illicit activities from the government, could find one of its first official applications in tax payments.\nThe short and pragmatic text of the New Hampshire bill only mentions the financial implications of collecting tax payments in Bitcoin. Republican Representative Eric Schleien believes that the adoption of Bitcoin for tax payment purposes would be a boon for the state, and argues that Bitcoin transactions are cheaper and more secure than those made with credit cards, so that the law would offer both state and taxpayers a more reliable payment option at a reduced cost.\nThe Utah bill is more visionary. It mentions the important benefits that an official adoption of Bitcoin could bring to the state\u2019s technological leadership and economy:\n\u201cTechnology industries, including emerging technologies, play a growing role in [economy] and culture. The state must also remain open to new technologies and ideas to continue attracting talented and educated entrepreneurs. [Bitcoin] provides merchants with an attractive alternative mechanism for accepting payments, because transaction fees for Bitcoin are generally much lower than those imposed by other payment processors. \u201c\nReading between the lines, a key passage here is \u201cattracting talented and educated entrepreneurs.\u201d Rep. Roberts seems fully aware that new, disruptive technologies can create fast growth and \u201ciPhone moments\u201d that boost entire industries. He appears to be persuaded that Utah could become a Silicon Valley for cryptocurrency business. Perhaps someday visitors to Utah will be greeted by a \u201cBitcoin Rockies\u201d sign.\nUtah is also the home state of Overstock, a large online retailer that allows customers worldwide to pay in bitcoin. Overstock is also behind one of the most interesting and potentially disruptive developments in the Bitcoin space: their Medici crypto-stock exchange project aims to create an open alternative to traditional stock exchanges such as NYSE and NASDAQ, based on blockchain technology and accepting Bitcoin payments.\nThe Free State Project, a hardcore Libertarian group based in New Hampshire, greeted the New Hampshire bill with a blog post titled \u201cBitcoin for Taxes and Fees? Only in NH.\u201d\n\u201cNew Hampshire is known as a libertarian hot spot, and the Bitcoin community here is strong. Read about the rich connections between Bitcoin and the Free State Project here.\u201d\nMeanwhile, last week, Democratic member of the New York City Council Mark Levine introduced a bill that would allow residents to pay for any fines and fees they owe the city using Bitcoin. In an interview with CoinDesk, Levine said:\n\u201dIt started with realizing how much money the city of New York is losing on transaction fees on credit cards, ultimately it\u2019s several million a year because of all sorts of fees and fines. [I] think that being the first major city in the U.S. to make this move sends a clear signal that we\u2019re innovators here.\u201d\nLevine\u2019s arguments are similar to those used to promote the New Hampshire and Utah bills: accepting Bitcoin payments would save the city a lot of money, and a vibrant Bitcoin economy would attract top tech talent to the city.\nThe passages quoted represent two often conflicting aspects of the developing Bitcoin economy: the business-oriented vision of a regulated Bitcoin economy that informs the Utah and New York City bills, and the free-wheeling Libertarian spirit reflected in the Free State Project comments to the New Hampshire bill. As often happens, future Bitcoin developments are likely to be influenced by both.", "year": 2015, "month": 2, "day": 27}

Students were required to verify enrollment by signing up with an email domain ending in \u201cedu.\u201dAt the time Coinbase founder, Fred Ehrsam, announced the limited time offer on Twitter, it was only available to a handful of \u201cedus.\u201d\nNow the international digital wallet has posted a list of the top 10 schools with the most signups. The University of Michigan led the way with 941 signups. The University of California, Berkeley wasn\u2019t far behind with 939 signups, the University of Illinois had 873 and the University of Texas ranked number four with 698 signups.Some users complained via Reddit that they were having trouble signing up.

Earlier this month, more than 4,000 MIT students enrolled in the 2014 fall semester will receive $100 worth of bitcoin.The brains behind the program, Jeremy Rubin and Dan Elitzer, were able to launch the program after receiving nearly half a million dollars in donations from MIT alumni and the bitcoin community.\u201cGiving students access to cryptocurrencies is analogous to providing them with internet access at the dawn of the internet era,\u201d said Rubin.While many are excited about the giveaway, some are curious about what will happen if they try signing up with a school that\u2019s not yet listed.\nOthers say the promotion could be taken advantage of by non-students creating an email account with the domain \u201cedu,\u201d which some experts say is relatively easy to do. Drew Cordell of CyptoCoins News wrote, \u201cIf the promotion is meant to have a long duration, it will need to be refined significantly in order to prevent abuse and provide full access.\u201dDespite Ehrsam\u2019s reassurance that abuse will be prevented, Cordell argued, \u201cIt is very simple to create an .edu email address for free in minutes. Creating false email accounts could allow users to abuse the system and continually claim the $10 bonus if the system is not well regulated.\n\u201dBy offering young people a chance to invest in Bitcoin, companies like Coinbase could be key players in expanding the market for digital currencies. This could potentially ensure monetary freedom for the future by allowing bitcoin into the hands of our youth.Coinbase currently has over one million consumer wallets, 30,000 merchants, 5,000 API applications and U.S. bank integration. They also have a remote team consisting of 35 contractors.\n\n\n", "year": 2015, "month": 2, "day": 28}

Michael Perklin finished third with 52 percent approval followed by Bruce Fenton with 50 percent.\nOut of 595 confirmed voters, 440 votes were cast (74 percent). In order to be elected, candidates had to be approved by at least 50 percent of eligible voters. In the first round of voting, none of the 13 candidates met that 50 percent approval threshold, so a run-off election among the top 4 candidates was held.\nOlivier Janssens, a libertarian and voluntaryist, ran on a platform of decentralizing core development, bringing full transparency to the Foundation, and focusing on widespread adoption of bitcoin around the world.\nJim Harper brings an extensive breadth of knowledge and experience to the position. He is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, where he focuses on privacy, telecommunications, intellectual property, security, government transparency, and digital currency. In 2014, Harris served as Global Policy Counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation.\nJanssens and Harper will begin their two-year term officially on March 15, 2015.\nIn statements released to members and posted on the Bitcoin Foundation blog, Brian Goss, Elections Committee Chairman thanked members for their participation. \u201cFrom members to bystanders, we appreciate all the feedback and suggestions for improvement along the way.\u201d\nPatrick Murck, Executive Director of the Bitcoin Foundation added, \u201cI look forward to working with our newly elected board members, and congratulations to every candidate for your active participation.\u201d\nThe run-off election began on February 25, accompanied by confusion and outrage from its members. While the first round of voting had been held using the Helios voting platform, at the eleventh hour, a new on-blockchain platform run by Swarm was suddenly introduced. Amidst concerns over security, lack of clarity and transparency, system integrity, and voter disenfranchisement, the Foundation heeded the candidates\u2019 unanimous request for a restart. Votes cast on the Swarm platform were discarded and the process began again the next day, using the former Helios system. The voting period was extended by a day and concluded on Saturday.\nIn response to the decision to move the election back to the Helios platform, Murck said, \u201cThis clearly struck a nerve with folks that think blockchain technology should only be used for transferring Bitcoin and not other [applications] like voting. [It] sparked a debate on how people use the blockchain.\u201d\nThe majority of the criticism on the Bitcoin Foundation forum, however, focused on the poorly managed process rather than on the concept of on-blockchain voting itself.\nNot that there wasn\u2019t concern over the principle idea. Core developer Peter Todd was critical of the on-blockchain concept from the start. As he stated in an email to Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cThe big picture is that voting generally already involves a central entity \u2014 the organization \u2014 so the decentralisation that the blockchain gives you isn\u2019t needed. What you do need is strong auditing of the honesty of that central entity, which is a problem that\u2019s already well studied, and has some really nice solutions that are only available in systems with a central entity.\u201d\nTodd also raised concerns about the inherently public nature of the blockchain and the difficulty that poses in maintaining secret ballots, as well as the potential for miners to reject ballots that they don\u2019t agree with.\n\u201cWhile there are ways around this problem,\u201d he concluded, \u201c why bother when better non-blockchain voting schemes like Helios already exist and have undergone peer review?\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 2}

The BIT will be an interesting option for traditional investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin who prefer not to trade Bitcoin as currency. The BIT is sponsored by Grayscale Investments, a part of Silbert\u2019s Digital Currency Group.\nCurrently, the BIT, launched in 2013, is a private, open-ended trust that is invested exclusively in bitcoin and derives its value solely from the price of bitcoin. It enables accredited investors, with annual incomes greater than $200,000 or assets of more than $1 million, to gain exposure to the price movement of bitcoin for a minimum investment of $25,000 without the challenges of buying and securely storing bitcoin. BIT-accredited investors are shielded from hacking attacks and unregulated entities, which would be appealing for small investors as well. But the BIT hasn\u2019t been publicly available to small investors so far.\nThe Winklevoss twins also are planning a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF, which will be available to all investors on NASDAQ with the ticker COIN. The launch date is unknown, but Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss say that everything is proceeding according to plan. According to their Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, the value of COIN shares will reflect the dollar exchange rate of Bitcoin on Winkdex.\nThe Winklevoss ETF is still going through the lengthy ETF registration process with the SEC. But BIT is taking a shortcut, permitted by a rule that that allows holders of a private fund to sell their shares publicly after a 12-month lockup period and completing a less arduous approval process with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Without SEC registration, the BIT can\u2019t formally be considered as an ETF, but once existing shares are offered publicly it will be equivalent to an ETF in practice.\nSilbert said that FINRA granted BIT\u2019s request for a permanent ticker symbol, GBTC, which \u201cis expected to be effective shortly.\u201d\nIn a statement, the Digital Currency Group said, \u201cAlthough we have been assigned a ticker symbol, no assurances can be given as to when or if such trading will commence, or that an active public secondary market for BIT shares will develop or be maintained.\u201d\nEach share of BIT is worth approximately one-tenth of a bitcoin. As of Friday, the trust\u2019s net asset value stood at $24.43 per share. The Wall Street Journal article notes that many investors purchased their BIT shares in 2013 when the dollar exchange rate of bitcoin was about $100, so they would make a profit selling now. New investors, including small investors, will be able to buy BIT shares soon.\nBitcoin space and the traditional stock market are increasingly converging, and the Bitcoin economy as a whole will continue to have DiY and \u201cunderground\u201d aspects. But it is evident that regulated, professional Bitcoin services will become more common, and take Bitcoin closer to mainstream.", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 2}

The merger will create the first publicly traded U.S. Bitcoin derivatives exchange.\nAs observed by The Wall Street Journal, this is a reverse merger where Tera will take a controlling stake in MGT. Tera doesn\u2019t seem too interested in MGT\u2019s gaming operations, so the operation is primarily a way for Tera to go public. In other words, Tera is buying a public listing on the stock market for its Bitcoin operations.\nTera has played a leading role in the development of Bitcoin derivatives. In September 2014, Tera launched TeraExchange, the first regulated U.S. Bitcoin derivatives exchange, and TeraBit, a spot Bitcoin price index based on real-time data from a number of Bitcoin exchanges. The TeraBit price index is used as the settlement rate for USD/Bitcoin derivatives transactions.\nTera is active in the Bitcoin space, which is booming. Forget the highly volatile dollar exchange rate of Bitcoin, the important parameters are the number/volume of Bitcoin transactions and the venture capital investments in the emerging Bitcoin industry, both of which are skyrocketing. Consumers spend bitcoin online, and investors bet on the innovative potential of Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology. Technology expert Peter Diamandis said Bitcoin is going from deceptive to disruptive, and listed Bitcoin among his top tech picks for 2015.\nThat should be interesting for investors, but currently only a few publicly traded companies and funds \u2013 including Overstock, Bitcoin Shop and the forthcoming Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF \u2013 are active in the Bitcoin space. With this announcement, the new Tera-controlled MGT joins the select Bitcoin club.\nDerivatives such as Tera\u2019s forwards are the simplest way to expose investors to Bitcoin, especially those investors who prefer not to trade the digital currency itself \u2013 and are the easiest way to profit from the ups and downs of the bitcoin-dollar exchange rate.\nIn related news, former Goldman Sachs Executive Director Timo Schlaefer announced the launch of Crypto Facilities, a U.K. Bitcoin derivatives broker. This confirms the growing interest of institutional investors in the Bitcoin economy.\n\u201cThe proposed merger with Tera gives immediate and future value to our stockholders, while creating a robust platform for the growth of the industry\u2019s first publicly listed bitcoin derivatives exchange,\u201d said H.

But the details surrounding what type of business models are subject to this license category still needs further clarification, says Jillian Friedman, legal counsel for theBitcoin Embassy in Montreal.\nThe email also states that the new interpretation of the MSB law will take effect immediately: There is no grace period. The AMF representative said, however, that those businesses that submit requests for a license within a reasonable time and who cooperate with the AMF will normally be allowed to continue their business activities while their license request is being processed.\nAmber Scott, founder and Chief AML Ninja at Outlier Solutions Inc. broke down the policy document in a recent Decentral Talk Live episode, as well as in a follow-up interview for Bitcoin Magazine. (Watch the full Decentral Talk Live episode on decentral.tv here.)\n\u201cThere are no special circumstances for small businesses who might have one or two interactions with clients in Quebec,\u201d she said. Scott said that companies who do business with Quebecois clients have two practical options at the moment: Register with the Quebec Autorit\u00e9 or stop doing business in the province. For online money services businesses, that would mean filtering and blocking all traffic originating from a Quebec IP address.\nAs for ensuring compliance, Scott expects that the AMF likely will begin by focusing on companies doing a significant amount of business in Quebec. Anyone found not to be registered would probably receive a letter requesting compliance with the policy, followed by further enforcement measures.\nThe Bitcoin Embassy in Montreal, home to its own bitcoin ATM, came out with the following response shortly after learning about the new policy statement:\n\u201cWhile we welcome the intention of the Province of Quebec\u2019s financial regulator \u2026 to clarify the regulation of bitcoin ATMs, we are surprised by the lack of transparency and involvement of the Bitcoin community in this decision. However, this development had been expected by the community, and the Bitcoin Embassy views this decision as an implicit recognition that Bitcoin is indeed a legitimate monetary alternative to fiat currencies.\u201d\nThe Bitcoin Embassy also expressed surprise that the AMF did not wait to see what regulations its federal counterpart, FINTRAC, is currently drafting. The Embassy statement noted that Quebec is now the only province that imposes these requirements on Bitcoin ATM operators.", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 2}

Android Pay will not be a separate payment app, but a platform that enables developers to integrate mobile payments into their apps using an API layer.\nGoogle's senior vice president of Android, Chrome and Google Apps Sundar Pichai announced the upcoming payment platform at the Mobile World Congress\n\n\nhttp://www.mobileworldcongress.com/\nhe said at a press event\n\nGoogle Wallet, the native Google payment service that was launched in 2011 but didn\u2019t gain as much traction as Apple Pay, will continue to exist but it will become one more application built on the Android Pay framework.Initially, Android Pay will use near-field communication (NFC). Later, it\u2019s expected that Google will enable Android Pay to use biometric devices such as fingerprint scanners.\u00a0\nThe data of Android Pay users will be stored locally so that payments can be made even without a data connection. To improve security, Android Pay will generate a one-time credit card number, or token, for each transaction.\u201cAndroid Pay will allow companies to add a mobile payments option to their app, to which users can upload credit card or debit card information, so that payments become single-tap transactions within the app,\u201d a source close to Google told Ars Technica. \u201cIn addition, a company adopting the Android Pay API will be able to allow tap-to-pay transactions in brick-and-mortar stores. This function will rely on Google\u2019s Host Card Emulation (HCE), which makes it easier for third-party apps to take advantage of Android phones\u2019 Near Field Communications (NFC) chips.\u201d\u00a0\nFurther details are likely to be revealed by Google at the Google I/O conference in May.Another secure payment solution for Android\u00a0developed by Rivetz, Trustonic, Intercede and bitcoin payment processors Coinapult and BitPay is being demonstrated at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona\u00a0and\u00a0will be available in the second quarter of 2015.

Every time you create a new account your online profile expands, increasing the risk of breach with one or all of your accounts. Private keys and passphrases should be managed as securely as possible, and the same for login credentials. The following tales are filled with valuable lessons for stepping up your game with digital identity management.\nGone Phishing\nPaul Boyer, creator of the \u201cMad Money Machine\u201d podcast on the \u201cLet\u2019s Talk Bitcoin\u201d network, learned a tough lesson recently. Paul happily received donations totaling 3.3875 bitcoins, about $2,000, from loyal listeners until he discovered a zero balance in his wallet at the end of June 2014. He collected donations using a payment service provider normally paying out bitcoins in U.S. dollars on a daily basis, but he never submitted a bitcoin payout address, so the coins just accumulated, awaiting the attention of hackers. That was his first mistake.\nA creative BitPay look-alike phishing scheme cleverly disguised an email with a \u201cView Invoice\u201d link requesting the refund of a customer payment. Unfortunately, Paul took the bait by clicking the link and unknowingly handed his password to the hacker who changed the payout address and received 3.3875 bitcoins the following day.\nOne last mistake: Paul hadn\u2019t activated a security feature for his account known as \u201c2-factor authentication,\u201d which would have prevented hackers from cashing in his bitcoins, even if they had hacked into his computer.\nFortunately, 2-factor authentication is becoming more widely used on Bitcoin platforms. After a standard username and password login, a 2-factor box pops up asking for a code generated by a smartphone app such as Authy or Google Authenticator. If hackers obtained your login credentials, they couldn\u2019t log in without your smartphone and the code. The lesson here is to activate every 2-factor authentication available upon setting up a new account\u2014and beware of downloading overhyped free software.\nIdentity Ransom\nLongtime Bitcoin evangelist Roger Ver was attending a conference when friends started messaging their suspicions of a Facebook imposter. Someone hacked into his old Hotmail account using it like a master key to retrieve logins for other accounts. The hacker demanded a 37.6-bitcoin identity ransom worth $20,000 at the time. Roger offered up a 37.6 bitcoin table-turning reward via Facebook and Twitter for info leading to the hacker\u2019s arrest. The viral bounty was too much for the hacker to bear, so he or she quickly bowed down, handed over login credentials and disappeared.\nNo bitcoins were stolen, but this tale shows how a single email account can be an attack vector or weak point for exposing an entire online digital identity. When the same email is used for all accounts it effectively weaves everything together with a single thread. In addition, the more well-known and the more perceived wealth someone has, the greater the risk for getting attacked.\nA Tale of Social Engineering\nSam Lee, CEO of Bitcoins Reserve, and his company were victims of a creative social engineering attack starting with the U.S. Marshals\u2019 public email leak of the Silk Road Bitcoin auction list. Hackers were licking their chops over a juicy list of high rollers handed to them with a white glove.\nSam then got an email from a hacker asking for a media interview while proceeding to open a Google docs link supposedly containing interview questions. The link unleashed malware that sucked out all the usernames and passwords from his Chrome browser, leading to control of all the company\u2019s email addresses. The hacker then sent an email from Lee\u2019s account to the CTO requesting a client withdrawal of 100 bitcoins\u2014 worth about $65,000. In this case the \u201cclient\u201d was actually the hacker and the bitcoins evaporated.\nBrowser-based password managers are convenient but non-secure ways to store passwords. The hackers took over Lee\u2019s entire digital identity but still couldn\u2019t penetrate the company\u2019s securely stored bitcoins. However, it\u2019s hard to defend against a hacker falsely posing as a trusted party, one of the slickest tools in a hacker\u2019s toolbox. \u201cThis is a weakness in our internal processes and procedures; it has nothing to do with weaknesses in Bitcoin because frankly Bitcoin so far has none,\u201d says Lee.\nKeys to the Kingdom\nAndroklis Polymenis, aka klee, is an early Bitcoin adopter and NXT stakeholder who recently discovered his $1 million stash of bitcoin and NXT, another cryptocurrency, had vanished. The breakdown likely came from a hacker who found klee\u2019s unencrypted plain text password file sitting in Dropbox, where klee had left it exposed. He responded by putting out a 500-bitcoin bounty, worth nearly $300,000, for return of the stolen crypto and identification of the hacker, who eventually returned 462 of 1,170 bitcoins while keeping the rest as the bounty in exchange for klee calling off the hunt. In the meantime, the NXT community was able to rally together and retrieve some of the stolen NXT tokens.\nAlthough about two-thirds of the cryptocurrency wasn\u2019t recovered, it could easily have been a total loss. The keys to the kingdom were practically sitting on a park bench waiting to be picked up.\nIt\u2019s a painful lesson highlighting the importance of safeguarding bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. Armory founder Alan Reiner, a self-proclaimed ultra-paranoid crypto-nerd says, \u201cHolding your own bitcoin is like harnessing fire,\u201d and then adds: \u201cSometimes the biggest threat to users is themselves.\u201d\nConclusion\nThere are many great password managers, however LastPass has multiple two-factor authentication options with a free version available for individual users and an enterprise paid version for businesses. The paid version, only $24 per user per year, has an admin dashboard for multiple users and access controls. It even has a security scorecard showing the strength of your overall password profile. The free personal version can plug into a separate enterprise account for a seamless user experience. In addition, install anti-virus and anti-malware software on your computers.\nYou can\u2019t afford to waste another day. If one account gets hacked they can all get hacked. Your password manager contains the keys to your kingdom so create and remember a good password. Start securing your digital identity and your bitcoins with these seven easy steps and go on more vacations with all the time you save. The average person has 25 logins per day, so one minute of fumbling per login multiplied by 250 working days equals 2.6 wasted weeks per year logging into websites. Enjoy peace of mind on your newfound vacation instead!\nSeven Steps to Digital Security\nLet\u2019s put some golden security nuggets to use before we end up as another cautionary tale. Best practices for digital identity management are encompassed in the following seven steps.\nStep 1: Choose Platform\nSelect a password management system such as LastPass, Secret Server, OneID or Roboform, create an account, activate two-factor authentication and start adding website and login credentials. Browser-based password managers should not be used, so just do a Google search for reviews on the best password managers. Businesses should create an enterprise level account with an admin console for managing users. You are 100% responsible for managing your bitcoins, so reducing the risk of compromising your entire online profile starts by managing one account at a time.\nStep 2: Add Sites\nOnce the password manager is set up, you can easily add sites by logging into an account as you normally would. Most systems will prompt you to save the site with a simple click. You can also add sites manually with the URL, site nickname, username and password. If you previously saved all your usernames and passwords in a spreadsheet, adjust the columns to the import format and upload. Easy tutorials are usually available for mastering the setup.\nStep 3: Test Sites\nAlways go back and test-click the site after saving it whether you save sites one by one or import a list. Sometimes little nuances like the login URL or username need to be adjusted. When you create new accounts the URL automatically picked up by the system is often not the login URL, so testing and correcting helps to avoid frustration.\nStep 4: Delete the Old List\nAfter you\u2019ve successfully transitioned from a password list it\u2019s time to delete the file. If you set up a password manager and keep your old file then you have not reduced any risk. If you\u2019re among those who have a difficult time parting with the old for fear of losing access to something or wanting to keep it just in case, you can get over the hump by copying your old password list and pasting it into a secure note available in most password managers.\nStep 5: Create a Unique Email\nEmail is the golden thread that weaves your entire digital identity together, and unfortunately, most folks use the same email and the same or similar passwords for all their accounts, including social media, financial accounts and everything in-between.\nThe critical distinction is understanding how emails are used for both communication and account creation. Securing your online identity means that these two roles must be separated by using two different email addresses.\nIn other words, the email you use for communication should be different from the one you use for new account setup. Create a new second email account without using your own name or a word that could be associated with you. For example, set up an email like (any word)[email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=\"currentScript\"in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\"),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\"cf-hash\"))return t[e]}();if(t&&t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(\"data-cfemail\");if(a){for(e=\"\",r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]> */or use the random password generator to create an email \u201cprefix\u201d such as [email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=\"currentScript\"in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\"),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\"cf-hash\"))return t[e]}();if(t&&t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(\"data-cfemail\");if(a){for(e=\"\",r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]> */[email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=\"currentScript\"in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\"),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\"cf-hash\"))return t[e]}();if(t&&t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(\"data-cfemail\");if(a){for(e=\"\",r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]> */Then swap the email on each site with the new email the next time you log in. It will be easier to change accounts one by one instead of turning it into a major all-at-once project.\nStep 6: Change Passwords\nHackers can simply use brute force to break an easy-to-remember password. Change all of your passwords to a minimum 16-character, hard-to-break random password using the random generator provided within the password management software.\nPassword resets should be done in conjunction with the new email resets described above. If you can\u2019t remember the password then it\u2019s harder to break. If you use a password manager you no longer have to remember passwords because the system keeps them encrypted.\nStep 7: Secure Bitcoin Wallets\nBitcoin-related sites may require special attention beyond standard login credentials. Sometimes a passphrase, a group of random words, is required to access your bitcoins. If you lose the passphrase you lose your bitcoins, period, so it must be handled very carefully.\nSome sites don\u2019t have standard login credentials and only require a passphrase. In either case, the passphrase should be saved in the encrypted password field in the password manager. Also consider writing down your passphrases and keeping them in a safe.\nThere are many other advanced techniques that are beyond the scope of this article, but these strategies are meant to significantly reduce risk for people who would otherwise keep login credentials in a text file, spreadsheet, on scrap paper or in draft emails.\n\nThis article originally appeared in yBitcoin magazine.", "year": 2015, "month": 1, "day": 29}

That\u2019s because all companies, whether general merchants or Bitcoin service providers, are now capable of integrating the Bitcoin protocol into their core product without being forced to give up control of their bitcoins to a third party, or without facing the multiple and complex Bitcoin security challenges that have brought otherwise strong companies to their knees.A bit of non\u00adtechnical explanation here: API stands for \u201capplication programming interface,\u201d a set of tools that allow developers to integrate functionality into their software that they would have otherwise had to build themselves. Instead of having to manually write and maintain a secure wallet, companies are now able to simply integrate BitGo\u2019s secure wallet into their software. That leaves them free to focus on taking full advantage of Bitcoin as it relates to their product, rather than worrying constantly whether their integration of Bitcoin will produce a potentially devastating security vulnerability. Simply put, Bitcoin can now be integrated into products faster and more securely than ever before.To realize how important this is, it may be useful to take a brief tour through a couple of recent security breaches in the Bitcoin world.Probably the most notable and widely reported incident in Bitcoin\u2019s history was the loss of 850,000 bitcoins held at the now bankrupt Mt. Gox exchange in Japan. At Bitcoin\u2019s peak price, Mt. Gox was holding roughly $1 billion worth of customer funds\u2014while its software was developed and maintained predominantly by a single inexperienced engineer.There are many theories in circulation about exactly how and why Mt. Gox lost its bitcoin holdings, but one thing is certain: The company was not following appropriate security measures relative to how much value it was storing.Across the world, on January 4th, six years and a day after Bitcoin\u2019s initial introduction, the Slovenia\u00ad-based Bitcoin exchange Bitstamp also suffered a security breach in its hot wallet software. The breach resulted in the loss of 19,000 bitcoins\u2014a small amount relative to Bitstamp\u2019s total bitcoin reserves, but still of grave concern to them and the larger crypto world. But what followed was very different than the situation at Mt. Gox.The day after discovering the security breach, Bitstamp took its service offline and began rebuilding its entire exchange platform. By January 9th, the rebuilding process was complete and Bitstamp announced the relaunch of its services. During the relaunch, Bitstamp became the first major Bitcoin exchange to integrate BitGo\u2019s multi-sig technology via the now public BitGo Platform API. Nejc Kori\u010d, CEO of Bitstamp, had this to say: \u201cBitGo is the only company in the industry we trust to secure our hot wallet. The integration was very straightforward, and now I can sleep better at night knowing that my customers\u2019 holdings are secured with BitGo.\u201dIt didn\u2019t take long for other leading companies in the Bitcoin space to begin updating their architecture with the BitGo Platform API. Among them are Lamassu, a Bitcoin ATM with 40% market share, LibraTax, accounting software for Bitcoin taxes and bookkeeping, and TradeBlock, a digital currency data company (backed by the noted VC firm Andreessen Horowitz) offering an institutional order management platform.\nIn addition to announcing the public availability of its API and first set of platform developers, BitGo confirmed that its flagship product, the BitGo Enterprise web wallet, is in fact built over the new Platform API. This interesting bit of news implies that BitGo\u2019s API has already gone through extensive real world testing by powering the company\u2019s very own suite of products.Like BitGo\u2019s other products, BitGo holds one key for each wallet created using their API and acts as a co\u00adsigner for all bitcoin transactions. Before co\u00adsigning, thereby allowing an irreversible transfer of bitcoin to take place, BitGo validates the requested transaction against a set of fraud detection, business logic and treasury policies. BitGo does not control your bitcoin because they only have access to one key, two are required to perform a transaction. Under normal circumstances, one would use their own private key in conjunction with BitGo\u2019s in order to initiate a transaction. In the event BitGo\u2019s server went down or one wanted to move their bitcoin without requiring BitGo to co\u00adsign, a third emergency private key is available to the user which allows them to bypass BitGo completely.With the total amount of venture capital investment into Bitcoin now topping $400 million and merchants including the likes of Microsoft, Dell, Dish Network, Expedia and Intuit looking to further build out their Bitcoin offerings, the BitGo Platform API looks to be hitting a sweet spot in the market. As fewer CIOs and CTOs ask one another, \u201cWhat is this Bitcoin thing?\u201d and instead ask, \u201cWhat is your Bitcoin strategy?\u201d, scalable security solutions are bound to play an ever-\u00adincreasing role in Bitcoin\u2019s adoption rate. End users should thus expect to see more companies integrating their products further with Bitcoin while suffering far fewer security breaches.As for the people behind the enterprise, BitGo\u2019s founders consist of: \u2022 CEO Will O\u2019Brien, a former executive at Big Fish Games, which last November was bought for $885 million by Churchill Downs; \u2022 CTO Mike Belshe, a founding member of Google\u2019s Chrome team and co\u00adinventor of the SPDY protocol, which has forced the Internet Engineering Task Force to finally begin work on HTTP/2, for which SPDY served as the base implementation; \u2022 CPO Ben Davenport, who sold his startup Beluga to Facebook in 2011. Beluga went on to become Facebook Messenger.BitGo launched the world\u2019s first multi\u00adsig wallet, invented by Belshe, back in August, 2013. The following year, Gavin Andresen, chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation and Bitcoin\u2019s lead core developer, stated, \u201cThis is the year of the multi\u00adsignature wallet.\u201d With the introduction of an enterprise\u00ad grade multi\u00adsig wallet API, 2015 appears to be the year that infrastructure companies can confidently begin storing more and more value on the Bitcoin blockchain.", "year": 2015, "month": 1, "day": 30}

Bitcoin is potentially such a technology and much more. The fact that it can disrupt the largest and most interconnected marketplace in the world\u2014money, banking, and finance\u2014makes it perhaps the most promising investment opportunity of our age.\nUnlike our current increasingly unstable and unpredictable financial system, Bitcoin has 21st century technologies at its very core. The digital currency and clearing network is open source, mobile, peer-to-peer, cryptographically protected, privacy oriented and native to the Internet. The fusion of these technologies allows for a level of security and efficiency unprecedented in the world of finance. These are some of the areas in which Bitcoin-oriented technology can directly compete:\n$2 trillion annual market for electronic payments,$1 trillion annual e-commerce market,$514 billion annual remittance market,$2.3 trillion hedge fund market,$7 trillion gold market,$4.5 trillion cash market,$16.7 trillion offshore deposit market.\nIts potential is not going unnoticed. After it had been praised by tech moguls as Bill Gates (\u201cA technological tour de force.\u201d) and gmail founder Paul Buchheit (\u201cBitcoin may be the TCP/IP of money\u201d), the money started speaking. We saw investments into Bitcoin by top venture capital brass such as Marc Andreessen, Reid Hoffman, and Fred Wilson; by billionaires such as Richard Branson (Virgin) and Li Ka-shing (richest man of Asia); by iconic executives such as Vikram Pandit (Citigroup), Max Levchin (PayPal), Tom Glocer (Reuters), Bill Miller (Legg Mason Capital); and recently also by large cap companies such as Google, New York Stock Exchange, USAA (American bank & insurer), BBVA (2nd largest bank of Spain), and NTT Docomo ($75b Japanese phone operator).\nThe core value proposition of this network is the fact that, in the words of IBM executive architect Richard Brown, \u201cBitcoin is a very sophisticated, globally distributed asset ledger.\u201d What Brown and others hint at is that Bitcoin will in the future be able to serve not only as a decentralized currency and payment platform, but also as the backbone for an \u201cInternet of property\u201d.\nThis entails a decentralized global platform, smartphone- accessible, on which companies and individuals can issue, buy, and sell stocks, bonds, commodities and a myriad of other financial products. The effect will be to remove much of the current bureaucracy and barriers to entry, presenting a huge opportunity for the world\u2019s 2.5 billion unbanked people.\nThis raises the question: why Bitcoin, and not some other cryptocurrency? The answer may lie in the network effect: of all the cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is the one with the highest adoption rate and the strongest security. The combined computing power of the Bitcoin mining industry serves as a protective firewall around the payment network, with a replacement cost of nearly $1 billion\u2014and it is growing quickly. In short: no other cryptocurrency is as secure as Bitcoin. This attribute in itself attracts more capital, which in turn makes the network even more secure and performant.\nBecause of its robustness, the Bitcoin network is now the reference protocol for the new paradigm in finance. And just like TCP/IP became the mainstay for the Internet of information, the Bitcoin network will likely become the value anchor for the Internet of money and finance. Speed may be provided by off-chain or side-chain transactions, but for the high-value transactions of tomorrow, Bitcoin could very well become the security-providing reference currency.\nSo, how much of all this potential is already realized?\nWell, since inception of Bitcoin in 2009 to January 2011, its market cap grew to $1.5m. From there, it rocketed to $145m in January 2013, to reach $4 billion in early 2015.\nDespite a steady price decline in the 12 months following the fall 2013 rally, year on year adoption trends markedly point upwards: as of early 2015, there are 7.9 million bitcoin wallets (+148%), the trading volume on exchanges is $23 billion (+57%), Bitcoin is accepted by 82,000 merchants (+128%), there are 320 bitcoin ATMs (up from only 4), and the network hash rate is 335 pth/s (+8,500%).\nEnticed by its great potential, the investments in the Bitcoin ecosystem are taking off rapidly. In 2013, little over 40 VC deals were made that raised a total of $96 million. That number nearly quadrupled over 2014, with $335 million invested. Based on these numbers, VC\u2019s such as Marc Andreessen compare the Bitcoin system in 2014 with where the Internet was in 1993.\nFurthermore, the Bitcoin price has been rising at an exponential rate. This can be explained mostly by the fact that it is a scarce commodity (maximum supply is 21 million) with a rapidly growing user base. Here are a few possible scenarios for the future value of one bitcoin:\n\nThe scenarios projected above are, of course, not cast in stone. Bitcoin faces several risks going forward. These include:\nThe emergence of a much better digital currency that steals its market lead,An undetected bug in the system,A sustained attack by an organization with substantial computational resources,A coordinated clampdown on Bitcoin by a multi-national entity such as the G20.\nHow serious of a risk do these challenges pose? Let us examine them.\nA better currency is possible, but experience shows that disruptive protocols\u2014such as SMTP for email and TCP/IP for Internet\u2014have proven to be very resilient once adopted by a critical mass of the population.\nAn organized attack on the network is possible but expensive, and there are many potential defense mechanisms.\nAs with any software application, the discovery of bugs may destabilize the system, but the open source nature of Bitcoin allows for many eyeballs to help track problems, and many brains to help figure out a solution.\nThat leaves government clampdown as the most likely risk to Bitcoin. However, with many regulators implicitly or explicitly already accepting Bitcoin, and the robust, decentralized nature of its network, such a move would have little long-term structural impact and is thus unlikely.\nBecause of its strong network effect, the outcome of the Bitcoin story is likely to be binary: either it will experience a downfall as it is superseded by a vastly superior technology, or the value of bitcoins will rise dramatically over the coming years as an increasing share of the global population adopts the currency.\nIn any case, to me it\u2019s exceedingly clear that the technology of the cryptocurrencies is here to stay. Bitcoin does not appear to be a fad or bubble, nor merely a one-off hedge against gold. With a risk-reward proposition this attractive, holding a small percentage of bitcoins in one\u2019s portfolio as a speculation on increased adoption may be one of the wisest investment decisions of our age.\n\nThis article originally appeared in yBitcoin magazine.", "year": 2015, "month": 1, "day": 31}

The company has spent months carefully and quietly planning to take the app public. Including running the payment and merchant services app through testing with a security firm. And holding Q&As in order to perfect their software and get everything right before debuting to the world.\nThe free conference ran from January 24\u201325 at the Central Foundation Boys\u2019 School on Cowper Street, London. LazyCoins Founder and CEO Danial Daychopan calls London, \u201ca great place for bitcoin businesses and entrepreneurs.\u201d\nDaychopan began his talk at the conference on the importance of security. He stressed this is the number one focus for both their exchange and their merchant services app, to guarantee \u201crock solid security\u201d for their users.\nLazyCoins announced the beta version of their new exchange six months ago in July, but they chose not to go public right away in order to learn from and avoid the mistakes of other exchanges. They launch in direct competition with similar-service industry leaders BitPay and Coinbase.\nThe goal with the LazyPay app is to make Bitcoin use a part of everyday life, increasing its volume of use in the in-person merchant market, getting more people to use digital currencies as a form of payment, rather than just as a speculative investment tool.\nTheir secure mobile wallet and user-friendly merchant app aim to make doing business in digital currencies simple and safe for both merchants and customers. The aim is to \u201cmake buying and selling goods as easy with bitcoin as it is with cash and credit cards\u2014only faster, safer and more convenient.\u201d\nThe average person needs to be able to find more places to spend bitcoin, they don\u2019t know how to obtain it, and transactions seem too complex. Lack of education among retailers and the lack of an easy-to-use, trusted merchant platform are also problems.\nLazyCoins and LazyPay are designed to fix such issues, with security at the top of their priorities. Cold storage wallets and two-factor authentication for accounts, fingerprint access for the app, and multi signature keys are just some of the many features. And a policy of crediting a merchant account on the day of their transactions, by the exact amount that the user pays, will eliminate the risk of price fluctuations.\nThey are on a mission to sign up merchants and educate them on the benefits and ease of accepting Bitcoin. The app is free, offers zero-transaction fees, daily direct payments to bank accounts and no chargebacks. LazyPay will demonstrate how credits cards are slower, riskier and more expensive in comparison. Operating the app will be intuitive for the non-tech person; easier than using a cash register or credit card point-of-sale terminal.\nOn top of all these features, the app will include a live, automatically updated map showing the locations of local Bitcoin merchants and businesses. It will offer NFC-enabled payments for super fast POS transactions, the ability to buy and sell bitcoin from the app and a direct in-app link to bank accounts. And the merchant will require no hardware and not be asked to sign contracts or make any commitments.\n\u201cWe\u2019re on a mission,\u201d says Daychopan, \u201cto spread the word and sign up as many merchants as we can. And London is our chosen starting point for this crypto-crusade\u2026 Then we can give those Silicon Valley lot a run for their (digital) money,\u201d becoming \u201ca dominant force in crypto.\u201d\nFor more information:\nblog.lazycoins.com\nwww.lazycoins.com\nwww.lazypay.co.uk\nwww.lazynews.tv", "year": 2015, "month": 1, "day": 27}

There are few investments that financial institutions can make that have the all-or-nothing security properties of a Bitcoin wallet.\nMany proponents tout the benefits of irreversible Bitcoin transactions for consumers and merchants, but at the enterprise level irreversibility can actually be quite scary. Business-to-business transactions are rarely anonymous, and the legal system provides sufficient pressure for parties to behave.\nHowever, the legal system will not be of much help if those coins disappear due to accidental destruction or an anonymous security breach. In our experience with institutions, this is a critical barrier to entry. And getting institutions involved is a critical milestone for mainstream Bitcoin adoption.\nInsurance can solve these problems, and a strong backbone of insured storage options could be a catalyst for both consumers and businesses to take Bitcoin more seriously. But getting insured is no easy task in such a new and high-stakes technology field.\nImagine you are an insurance underwriter being asked to price a policy for full coverage of a $100 million bitcoin wallet held by a company whose name you don\u2019t recognize. In your first meeting with them they claim, \u201cWe are using all the most advanced technology to store our coins!\u201d They use all the Bitcoin security buzzwords: \u201ccold storage,\u201d \u201cmulti-sig,\u201d and \u201cfragmented backups.\u201d\nWould that alone comfort you enough to risk $100 million for a small premium?\nHow do you know that they are actually using cold storage and multi-sig in their setup?\nHow do you know backups are created and secured properly (and not on Dropbox)?\nHow do you know an employee or executive did not rig the software or hardware to essentially steal the wallet before it was even created?\nCold storage and multi-sig are important concepts in Bitcoin security, but conceptual security alone is not enough. We want operationally transparent, auditable security. And it all starts with the \u201cKey Ceremony.\u201d\nKey Ceremonies are not new. They have actually been used for 20 years to ensure integrity of some of the most valuable cryptographic key material in the world. This includes keys that protect the backbone of the Internet, and keys held by governments used to issue and verify passports. Our goal at Armory has been to bring these established, high-integrity processes into the Bitcoin space. This is important in so that organizations can manage their own risk, but especially important to the insurance companies whom we believe will help enable traditional institutions to become Bitcoin holders.\nKey ceremonies are typically tailored to the organization and the value of the key material. However, in the most extreme cases, they are performed in a secure room with video cameras, witnesses, lawyers, notaries, and company executives.\nThe goal is not to only create the sensitive key material, but to reach an overwhelming consensus that they are generated in a cryptographically secure manner, and that no one could have made unauthorized copies. The process can ultimately include the following:\n\u2022 Those who ultimately manage the keys and key backups are identified, documented, and their responsibilities are made clear.\n\u2022 The authenticity of all hardware and software is verified before it is used for secure operation.\n\u2022 Tamper seals are applied to all secure devices, and tamper-evident bags are used to detect any tampering or copying of sensitive backup data after they leave the ceremony room.\n\u2022 The display of the secure computer is mirrored on large monitors for all witnesses and video cameras to observe every keystroke and mouse click during the key ceremony.\n\u2022 The videos from the ceremony are archived to be reviewed/audited by third-parties, and possibly as part of an investigation if funds go missing unexplained.\nKeep in mind, that in a cold-multisig wallet arrangement, each site will have to independently carry out its own key ceremony. In our conversations with insurance representatives, the best way to decentralize the security model is to have different independent companies managing the coins.\nThe company that owns the coins would not even have the ability to move the coins by themselves. Nor would any other company. Authorizing transactions would require other signers to get recorded video confirmation from executives with authority over the wallet, enabling traceability and auditability of the ongoing operation.\nNot all companies need this level of rigor. But a \u201cfull-paranoid\u201d solution needs to exist if Bitcoin is going to see the entrance of global corporations who would be managing billions of dollars worth of bitcoins. A strong key ceremony as outlined above is only the start of an enterprise end-to-end security solution.", "year": 2015, "month": 2, "day": 3}

That\u2019s how important Bitcoin and other digital currencies have become in recent years. And as we know, what happens in New York's financial world often has implications for the wider world. All the recent attention New York has paid to virtual currency is raising many important legal questions, with potentially profound implications. This article will offer a brief survey of just some of them.\nA Cryptic History of Money\nBitcoin is the latest and best known in a long line of digital currencies. The basic premise of digital currencies is that they try to establish a medium of exchange based on immutable mathematics, thus putting the currency beyond the control or manipulation of any government. Not long after the computer was invented people started discussing the development of currency based on that series of zeroes and ones called \u201cbits.\u201d\nBut mediums of exchange go back to the first bartering by cave people. When A and B first exchanged goods, each was getting something from the other that he wanted. Soon, there came a point when B didn\u2019t really want more apples but knew that he could exchange them with C for the tomatoes B really wanted. Soon he had an inventory waiting to be bartered. And shortly after that B needed some means of storing his accumulating wealth other than in the tomatoes and other produce he had bartered for.\nInitially, B\u2019s excess wealth might have been represented in certain beads or special rocks. Next came smelted copper and eventually gold and silver. Then there was the problem of storage for this wealth\ninventory. So here came banks and coins minted by governments, followed by the age of paper or fiat money, checks and credit cards. Today, instead of masses of paper moving through the banking system, all this transfer of wealth\u2014debiting and crediting\u2014takes place electronically.\u00a0 That means we are already in the digital currency era.\nA Few Legal Questions\nThe introduction to the original white paper by Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous founder \"Satoshi Nakamoto\" states:\n\u201cWhat is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud \u2026 . The fraud system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes.\u201d\nWhat Nakamoto could not address at the time was Bitcoin\u2019s legal status in the currency and taxation worlds. What exactly is Bitcoin for legal purposes? This is a critical question, because Bitcoin\u2019s legal characterization makes a difference as to whether it is regulated, how it is regulated, and who regulates it.\nThus far, Bitcoin has been regarded as both a currency and a commodity. In SEC v. Shavers, a federal court in Texas held that since Bitcoin could be used to buy things other than Bitcoin itself, it was money. The court found that paying in bitcoins for shares in a business run by others for profit was buying a security and subject to SEC regulation. The court did not deal with the nature of what the business was going to do with the \u201cmoney.\u201d The business intended to deal in bitcoins.\nThe court could have classified the transaction as an investment in commodities, as a Bitcoin trading business, or as trading in forex. The case presented different ways of looking at Bitcoin, along with several possible regulatory schemes: currency, securities, commodities and forex.\u00a0 All of that suggests another question: Who has legal jurisdiction over Bitcoin transactions? Suppose Company A, physically in country X, uses the Internet to find an exchange, \u201cGiveandTake,\u201d upon which it can offer its shares. It accepts payment only in Bitcoin. The exchange is only virtual and Company A does not know where the exchange is located.\nCompany A offers its securities, and investors pay for it by depositing bitcoins into Company A\u2019s electronic wallet. The wallet is administered by \u201cMaybesafe,\u201d thought to be in country Y. Company A does not have the physical name and address of \u201cMaybesafe\u201d or the investors. All it has is email addresses. Of course, the securities the investors purchase are really electronic entries. Later, Company A pays dividends to the investors by sending the dividends to their virtual wallets via their email addresses. These recipients could be anywhere in the world.\nSuppose things go wrong. Perhaps some of Nakamoto\u2019s \u201chonest nodes\u201d succumb to \u201cattacker nodes.\u201d Maybe the business simply goes bankrupt. What government(s) can take jurisdiction? To what court can the injured party go to seek justice? Where the physical offices of the various participants are located, or the location of their servers?\nThe New York Story\nNew York, Wall Street\u2019s home, has published proposed regulations defining its jurisdiction as covering any transaction \u201cinvolving New York or a New York resident.\u201d There are stated limits to \u201cinvolving,\u201d but even so, anybody in the Bitcoin business \u201cinvolving\u201d New York will have to obtain a license. The only real exclusion is for \u201cmerchants and consumers\u201d who \u201cutilize Virtual Currency solely for the purchase or sale of goods or services.\u201d\nIn the banking world, New York\u2019s highest court has ruled its courts have jurisdiction over Lebanese Canadian Bank sued by U.S., Canadian, and Israeli citizens resident in Israel who were victims of Hezbollah rocket attacks. The claim was that the bank assisted Hezbollah by \u201cfacilitating international money transactions\u201d by using its New York correspondent bank to transfer money to Hezbollah agents. This approach could be applied to Bitcoin. Beware Bitcoiners!\nIn our hypothetical case, New York\u2019s proposed regulations could require that Company A know the physical address of the exchange, that the exchange and wallet be licensed, and that all parties, including the investors, know with whom they are dealing beyond mere email addresses.\nThe proposed regulation requires all advertisements by licensees to include their name and a statement that they are licensed to engage in a \u201cVirtual Currency Business\u201d by New York. The license will serve as an advertised badge of integrity, like a bank saying it is a member of the FDIC. Hopefully, there will be no Mt. Gox or Silk Road fiascos by New York licensees.\nBut it\u2019s a tough regulation. Applicants must submit fingerprints, extensive personnel background information, certification of an outside investigator, a detailed business plan, and audited financials\u2014much like a bank.\nOnce in business, a licensee must have a written compliance plan, maintain compliance personnel, be audited, and report frequently to the regulators. Among other things, if for instance, $10,000 in bitcoin or money is transmitted in \u201cone day by one person,\u201d as in buying shares \"involving New York or any resident of New York,\" the licensees will have to report the transaction to the New York regulators.\nSome Laws That Might Apply\nThe Treasury\u2019s Financial Crime Enforcement Network (FinCEN) requires U.S. financial institutions to assist U.S. government agencies to detect and prevent money laundering and other criminal activity. Under the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, any transfer of funds, other than a transaction originated by check, or similar paper instrument, which is initiated through an electronic terminal, telephonic instrument, or computer, must be reported. \u201cMoney transmitting\u201d includes transferring funds on behalf of the public by any and all means within this country or abroad. These laws would ostensibly cover Bitcoin transactions such as the illegal drug dealings in the infamous Silk Road case.\nBitcoiners, like all businesses, will have to comply with the securities laws, privacy, tax, health, Social Security laws, and money transmitter laws, and honor their contracts\u2014or risk being sued. For Bitcoiners, regulation will greatly compromise the vaunted anonymity of the currency. This is a matter of more than a little concern for many in the Bitcoin community. Will a New York badge of integrity be worth it?\nAnd About the Rest of the World ...\nNew York isn\u2019t the only jurisdiction considering whether and how to regulate Bitcoin, but with New York being the 800-pound gorilla of the financial world that it is, you can bet that the rest of the world is watching very closely. Given Bitcoin\u2019s endurance and ever-evolving prominence on the world\u2019s financial stage, governments everywhere are considering regulation, and they will most certainly be closely observing what happens in New York.\nAs it stands now, Russia and others may criminalize Bitcoin in the future. On the other hand, they may find that tactic to be unsustainable and a bad move for their own financial system. The best advice from here is to stay tuned. Bitcoin remains an ever-evolving legal quandary.\nBitcoin Snapshot: Russia\nThe situation in Russia has many players, and has shifted ambiguously in 2014. In January, the Bank of Russia issued a statement discouraging the use of bitcoins, warning that Russians who use them risk becoming unwittingly involved in illegal activities. After a meeting with the Bank of Russia, Russia\u2019s Prosecutor General announced in February, 2014 that with the ruble being the official currency of the Russian Federation, existing Russian law categorically prohibits Bitcoin. The Bank of Russia, however, came away with a different interpretation of that meeting. In March the bank clarified that it had not concluded that all \u201ccryptocurrencies\u201d were prohibited, and that the meeting was merely intended to develop a regulatory framework to combat illegal operations and protect the rights of users.\nIt seems that the matter will be settled soon enough, though, as Russia\u2019s Finance Ministry is now backing a bill that would fine individuals involved with virtual currencies the equivalent of between $100 and $840, according to the nature of the offense. Officials and legal entities would face substantially higher fines, up to $12,500.\u00a0 While the Finance Ministry has backed off of its earlier attempts to impose more severe fines, its underlying hostility to virtual currencies remains intact.\u00a0 Its position is, however, opposed by the chair of the Duma\u2019s Committee on Financial Markets. Given Russia\u2019s well-documented ambivalence on the matter, the bill\u2019s fate remains uncertain as a vote looms soon.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0", "year": 2015, "month": 1, "day": 27}

After its public launch in the spring, the New York -based Gemini exchange, announced in January on the Winklevoss Capital website, will be a fully regulated Bitcoin exchange built on rock-solid compliance and backed by the U.S. regulatory and banking infrastructure. The Winklevoss twins discussed their plans in an interview with Vice News.\nLast month, investors including three of the world\u2019s most respected financial institutions \u2013 The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), a subsidiary of USAA, and BBVA Ventures \u2013 invested $75 million in the Bitcoin service provider Coinbase, bringing its total capital to $106 million. According to Coinbase, that was the first time financial institutions made a major investment in a Bitcoin company. Besides buying and selling Bitcoin, the Coinbase Exchange allows customers worldwide to hold and use US dollars. Therefore, as noted by David Bailey in a recent Bitcoin Magazine article, Coinbase can be considered as the first global bank, and \u201cthe AOL of Bitcoin.\u201d\nNot so fast, say the Winklevoss twins. In their opinion, Coinbase launched their exchange before completing the necessary regulatory homework. Vice News reports that regulators in New York and California haven\u2019t yet issued all the applicable licenses. Mark Williams, a finance professor at Boston University, believes that Coinbase\u2019s attempt to start business without all the required licenses was very risky. According to him, building trust with regulators is key to Bitcoin\u2019s future.\nThe Winklevoss twins believe that the main selling point of Gemini will be its strict compliance with all applicable regulations and its firm base in the US banking system \u2013 a major U.S. bank is involved, and no money will cross borders.\nAccording to a statement issued by the twins: \u201c[I]t\u2019s a U.S. home for people, where they don\u2019t have to wire their money overseas, where their money can actually stay in America, where they can buy and sell bitcoin from a company that\u2019s regulated and has consumer protections. We see this as really critical infrastructure to building bitcoin and realizing its potential. [W]e\u2019ve had open dialogue with regulators for almost a year now and we feel that we\u2019re close and we want to make sure that we truly [are] licensed, that\u2019s one of our principles. We don\u2019t want to half bake it, or hack our way through and be on the fringe of it, we really want to do this the right way and get the blessing of the regulators. And we do feel that that\u2019s around the corner.\u201d\nAn interesting issue raised by the Vice News article is the \u201csell-out\u201d of Bitcoin, which apparently is taking distance from its cypherpunk roots in underground crypto-anarchist circles and embracing Big Capital and Big Government. Is the mainstreaming of Bitcoin inevitable and necessary for its adoption by the masses? Some say the nature of the Bitcoin protocol makes it impossible to completely eliminate its potential for anonymous and untraceable transactions. Is that is the case, even in a Bitcoin economy that becomes more and more mainstream and regulated, there will always be underground pockets of unconstrained use.\nIn addition to Gemini, the Winklevosses are planning a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF, which will be available to all investors on NASDAQ with the ticker COIN. The launch date is unknown, but the twins told Inside Bitcoins that everything is proceeding according to plan.\nThey added: \u201cFor those who are up for that and want to actually buy and sell bitcoin the asset, they can do so at Gemini.com. For those that just want bitcoin asset exposure or those, like institutions, pension plans, 401(k)s, etc., that cannot invest in bitcoin themselves, their only avenue to gain bitcoin exposure will be through a structure like an ETF where they are purchasing a security and not the underlying asset itself.\u201d\nAccording to the SEC filing, the value of COIN shares will reflect the dollar exchange rate of Bitcoin on Winkdex. That will be an interesting option for those traditional investors who are persuaded that the dollar exchange rate of Bitcoin will rise in the mid- and long term, but prefer not to hold Bitcoin.\nImages via Gemini.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 2, "day": 18}

It recently published three directives:\nWarnings on use of virtual currencies (30 Jan 2015);Notice on virtual currencies (30 Jan 2015);Notice of Central Authority for Reporting on virtual currencies (2nd Feb 2015).\nThe \u201cNotice About the use of virtual currencies\u201d (published on the Supervisory Bulletin No. 1, January 2015) is a summary of guidance previously issued by the European Central Bank (ECB), the European Banking Authority (EBA), and the Financial Action Task Force. The Central Bank of Italy is the first to release any statements based on the ECB\u2019s comments. The Notice clarifies the legal status of virtual currencies in Italy with this important statement:\n\u201cIn Italy the purchase, use and acceptance of virtual currency must be considered lawful activity: the parties are free to transact in amounts not expressed in legal tender.\u201d\nThe January 30 Notice on virtual currencies also contains an analysis of the guidance published by the EBA, and agrees with the EBA\u2019s recommendation that financial institutions should avoid buying or investing in virtual currencies until a formal legal framework has been established. This means the Central Bank will not ban regulated institutions from dealing in Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, but advises them to wait until formal regulations are announced.\nThe Notice allows financial institutions regulated by the Bank of Italy to do business with any virtual currency companies, provided that they respect existing AML/KYC requirements for account holders and warn them about the risks involved.\nThe Notice of Central Authority for Reporting on virtual currencies of Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) warns that using virtual currencies may enable money laundering and terrorist financing, as previously discussed by the ECB and other European authorities. The FIU states that businesses dealing in virtual currencies, including holding them and exchanging them for fiat currencies, are not required to comply with any AML/KYC regulations.\nA reading of the documents released by both the Central Bank of Italy and the FIU indicates that a business that transacts in virtual currencies is not subject to any regulation at this time. However, the owners of such businesses would be subject to existing AML/KYC requirements when setting up a bank account or dealing with a regulated financial institution. In that case, virtual currency activities are not subject to any unique regulations; instead the activities are regulated where they intersect with the existing AML requirements of the Italian financial system.\nItaly is the first country to declare that virtual currency exchanges are not subject to any AML requirements. This is in contrast to the United States, where exchanges are required to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as Money Services Businesses.\nThe FIU concludes with a recommendation that regulated financial institutions evaluate their own clients to screen for suspicious transactions. It also recommends that financial institutions educate their staff about virtual currencies and how to identify suspicious transactions, with a particular focus on gaming operators.", "year": 2015, "month": 2, "day": 5}

Well, there\u2019s fast, and then there\u2019s Justin Boston fast. That\u2019s the kind of fast that involves driving a motorized vehicle that is not a plane up to 201 miles per hour on a race track, around which he usually averages somewhere between 173-177 miles an hour over grueling 200- or 250- mile races.\nBoston is a Maryland native and NASCAR Camping World Truck Series driver affiliated with the Kyle Busch Motorsports (KBM) group based in the racing hub of Charlotte, North Carolina. Having recently picked up his chief sponsor in BitPay, the world\u2019s leading Bitcoin payment processor, he and his BitPay logo-adorned Toyota Tundra pickup will be lining up Friday night, February 20 at the fabled Daytona International Speedway in Florida for the NextEra Energy Resources 250. The event will be carried live on Fox Sports 1 beginning at 7:30 p.m. ET.\nBoston is a personable and articulate 25-year-old who has been moving very fast on things with wheels ever since his parents gifted him with a tiny motocross bike for his fifth birthday. That innocent-seeming gesture for what they figured would be their son\u2019s occasional amusement triggered a lifelong passion that Boston has since modified but never relinquished.\n\n\u201cMy dad took to hiding the bike in the back of his truck because they couldn\u2019t get me off it,\u201d Boston remembers. \u201cIt just intrigued me and turned into something way more than my family ever dreamed it could be.\u201d\nThough his parents weren\u2019t racing fans at the time, Boston quickly got on a youth motocross circuit that involved racing weekends all over the region.\n\u201cI loved motocross and did it from the time I was 7 up till nearly 13,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes we\u2019d drive 12 or 13 hours and I\u2019d be doing my homework in the back seat. Racing always brought our family together, and there\u2019s a great community involved. It was never something I did to get away from people, but to get closer to them. And it also let me push my own boundaries.\u201d\nThose boundaries were sorely tested over the years as Boston suffered the almost inevitable nasty spills in what he describes as a \u201cgladiator sport.\u201d\nAfter covering their eyes at one too many accidents playing out in front of them, his parents asked for a family pow-wow to discuss their sub-teenage son\u2019s career choice. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t stand to see me get injured all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cI understood. But I really loved it, so I got desperate to find something else.\u201d\nAfter taking up serious wakeboarding for a time, he discovered the glories of stock car racing at age 16 after watching a NASCAR race in Delaware. That prompted enrollment in a racing school in Charlotte and the long (most always oval-shaped) roads that have taken him through various racing classes leading up to his coveted affiliation with KBM. The BitPay sponsorship and lining up for the legendary Daytona series next week followed.\n\u201cIn racing, they say, \u2018All roads lead to Daytona,\u2019\u201d Boston notes. \u201cIf you win there, you remember it the rest of your life.\u201d\nHow likely is that win? \u201cIf everyone knew how races played out, there would be no reason to race,\u201d he says, sounding as confident and intense as one would expect from someone whose parents had to hide his bike from him not all that many years ago.\nIronically to mere mortals who look at cars nearing 200 mph and can only think, \u201cDanger! Danger!\u201d, Boston sees NASCAR driving as far safer than the motocross of his youth. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a rush driving that fast, but it\u2019s a relative speed, too, because your competitors are right there doing the same. It\u2019s a very mental sport, and you train yourself to stay focused when you\u2019re tired and hot.\u201d\nTemperatures in the cockpit, he says, can run 30 degrees above ambient temperature, meaning that a balmy 80-degree Florida day can mean 110 degrees in the cockpit, where ingesting copious doses of fluids is also part of the focus drivers must keep.\n\u201cI was pretty much self-taught in stock car racing until I hooked up with my race team KBM last year,\u201d Boston says. \u201cThat really launched my career to a new level, and the good thing is, stock car racers can have long careers. It\u2019s really fun driving these things, and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what I can do.\u201d\nBoston figures to make it fun and profitable for Bitcoin enthusiasts next week by promoting the Twitter hashtag #jbossbitcoin, to which people can post thoughts, reflections, witticisms, photos, and other creative gestures of support. Winning posts will earn ChangeTips in Bitcoin from the cryptocurrency-savvy Boston Racing team.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been following digital currency for a long time now, so when I heard from BitPay a few months ago and we started discussing sponsorship possibilities, I got pretty excited,\u201d Boston says. \u201cIt\u2019s a great group, and we are going to have big fun with ChangeTip during the race. It\u2019s a very cool way of showing support for my team, and for us to show our appreciation right back.\u201d", "year": 2015, "month": 2, "day": 12}
{"title": "The Ledger Wallet Nano: Cutting-Edge Hardware Security", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/ledger-wallet-nano-cutting-edge-hardware-security-1424137098/", "birthday": "Feb 16, 2015  8:38 PM EST", "date": "2015-02-17 01:38:00", "content": "Bitcoin Magazine\nOne of the challenges of storing bitcoin securely is finding the appropriate tradeoff between security and convenience. On one end of the spectrum, hosted online wallets make it super simple to store your bitcoin online and access them from any computer by logging in with a username and password. However, this means that your account can be compromised easily by an attacker who learns your email and password. This also means that you must trust your hosted wallet provider to offer appropriate security measures.\nOn the high-security end of the spectrum, paper wallets allow you to store bitcoin completely offline, but the process of creating a paper wallet securely and spending bitcoin from your paper wallet is quite complex and can be intimidating for first time users.\nEnter the hardware wallet: the security of offline storage with the convenience of a hosted web wallet. There are two hardware wallets on the market today, the Ledger Wallet Nano and the TREZOR. At only 29 euros (~$33), the Ledger Wallet is a more affordable option than the TREZOR, which retails for $119. Both offer similar functionality; the TREZOR has more features, including a dedicated screen that accounts for the higher price, but it may appeal to a more select group of users than the basic, all-purpose Ledger.\nThe Ledger Wallet is a hardware wallet, which means that the private keys to your bitcoin address are stored in a secure chip on the wallet. This allows you to use the wallet even with a computer that may be untrusted, as your private keys cannot be extracted from the hardware wallet. This concept was made popular by the TREZOR wallet, the first bitcoin hardware wallet released.\nThe Ledger Wallet itself looks similar to a standard USB thumb drive. It comes with a recovery sheet and a security card in a black pocket.\n\nTo set up a Ledger Wallet, the first step is to visit theLedger website using the Chrome browser to launch the application. This application walks you through the setup process for the Ledger Wallet and allows you to send and receive bitcoin using the wallet.\nWhen you first open the application, you\u2019re prompted to plug the wallet into the USB drive of your computer. Once you\u2019ve plugged it in, you have the choice of either creating a new wallet or recovering an existing one. Choosing to create a new wallet begins the simple, four-step setup process.\n\n\nStep one is to confirm that the computer you\u2019re using for the setup process is secure. The setup application handles highly sensitive data about your wallet, so this configuration should only be done from a malware-free computer. For the super security conscious, this means using a fresh install of Linux on a computer without internet access. However, once you\u2019ve completed the setup process, you can use the Ledger Wallet from any computer, even an untrusted one. (Here is where a key feature of the TREZOR may appeal: it can be setup without using a computer, with no extra security precautions needed.)\nStep two is to set up a four-digit PIN code that must be entered every time you plug in your Ledger Wallet. If you enter this PIN incorrectly three times, the Ledger Wallet is wiped and you must restore it using the recovery process. This prevents anyone who gains access to your Ledger Wallet and security card from completing transactions without your PIN code.\nStep three is to simply confirm the PIN code you\u2019ve chosen during the setup process.\nAt step four, the Ledger Wallet application generates a 24-word recovery phrase and instructs you to record it on the recovery sheet. This 24-word phrase can be used to restore your Ledger Wallet, so it must be stored in a safe place apart from your wallet, like a safe deposit box. If your Ledger Wallet ever becomes lost, damaged or deleted, you can use your phrase to recover your account and bitcoin to any Ledger Wallet. This is the same recovery process that the TREZOR wallet uses.\n\n\nOnce you\u2019ve written down the recovery phrase, the Ledger Wallet setup is complete and you\u2019re ready to start sending and receiving bitcoin. Simply enter your PIN code to unlock the Ledger Wallet and you\u2019re presented with an interface that allows you to send and receive bitcoin and view your transaction history.\n\n\n\nTo receive bitcoin, you can either send a request via email or simply display your wallet address as plain text or a QR code containing your public key.\n\n\nTo send bitcoin, you can enter the recipient\u2019s bitcoin address or scan a QR code and enter the amount you\u2019d like to send. However, the Ledger Wallet adds one additional step to the sending process to confirm the intended address. The Ledger Wallet application shows the address you\u2019re sending bitcoin to, and randomly chooses four characters from the receiving address. For each character, you use the security card that came with your Ledger Wallet to look up the corresponding character, e.g. a = 0, b=9, c = 3, etc. This step is important because it ensures that you\u2019re only sending bitcoin to the address you intended, and that this address hasn\u2019t been modified by malware. The TREZOR has a dedicated screen on the hardware wallet so that you can verify the intended bitcoin address before signing the transaction. The Ledger Wallet team has stated that the next version of the Ledger Wallet will also include a screen. \nOverall, the Ledger Wallet is a great solution for users who desire a simple yet secure way to store bitcoin. The setup and use of the Ledger Wallet is simple and easy to follow, even for those new to bitcoin. It is small, easy to carry and features a very intuitive interface. The Ledger Wallet\u2019s Paris-based team says that many improvements are in the works, including features for use of multiple accounts as well as a smartphone application instead of the security card, to confirm the destination address. A second version, the Ledger Wallet Proton, which will include NFC transaction signing, is currently under development.", "year": 2015, "month": 2, "day": 17}

According to attendees, the private, limited-attendance nature of the event created a venue for open discussion and commentary.\nAccording to Bruce Fenton of the Bitcoin Association and Atlantic Financial, who organized the event with Anthony Di Iorio of Ethereum, many CEOs hold back on their commentary in public for fear of drawing the attention and ire of regulators, the media or competitors. To establish an atmosphere that would allow participants to freely explore current issues, problems and opportunities in Bitcoin, the event organizers elected to keep the event small and private.\nThe event\u2019s website list of confirmed attendees included notable Bitcoin CEOs, entrepreneurs and early adopters such as Roger Ver, Erik Voorhees, Charlie Lee, Vitalik Buterin and Nic Cary.\nHints are now being released of trending issues and prognostications that surfaced after two days of sessions:\nMining Hardware Sales Down \u2013 A tectonic shift in the economics of mining has led to a downturn in hardware sales, with one manufacturer reporting a 95 percent drop.Multisig \u2013 Industry experts predict that 2015 will be the year of mass adoptions for multisig wallets among consumers and businesses. If your product does not have multisig capabilities, it is behind the curve of progress for security measures.Mining Fees Gaining Prominence \u2013 Fees will become more prevalent as a critical component of the economic feasibility of mining, especially as the next halving approaches in early 2016.Bitcoin ATMs \u2013 Given the high hardware costs and overhead of operation, we will probably see these first coming into play under the umbrellas of the larger Bitcoin brand names who have the ability to amortize the expense.Mining End Cost Profile Shrinking \u2013 Conference attendees concluded that to be profitable, a mining enterprise now must operate with total end costs of less than nine cents per kilowatt hour. Forecast: less efficient miners fade away while the highly efficient and those with cheap power thrive.\nFor the most part, the conference was very informal, with many casual conversations and much information shared about the health and growth of individual entrepreneur\u2019s businesses.

See, for example, the unconfirmed rumors reported in a March, 2013 discussion on the Bitcointalk forum titled \u201cFedcoin: A centrally-issued alternative to peer-to-peer currencies.\u201d\nNow U.S. economists are taking it seriously.\nOn February 3, David Andolfatto, Vice President of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, wrote a blog post based on a presentation he gave at the International Workshop on P2P Financial Systems 2015. The title of the blog post is \u201cFedcoin: On the Desirability of a Government Cryptocurrency.\u201d\nAndolfatto\u2019s central thesis is that the government could solve the problems of digital economies as follows:\n\u201cImagine that the Fed, as the core developer, makes available an open-source Bitcoin-like protocol (suitably modified) called Fedcoin. The key point is this: the Fed is in the unique position to credibly fix the exchange rate between Fedcoin and the USD. [Consumers and businesses] will have all the benefits of Bitcoin \u2013 low cost, P2P transactions to anyone in the world with the appropriate wallet software and access to the internet. [I]n short, Fedcoin is essentially just like digital cash. Except in one important respect. Physical cash is still a superior technology for those who demand anonymity.\u201d\nFinextra blogger Tom Hay notes that Fedcoin contradicts the radical ideology of those Bitcoin enthusiasts who want a fully P2P economy not centrally controlled by the state. But from a government perspective it\u2019s an interesting idea, because it links the stability of fiat currency to the speed and convenience of the Bitcoin technical platform. He adds:\n\u201cEcuador has already launched a government-backed digital currency pegged to the U.S. dollar. [T]he Ecuadorian system is not based on the blockchain, and indeed Ecuador has banned Bitcoin and altcoins, but the Philippines are considering issuing a blockchain-based e-peso. The idea of digital fiat currency clearly has legs.\u201d\nSo is the rise of FedCoin inevitable?\nThe film \u201cThe Rise and Rise of Bitcoin\u201d is a fascinating recap of the rebellious history of Bitcoin since its inception in 2009 all the way to the Mt. Gox fall and the arrest of Charlie Shrem in early 2014. The film tells a typical Internet story of idealistic hackers who want to change the world and their unstoppable rise\u2026 until the big boys take notice.\nThose old enough to remember their \u201cInternet moment\u201d of enthusiastic awe for the newborn Internet in the early 90s \u2013 yes, it will change the world so fast \u2013 remember also the rest of the story: from a plaything of geeks and techno-libertarian anonymous dreamers (a famous 1993 New Yorker cartoon observed that \u201cOn the Internet, nobody knows you\u2019re a dog\u201d), the Internet quickly became a tool of Big Capital and Big Government.\nToday, old-timers use Facebook like everyone else, but know that everything we say and do online is monitored by governments and businesses all the time. We know that, short of taking pro-level privacy measures, there is no way to escape online surveillance. Today the Internet, like it or not, belongs to the establishment.\nPerhaps it\u2019s na\u00efve to think that exactly the same thing won\u2019t happen to Bitcoin.\nThe main appeal of Bitcoin for the original Libertarian and anarchist enthusiasts was the possibility of anonymous and untraceable transactions. But bitcoin transactions are traceable by-design to a bitcoin address, and anonymous only if the bitcoin address can\u2019t be traced back to a physical person.\nIn practice, bitcoin transactions are easily traceable to their originators, and that\u2019s one of the reasons governments will warm up to digital currencies. Forget using Bitcoin to escape taxes \u2013 in a state-controlled digital economy, the tax man will be able to find all your income and expenses in the blockchain.\nBitcoin transactions are faster and cheaper than traditional transactions, which is an important incentive not only for end users but for government agencies as well, as shown by the recent Bitcoin bills in Utah, New Hampshire and New York City. It seems likely that governments will try to appropriate selected aspects of digital currencies, and eliminate undesired aspects such as anonymity and volatility, to create efficient and cost-effective but fully regulated digital economies.", "year": 2015, "month": 2, "day": 19}

The second series (B) will consist of ten blocks of 3,000 bitcoin each, requiring a deposit of $150,000.\nNot all of the coin at auction were necessarily involved in some form of illegal transaction.

It often publishes related news, and has a simple infographic page to explain Bitcoin. In September 2014, CNN Money\u2019s Jose Pagliery published a book, Bitcoin: And the Future of Money, which is considered one of the best general reference books on the subject.\nNow that CNN Money readers know about Bitcoin, how can they trade XBT? So far, only one option is available: trade Bitcoin on a reputable exchange like Bitstamp or Coinbase. Soon, another option more suitable to traditional investors will be available: the Winklevoss twins\u2019 planned Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF, which will be available to all investors on NASDAQ with the ticker COIN and reflect the dollar exchange rate of bitcoin on Winkdex. That will be an interesting option for those who are persuaded that XBT will rise in the mid- and long term, but prefer not to hold bitcoin.\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that CNN Money treats Bitcoin like a stock. Today many people know Bitcoin as some kind of investment vehicle whose value goes up and down, and consider it as either a currency or a stock depending on whether they use it to trade on forex or stock exchanges.\nBut it\u2019s important to realize that Bitcoin is not a stock.\nCompany stock prices go up and down in the bulls-and-bears stock market depending on the public perception of the company. When there is good news about new products on the market or strategic acquisitions, the bulls want to buy and the price goes up. When there is bad news, the bears want to sell and the price goes down. In both cases, investors buy and sell depending on what they think will happen to the stock price. That\u2019s how the stock market works, and so far Bitcoin is no exception.\nBut while you can\u2019t buy things with Apple or Microsoft stock \u2013 no pizza costs 0.2 MSFT shares \u2013 you can buy more and more things with bitcoin, including consumer goods, iPhones, meals in restaurants, groceries in supermarkets that accept bitcoin, plane tickets and more. With Bitcoin adoption sky-rocketing among consumers and merchants alike, more and more consumers use bitcoin for purchases. Those purchases are equivalent to sell orders, and they bring the price of bitcoin down.\nTherefore, the growing enthusiasm of corporate investors and venture capitalists, who believe that Bitcoin is the next big thing and bet on next-generation Bitcoin killer apps, won\u2019t necessarily result in a rise of the XBT price. It\u2019s important that investors bear that in mind.", "year": 2015, "month": 2, "day": 20}

Since the elections, the European media has been full of reports about the financial situation in Greece, and the efforts of Tsipras and Varoufakis to renegotiate the Greek debt with European Union (EU) authorities. Rumors of a possible \u201cGrexit,\u201d the exit of Greece from the EU, keep surfacing.\nSyriza \u2013 officially known as \u201cCoalition of the Radical Left\u201d \u2013 is usually considered a political force of the left, as its formal name implies. However, Tsipras formed an \u201canti-austerity\u201d government coalition with the Independent Greeks of Panos Kammenos, a political party very much on the right. Actually, categorizing Syriza as either right or left would be inappropriate \u2013 the party is a political movement unique to the 21stcentury, beyond the old categories of right and left, with a radical and unconventional approach to contemporary political issues.\nVaroufakis , the new Greek Finance Minister, is no stranger to radical and unconventional thinking. In 2012, he became Economist-in-Residence at Valve Corporation, creators of the popular video games Half-Life, Portal and Counter-Strike. At Valve, Varoufakis researched in-game digital economies and maintained the Valve Economics blog. He praised the very informal management structure at Valve with words that one wouldn\u2019t expect from a politician of the left.\n\u201cNow read my political economy analysis of Valve\u2019s management model,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOne in which there are no bosses, no delegation, no commands, no attempt by anyone to tell someone what to do. Can useful lessons be drawn about not only Valve\u2019s inner workings but, importantly, regarding the future of the corporate world?\n\u201cI realized that this bunch of people were not just weird but also wonderful and, to boot, that what they were describing, the digital community they had facilitated into existence, was an economist\u2019s dream-come-true,\u201d Varoufakiswrote in an account of his first contact with Valve. \u201cThink of it: an economy where every action leaves a digital trail, every transaction is recorded.\u201d\nIn the Bitcoin block chain, every action leaves a digital trail and every transaction is recorded, so here Varoufakis is describing something very similar to Bitcoin as an economist\u2019s dream come true. It\u2019s therefore interesting to learn what he thinks about Bitcoin, and whether he sees something like Bitcoin \u2013 or, more likely, a state-controlled \u201cFedcoin\u201d \u2013 playing a role in the (necessarily creative) rescue of the Greek economy.\n\u201cIt is quite natural that many dream of a currency that politicians, bankers and central bankers cannot manipulate; a currency of the people by the people for the people,\u201d Varoufakis wrote in 2013. [But] there can be no de-politicized currency capable of \u2018powering\u2019 an advanced, industrial society.\u201d\nAccording to Varoufakis, Bitcoin is intrinsically deflationary and essentially a digital equivalent of gold, which can\u2019t provide solid foundational support for a modern economy. He added:\n\u201cWould it be possible to calibrate the long-term supply of bitcoin in such a way as to ameliorate for the deflationary effects described above, while tilting the balance from speculative to transactions demand for bitcoin? To do so we would need a Bitcoin Central Bank.\u201d\nWe are definitely in Fedcoin territory here. In a 2014 follow-up article titled \u201cBitcoin: A flawed currency blueprint with a potentially useful application for the Eurozone,\u201d Varoufakis keeps endorsing Fedcoin, or perhaps \u201cEurocoin.\u201d\n\u201c[T]he technology of Bitcoin, if suitably adapted, can be employed profitably in the Eurozone as a weapon against deflation and a means of providing much needed leeway to fiscally stressed Eurozone member-states,\u201d he says. He goes on to explain in detail how peripheral EU countries could create their own payment system with a Bitcoin-like algorithm to make it transparent, efficient and transactions-cost-free.\nHe concludes, \u201c[W]hile Bitcoin is too deflationary by nature to act as a widespread currency alternative to the dollar or the euro, its design can be used profitably in order to help the Eurozone\u2019s member-states create euro-denominated electronic payment systems that help them, at least in the medium term, overcome the asphyxiating deflationary pressures imposed upon them by the Eurozone\u2019s Gold Standard-like [and, indeed, Bitcoin-like] austerian design.\u201d\nWhen Varoufakis wrote these words in 2013 and 2014 he was just another economist, with a reputation perhaps slightly tainted by association with the video-gaming industry. But now he is the Finance Minister of a nation forced to consider new solutions to heal its collapsing economy, and in possession of considerable negotiating power with the EU authorities that wish to avoid the prospect of \u201cGrexit.\u201d It will be interesting to keep watching.\nImage of Varoufakis via Wikimedia Commons.", "year": 2015, "month": 2, "day": 22}

You can send a deposit to your new wallet, and send bitcoin to other Telegram users or any external Bitcoin address with a simple text message to Telebit. See the Telebit website for a list of Telebit commands, or send the query \u201chelp\u201d via Telegram.\nLike other online wallets, Telebit wallets are stored in the cloud, so it\u2019s not recommended that you use Telebit for receiving or storing large sums. Rather, Telebit is a portable wallet that you can carry on your smartphone and load with the bitcoin that you expect to spend in the short term \u2013 just like cash in a physical wallet.\nWhat happens if you didn\u2019t put enough money in your Telebit wallet this morning, and now you don\u2019t have enough to buy a beer? Just ask a friend on Telegram to send you some bitcoin.\nBitcoin transfers to other Telebit accounts are instantly processed off-chain with no transaction fees. Transfers to an external Bitcoin address, to be processed by the block chain, can be initiated with a text command. Users can set a limit to the amount of bitcoin they wish to hold in a Telebit wallet, and automatically forward overflows to an external Bitcoin address.\nTelebit is the brainchild of Eric Goforth and Jonathan Harrison. A couple of weeks ago the latter left his previous venture SatoshiPoint to \u201cconcentrate on [his] stealth btc project.\u201d\nTelebit has could be a game changer. The recent history of the Internet shows that momentous things begin to happen when online services reach a critical degree of simple usability, and Telebit makes handling bitcoin as simple as sending a text message.\nNow imagine a hypothetical service similar to Telebit but built on Whatsapp, owned by Facbook, which has more than 600 million users and could eventually be integrated with Facebook\u2019s messaging system. That would be a real game-changer: all Facebook users would have a Bitcoin wallet and easy one-click access to bitcoin transactions.\nTelegram is not as popular as Whatsapp \u2013 yet. But it is growing very fast, and it seems a prime target for acquisition by a major Internet company.

No more QR codes.\nThis is made possible by Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).When compared to Classic Bluetooth, the newer BLE uses less power and lowers costs while providing a similar communication range.But not everyone uses iPhones.The latest android software update (Android 5.0), however, has BLE capabilities. As a result, Airbitz has recently launched wireless Bitcoin payments for Android. The Airbitz protocol is compatible between iPhone and Android devices.The idea for wireless Bitcoin payments emerged out of dissatisfaction with the QR code method of transacting with Bitcoin.\nPaul Puey, CEO of Airbitz, explained:\"The idea came about after many frustrating experiences with QR codes, and the realization that most people are not familiar with them and their scary appearance. The advance of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which can work without pairing, gave us the motivation to develop this feature and protocol.\"\"Android was far more difficult to implement than iPhone,\" adds Paul. \"Our usage of BLE requires a mode called Peripheral Mode, which allows a device to behave like a beacon, broadcasting info to receiving devices. iPhone has had this capability since the iPhone 4S, allowing it to both broadcast and receive BLE payment requests. Android only introduced this Bluetooth feature (Peripheral Mode) as of version 5.0 (Android Lollipop).\u00a0\nWe developed the early beta versions of 5.0 with the expectation that old devices would support this feature. Before release, at the last minute, Google disabled Peripheral Mode for all devices except Nexus 6 & 9. Although a bit crippled by Google, the Airbitz wallet allows full send and receive via Bluetooth on Nexus 6 & 9, but only sending capabilities on most Android 4.3 devices and higher.\n\"Ultimately, this initiative is a move toward making Bitcoin user-friendly, something that the cryptocurrency will need if it hopes to thrive.\"Our focus,\" concludes Paul, \" is to deliver software with an amazing user experience, both visually and functionally, simplifying this advanced technology and delivering it to the masses while still retaining Bitcoin\u2019s core principles of decentralization and privacy.\"This important innovation can potentially make the process of adopting Bitcoin less like pulling out molars, and more like learning how to tweet.Check out Airbitz\u2019s website here.", "year": 2015, "month": 2, "day": 20}

One such double standard is the harsh way in which economists and commentators criticize Bitcoin technology, while at the same time taking for granted the financial system that they live under every day.\nYes, the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is very volatile still, and the ecosystem that develops around them has been a Wild West so far. But in the six years of Bitcoin\u2019s existence, the underlying technology\u2014decentralized and open source in nature\u2014has proven itself to be extremely robust and constantly evolving. Bad computer code is replaced over time by good code (or at least by a stable workaround), and likewise, bad companies are forced by the market to make way for better ones. Creative destruction rules the cloud.\nThe same things cannot be said about the fiat currency system. Banks and central banks are still running old cranky software, with systems that sometimes haven\u2019t been updated since the 1960s. Vital parts of the service and technology is centralized and therefore frozen in time, in a spiderweb of ever-expanding bureaucratic rules.

According to a study of 775 fiat currencies, there is no historical record of any that have held their value:\n\u201cTwenty percent failed through hyperinflation, 21% were destroyed by war, 12% destroyed by independence, 24% were monetarily reformed, and 23% are still in circulation approaching one of the other outcomes...The average lifespan of a fiat currency is 27 years.\u201d[1]\nThe post gold standard U.S. dollar is no exception. Despite being 44 years of age, which makes it a true veteran of the fiat space, it has lost 97% of its value since inception.[2]\nAnd that is just touching the surface of the kind of problems the fiat system produces. As we\u2019ll see in a moment, debt levels, certainly not a sign of economic health, are higher than ever before in history. Inflation is also on the rise in many nations\u2014melting away people\u2019s savings and pushing them into the arms of speculative money managers. And central banks around the world are preparing for bank holidays and bank defaults.\nWhen a system is virtually frozen in time and changes only for the worse, it is fair to say that it is broken, and that it needs replacing. That is exactly the state of the financial system today.\nNow, over to the nitty gritty. Let\u2019s crunch some numbers to see how big the problems really are.\nThe Biggest Debt Crisis in History\nIn 2008 we saw a ferocious banking crisis, the worst since the crash of 1929. In response, central banks around the world, including those of the U.S., China, and Europe, printed unprecedented amounts of money to shore up the banking system, and governments wrote out bailout subsidies like never before.\nIn Europe, for example, governments committed 1.3 trillion euros[3] to prevent the eurobanks from failing. This led to the 2011 sovereign debt crisis, which was was barely contained by the ECB. It scrambled to put together another 500 billion euro bailout program.\nWhat have all these programs, with a combined value of at least $9 trillion, really achieved?\n\u00a0Well, since 2008, \u201cleverage\u201d in the system has dropped from 25:1 to 20:1. This means that for every $20 a bank owes to customers or other banks, it has $1 in hard cash in its own possession. To adequately convey the absurdity of these numbers, an average non-financial corporation in the emerging world (not known for prudent risk management) has a leverage ratio of less than 3:1.[4] In other words, without a central bank as a backstop, most multi-national banks would have been long bankrupt.[5]\nGiven the avalanche of bailouts and stimulus programs unleashed since the 2008 crisis, government debt in the developed world has now risen to a record level 111% of GDP.\n\nLet\u2019s also not forget the extremely high private debt everywhere, now at 129% of GDP in the world, and at 300% of GDP in the United States.\n\nWith all this data, it should be no surprise that the BIS estimates the size of the total debt securities market at $100 trillion. That is about $40,000 for every person in the world who has a bank account.[6]\nThe only way for countries to accumulate so much debt is for them to print money indefinitely, and to continuously drop interest rates. And indeed, interest rates are the lowest they have been since the Middle Ages.\n\nFrom the 1700s onwards, leading western nations borrowed at rates between 3%-7%, whereas recently we saw a drop in interest rates down to below 1% in the U.S. The rates are a little above 1% now, but German 10-year bonds are trading with interest rates as low as 0.5%. This trend is unprecedented in world history.\nGovernments, banks, and households borrowing from institutions that can create money out of thin air leads, of course, to inflation.\nIllustrating this is an inflation world map that I made in May 2013:\n\nHere is the updated January 2015 version:\n\nNow, one could argue that this just shows the dollar\u2019s strength rather than actual inflation, but consider that the U.S. dollar still is the world\u2019s reserve currency, and the most important way for foreign central banks to defend the value of their currency is to buy back their own currency from whomever offers them U.S. dollars.\nThat said, the long-term value of the U.S. dollar is highly questionable. Since the U.S. went off the gold standard in 1971, central banks have been increasingly diversifying their reserves, as shown below.\n\nWhereas in the 1970s central banks had no problem with holding up to 65% in U.S. dollars, that amount has now declined to 40%-45%. That certainly doesn\u2019t signal a vote of confidence in the greenback.\nNational central banks are also increasingly moving physical gold back within their own jurisdiction. We\u2019ve seen both Germany and the Netherlands repatriate 120 tons each, as well as Poland, Venezuela, Ecuador, Mexico, Switzerland and others participating in the \u201cgold repatriation movement.\u201d It is no coincidence that this movement started in 2011 at the time of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe; governments are afraid of defaults, devaluations, and/or hyperinflation, and want to prepare for the launch of a new currency.\nSeeking \u201cStability\u201d\nTake a moment to absorb how gargantuan the problems of the financial system have become.\nNow consider this: central bankers often contradict each other and themselves, but one thing they unilaterally stand for is \u201cstability.\u201d The U.S. Federal Reserve, for example, says its goal is \u201ca more stable monetary and financial system.\u201d[7] Its European counterpart, the ECB, has as its mission statement \u201cto maintain price stability and to safeguard the value of the euro.\u201d[8]\nWhere is this \u201cstability\u201d central bankers keep talking about? How can we believe in a system that achieves exactly the opposite of that which its leaders proclaim?\nOver the last 10 years, central banks have created new money to the tune of $14 trillion, and that amount is still growing. Just this week, the ECB announced that over the next 18 months it will pump another \u20ac1.1 trillion into the eurosystem.\n\u00a0\nHere is what Gideon Gono, Zimbabwean central banker and father of the $100 trillion bill, has to say about the newfangled post-2008 financial paradigm:\n\u201cI've been condemned by traditional economists who said that printing money is responsible for inflation. Out of the necessity to exist, to ensure my people survive, I had to find myself printing money. I found myself doing extraordinary things that aren't in the textbooks. Then the IMF asked the U.S. to please print money. I began to see the whole world now in a mode of practicing what they have been saying I should not. I decided that God had been on my side and had come to vindicate me.\u201d[9]\n\u00a0Gono is right: his example is being followed by every prestigious central bank in the world. And when journalists dare to mention the elephant in the room, they are scoffed at. In fact, this happened just this week, when ECB chairman Mario Draghi was asked whether his policy of money printing would lead to hyperinflation. He dryly responded that despite the massive stimulus programs, \u201cSomehow this runaway inflation hasn't come yet\u201d.[10]\n\u00a0In 2008 it became clear that the emperor had no clothes. By now, it should be clear that his entire court is also threadless.\nConclusion\nI will keep my opinion about what all these financial omens forebode for another time, but it should be clear by now that the fiat system is anything but stable.\nIn fact, the stability in our financial system only exists to the extent that people believe in it. It is a mirage much like Bernie Madoff\u2019s \u201cempire\u201d was: as soon as enough people withdraw, it will come tumbling down.\nA new crisis is brewing in the system, as has happened every 40 years since governments started monopolizing the industry of money and banking. But this time truly is different. For the first time in history, the people have access to a decentralized, open source and globally accessible backup financial system.\nThere may be some problems that arise when Bitcoin technology is scaled up for millions, and then hundreds of millions of users. No doubt there is angst and volatility ahead, and for all we know the Bitcoin network will fail and some other cryptocurrency will take over. But there is no way this ingenious technology is going back into the bottle.\nWe now have access to a protocol that allows for honest global banking with or without intermediaries.\u00a0For those eager to divest from a financial system of falling cards, I highly recommend drawing from an alternative deck: the exciting world of cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n[1] http://www.resourceinvestor.com/News/2011/1/Pages/IsThisTimeDifferentfortheDollar.aspx\n\n\n[2] Since 1971, the dollar depreciated by 97% against gold, and by 83% against the consumer price index. \n\n\n[3] http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=abDNqy86viis&refer=home\n\n\n[4] http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1409f.pdf, pp. 39. \n\n\n[5] Measured by the Tier 1 / Total exposure ratio, see here: http://www.bis.org/publ/work471.pdf\n\n\n[6] http://datatopics.worldbank.org/financialinclusion/. \n\n\n[7] http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/mission.htm\n\n\n[8] https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/escb/html/mission_eurosys.en.html\n\n\n[9] http://fofoa.blogspot.mx/2009_01_01_archive.html\n\n\n[10] http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-01-22/what-mario-draghi-said-when-asked-if-his-action-will-unleash-hyperinflation\nPhoto:\u00a0www.planetofsuccess.com/blog/\n", "year": 2015, "month": 1, "day": 23}

Bitcoin Magazine has been there covering the highs and lows of the Bitcoin revolution, and to many of us it provided our first exposure to the future of money. More than anything, Bitcoin Magazine has been a resource and voice for the Bitcoin community at large--representing the most diverse groups of individuals in commerce today.However, as Bitcoin has grown from a nascent technology to a financial juggernaut, the magazine has faced challenges scaling itself to the ever-increasing needs of its core community, not to mention its expanding rings of interested parties, newcomers and participating enterprises.\nThe Bitcoin world is exploding, and Bitcoin Magazine is taking off right along\u00a0with it. New opportunities and demands for news, features, data, analysis,\u00a0products and services arise almost daily.With this challenge in mind, BTC Media LLC, publishers of yBitcoin (the magazine that brings Bitcoin to Main Street) recently acquired Bitcoin Magazine and\u00a0brought this esteemed publication into the BTC Media family with open arms.\u00a0As a strong, united and complete voice and face of Bitcoin, we are forging a new vision that honors Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s role while encouraging the organization to meet its full potential.We envision a Bitcoin Magazine that not only gives the community at large a very loud voice, but also delivers the quality and quantity of content needed to stay educated on every new development.\u00a0\nWe\u2019re going to be investing heavily in Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s infrastructure and team to bring you exclusive scoops, breaking news, investigative reports, quantitative data, analysis from leading Bitcoin experts and a look behind the curtain of not only the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency, but the fintech space in general.So watch this space!

{"title": "What is Bitcoin?", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-1421368023/", "birthday": "Jan 15, 2015  7:27 PM EST", "date": "2015-01-16 00:27:00", "content": "Bitcoin has taken the world by storm. Yet when most people hear about it, whether for the first or the tenth time, they have one simple question: \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\nLike an automobile, Bitcoin is very technically advanced, and it can be extremely complicated, depending on how much you want to know about it. But also like an automobile, you don\u2019t actually need to know much about Bitcoin\u2019s technical details in order to use it\u2014and in order for it to change the way you look at the world.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know. Generally speaking, Bitcoin is two things:\nA payment network (\u201cBitcoin\u201d);The currency unit used on that network (\u201cbitcoins\u201d).\nThus, as both a payment network and the specific currency used on that network, you use \u201cBitcoin\u201d to receive and send \u201cbitcoins\u201d to and from other people.\n\u201cThe real magic of Bitcoin, the reason it\u2019s so newsworthy, comes from the consequences of its existence.\u201d\nTo clarify this, consider a comparison to items with which you\u2019re already familiar: PayPal and U.S. dollars. PayPal is a payment network, but not a currency. On the flip side, the U.S. dollar is a currency, butnot a payment network. You use the PayPal payment network to make transactions in U.S. dollar currency with people.\nNow, note that the PayPal payment network is operated and centrally controlled by one company (PayPal Inc.), and the U.S. dollar is created and centrally controlled by one organization (the U.S. federal government).\nHere\u2019s where things get important, and revolutionary\u2014and a little weird.\nWith Bitcoin, the payment network is decentralized. It is not controlled by any company or organization.\nThink of it like filesharing\u2014a network of computers that talk to each other, but nobody controls the network itself (there is no central server). The currency unit, called bitcoins, is also not created or controlled by any central party. Bitcoins are created by the network itself over time, in a somewhat random process that distributes the new coins to those computers that are supporting and operating the network. The number of coins created in this way is limited by a clever mathematical system. As of this writing, there are roughly 12 million bitcoins in existence, and this will continually increase over time to a maximum of 21 million bitcoins many years in the future.\nUnless you care about how Bitcoin accomplishes this, the above is really all you need to answer the question, \u201cWhat is Bitcoin?\u201d Answer: It\u2019s a payment network, and a currency used on that network, which are controlled by no central party. The number of bitcoins in existence is limited by mathematics.\nPerhaps the more important question, of course, is, \u201cWhy should you care?\u201d\nWhile computer engineers and mathematicians might find Bitcoin\u2019s technical details fascinating, most people don\u2019t really care about that.\nAnd while it\u2019s true that Bitcoin permits financial transactions that have essentially zero cost, and which occur instantly any- where in the world, these consumer benefits are not really what\u2019s important, either.\nThe real magic of Bitcoin, the reason it\u2019s so newsworthy, comes from the consequences of its existence.\nThe fact that Bitcoin is decentralized, with no controlling entity, has fundamental implications. Because there is no central control, the power of the currency and its payment network belong to the people who use it. And this power is tremendous indeed.\nBitcoin enables any two people, anywhere on earth, to transact with each other freely. They cannot be censored. There are no rules for their exchange except those they set between themselves.\nWith Bitcoin, there is no third party watching over the participants of economic activity, approving their conduct and charging a fee for doing so. With Bitcoin, one does not need permission to direct one\u2019s own financial life. This means people can contribute to controversial causes they believe are important, with no government agency or financial company able to cut off the payment flow. It means an entrepreneurial child can start an Internet business before he or she is 18. It means a rural African farmer can receive payment for crops from a neighboring city, even with no bank account. It means a citizen of a tyrannical nation can hide his financial assets from seizure.\nBitcoin means that for the first time in history, every person has financial sovereignty. Private property can now truly be controlled by the owner, and nobody else. The rules of finance, and our economic relationships, now become set and regulated by markets instead of by politicians. By the individual, not the collec- tive. The value of one\u2019s savings now cannot be reduced through monetary debasement (i.e. inflation). Trade between individuals is now the business of only those individuals.\nCertainly, some of these implications are controversial. Indeed, they will have profound consequences on human society, just as do all great technological achievements. A good way to think of it is that Bitcoin represents the separation of money and state\u2014the ability to \u201cpractice one\u2019s own economic behavior\u201d without the permission of anyone else. It removes the power over money from governments and banks, putting it in the hands of anyone who learns how to use it. It brings privacy in an age of surveillance, and honesty in an age of manipulation.\nSo what is Bitcoin? It is an experiment. It is a project that, if successful, will change the economic relationship between humans on a fundamental level. Its implications have just barely been explored.\nLike any experiment, it can fail, but the genie is now out of the bottle. While this genie goes about its business, many things you take for granted will likely change, so it may be wise for you to educate yourself on the technological, mathematical, and economic phenomenon that is Bitcoin.\n\nOriginally published in yBitcoin Magazine.\n", "year": 2015, "month": 1, "day": 16}
{"title": "Why Bitcoin Has Value", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-value-1421367748/", "birthday": "Jan 15, 2015  7:22 PM EST", "date": "2015-01-16 00:22:00", "content": "We all have what feels like an intrinsic understanding of value, though it is actually learned as we come to know our world. A gold bar has value, an empty soda can, not so much. When we encounter new things it\u2019s usually fairly easy to assess what kind of value they might hold, but Bitcoin is a different beast. Bitcoin is harder to define and understand, and for many beginning Bitcoiners the question of value is one of the most puzzling. So why does Bitcoin have value?\nTo begin, we really need to understand why anything has value. Fans of post-apocalyptic fiction will often point out that in the end, the only things of real value are those that sustain and defend life. Perhaps they\u2019re right on one level, but with the rise of civilized societies things got a bit more complex, because the things that sustain and defend those societies also gain a certain degree of value. It is in this context that all moneys, Bitcoin included, gain their value. Since our societies rely heavily on trade and commerce, anything that facilitates the exchange of goods and services has some degree of value.\nFrom Barter to Money\nImagine, for example, a pre-money marketplace where the barter system is king. Perhaps you\u2019re a fisherman coming to mar- ket with the day\u2019s catch and you\u2019re looking to go home with some eggs. Unfortunately for you, the chicken farmer has no use for fish at the moment, so you need to arrange a complex series of exchanges to end up with something the egg seller actually wants. You\u2019ll probably lose a percentage of your fish\u2019s value with each trade, and you also must know the exchange rate of everything with respect to everything else. What a mess.\nThis is where money saves the day. By agreeing on one interme- diate commodity, say, silver coins, two is the maximum number of exchanges anyone has to make. And there\u2019s only one exchange rate for every other commodity that matters: its cost in silver coins.\nIn truth there is more complexity involved\u2014some things, like your fish, would make very poor money indeed. Fish don\u2019t stay good for very long, they\u2019re not particularly divisible, and depending on the exchange rate, you might have to carry a truly absurd amount of them to make your day\u2019s purchases.\nOn the other hand, silver coins have their inherent problems too, when traded on extremely large or extremely small scales. This is what is truly valuable about Bitcoin: It\u2019s better money.\nThe Evolution to Bitcoin\nIt\u2019s been a long time since those first \u201chard\u201d moneys were developed, and today we transact primarily with digital representations of paper currency. We imagine bank vaults filled with stacks of cash, but that\u2019s almost never the case these days\u2014 most money exists merely as numbers in a database. There\u2019s nothing wrong with this type of system, either; it works fantastically well in an age where physical presence during a transaction is not a given. The problem is that the system is aging and far too often plagued by incompetence or greed.\nEvery IT guy knows that from time to time you have to take a drastic step: throw the old system in the trash and build a new one from scratch. Old systems, such as our current monetary system, have been patched so many times they are no longer functioning as efficiently as they should.\nWe previously patched our problems with gold and silver by introducing paper banknotes. We patched further problems by removing the precious metal backing those banknotes, then patched them again and again to allow wire transfers, credit cards, debit cards, direct deposit and online billpay. All the cornerstones of modern life are just patches on this ancient system.\nBut what would you do if you had the chance to start over? What if you could make purely digital money based on modern technologies to solve modern needs? What if we didn\u2019t need those dusty old systems or the people making absurd profits maintaining them? This is Bitcoin.\nReplacement, Not Repair\nBitcoin isn\u2019t another patch, another layer of abstraction added on top of an aging and over-complex system. Bitcoin isn\u2019t another bank or payment processor coming up with new ways to move old dollars. Bitcoin is instead a simple, elegant and modern replacement for the entire concept of money. It has value for exactly the same reason as the paper money in your wallet: It simplifies the exchange of goods and services, not in the antique setting of a barter system bazaar, but in the current setting of modern Internet-enabled life.\n\u201cBut that\u2019s only why it\u2019s useful,\u201d I hear some of you saying. \u201cWhy does it actually have value?\u201d The two-word answer is one most economists are familiar with: Network effect. The network effect is a lovely piece of jargon that refers to the quite commonsense statement that networked products and services tend to have more value when more people use them. The most common example is the telephone: During its early days when few people had access to telephones their utility, and therefore their value, were minimal. Today practically everyone has a phone, so their utility and value is so high as to be unquestionable. In this way the value of Bitcoin is directly tied to the number of its users and the frequency of their use.\nOf course Bitcoin\u2019s value stemming from the network effect is not without its own unique difficulties. When the network is still relatively small, each new group\u2019s entry or egress can create massive price fluctuations, resulting in huge profits for early adopters. Unfortunately, this makes Bitcoin look, on the surface, too good to be true\u2014a bit like a Ponzi or pyramid scheme.\nPonzis and pyramids are distinct and different forms of fraud, but they share one thing in common: The first ones in make a lot of money while the last ones in foot the bill. Both feature initial \u201cinvestors\u201d being paid out directly from new investors\u2019 money. The return is always too good to be true and the gains (for those who actually get gains) are exponential.\nBecause Bitcoin\u2019s value has risen so dramatically since its 2011 debut, it seems to fit this sort of a profile at first glance, but then so does every new technology. It\u2019s just not normally the case that we get to invest in this sort of technology and profit as it\u2019s adopted. Imagine being able to invest in the concept of email back in 1965 when some clever hacker at MIT found a way to use primitive multi-user computer systems to pass messages. It might have seemed like a silly waste then, but owning even a tiny percentage of the rights to email today would make one wealthy beyond imagining.\nTechnologies follow a known adoption curve, which tends to include a period of exponential rise. Bitcoin is no exception. Ponzis and pyramids both create value for their oldest investors by stealing from the new. There\u2019s no economics involved\u2014just theft.\nBitcoin creates value for the old investors and the new by splitting a finite currency supply more ways.

And yet, most of the actual services and businesses built within the Bitcoin ecosystem are centralized. They are run by specific people, in specific locations, with specific computer systems, and they are susceptible to specific legal entanglements.\nThis situation creates tension and certainly a little irony\u2014we have a decentralized technology, yet most things existing upon it are centralized. \nTo a casual observer, and even more to a cynical one, it may appear that the claim of Bitcoin's decentralization is a myth\u2014an overstated feature conjured up as a bullet point in Bitcoin's marketing brochure, but suspiciously not apparent in the actual product. \nConsider the structure of CoinBase, which is arguably the most successful Bitcoin wallet and payment service in existence. There is nothing decentralized about it.\nConsider CoinBase's internal policies\u2014they resemble PayPal\u2019s, not the distributed utopia Bitcoiners imagine. Coinbase wants to know who you are. They want to know what you're doing with your money, and they'll block you if they disapprove. They spy on you and control you as much as any traditional financial institution (and to be fair, it's not really their fault\u2014enforcers with guns will throw them in a cage if they don't do these things; it occurs under duress). \nSo the question arises: How can Bitcoiners claim decentralization when the premier Bitcoin service has essentially become a bank itself?\nCritics point to centralized exchanges, wallets, and payment processors to condemn Bitcoin's claims of decentralization. When Mt. Gox exploded, losing half a billion dollars of customer money, critics expressed immense skepticism that Bitcoin was really anything unique at all\u2014to them, it looked like just another new medium by which people are spied on at best, and ripped off, scammed, and defrauded at worst.\nSo isn't Bitcoin's claim of decentralization a lie?\nNo.\nAnd here's why: to understand Bitcoin one must understand the difference between coercive centralization and market-based centralization. Bitcoin possesses the latter, but avoids the former, and that is a crucial distinction.\nCoercive centralization is what we all experience in the legacy financial industry. The world's monetary system, based upon national fiat currencies created and managed by government-sponsored central banks, is coercive. It is coercive because the entities with the power over money's creation, regulation, and transfer have the will and the power to hurt you if you disobey. Not only that, but you are coerced into it in the first place, being forced to pay taxes and settle debts using only your government's anointed currency. \nIf you\u2019d like to experience the coercion first-hand, try creating some dollars, and you will find yourself thrown in prison, your property taken from you. Or try transferring dollars in any way that is \u201cunauthorized.\u201d Then you will see what coercion means. \nThe entire financial system as it exists today rests upon this anti-market model of coercion\u2014money moves only with the permission of those in control, and they're not in control by mutual contract, but by the privilege of violence. The various poisons such coercion bestows upon society are a topic for another essay, but the only reason people suffer this system is because it's been the only game in town.\nMarket-based centralization is fundamentally different. Its key feature is the ability to opt out.\nYes, CoinBase is a centralized entity. But you needn't use CoinBase to use Bitcoin. Yes, a Bitcoin exchange or web wallet is centralized, but you can always trade coins with a friend directly over the blockchain, or store it in a local wallet, without the permission of any third party. \nA user of fiat is always forced to utilize a centralized service. A user of Bitcoin is never forced to utilize a centralized service. This is the key distinction between centralization found in Bitcoin (which is market-based) and centralization found in the traditional banking industry (which is coercive). \nAnd this ability to opt out, while it may seem modest, enables wonderful things to happen, for the discipline of the marketplace can be realized. Consider: since every CoinBase user can opt out and leave the platform, this presents a natural check on CoinBase's ability to act with impropriety, and makes coercion impossible. Compare this to the model of a bank, which is able to burden its customers to a far more significant degree because it knows that if the customers want to participate in a meaningful way in the financial system, they have to use a bank and its associated fiat currency system. \nIt should thus be clear that Bitcoin enables users to withdraw into the neutral pasture of decentralized finance at any time, which means that any centralized service within the sphere exists only at the pleasure of its customers.\nAnd thus the forms of market-based centralization found within Bitcoinland needn't be feared or condemned as one would the coercive centralization of the legacy financial system. What we have is indeed something fundamentally different, which is wholly compatible with the free-market structure and intent of Bitcoin's genesis. Indeed, a free market will inevitably lead to some points of market-based centralization when economic efficiencies can be found. Every voluntary organization of people or resources is market-based centralization, and by definition, there's an inability to coerce those who partake.\nThe key to judging the legitimacy of centralization is always the ability of users to opt out. Bitcoin provides this, while fiat and central banks do not. \nThat is the difference, and it is one that the world will soon come to appreciate.", "year": 2015, "month": 1, "day": 22}
