Here\u2019s some bitcoins.\u201d\nThat short email was where it all started. Some stranger was sending me some bitcoin because he liked my routine aboutfiat currency.\nIt was a short stand-up piece that I\u2019d performed on an Australian TV show and then posted on YouTube. I bashed fiat pretty hard and it must\u2019ve hit a chord because I got quite a few emails.\nOne of them was from this guy sending me bitcoins\u2026\nI was vaguely aware of Bitcoin, but didn\u2019t really know too much about it.\nBut now someone was offering me some of this strange new currency I started getting curious.\nClicking on the link in the email took me to coinapult. This guy was sending me 0.007 of a Bitcoin, which at the time was about $2. Eventually I figured out how to set up a wallet and accept this small change.\nI\u2019m not sure if it was the process of figuring out how to set up a wallet, or the fact I now owned a bitcoin (well, 0.007 of one), but from that point on\u2026\nI had bitcoin fever. Bad.\nOver the next few months I read everything about bitcoin I could find.\nAll the problems I hated about fiat currency bitcoin solved: private, practically no transaction fees, no government or bank interference \u2013 it was all so perfect.\nI knew I had to do a stand-up routine on bitcoin.\nIf you\u2019re not a comedian that might seem like a strange thought, but all my best routines have been on topics I\u2019m passionate about.\nWriting a stand-up routine about decentralized cryptocurrency wouldn\u2019t be easy, but I thought if I could figure it out it might be a really great routine.\nI also realised something else\u2026\nEven though I\u2019d spent hours researching bitcoin and watching bitcoin related YouTube clips for days I\u2019d never seen a stand-up bit about it.\nStephen Colbert had done a pretty funny report on bitcoin and in a Q&A Josh Blue had said mining bitcoin was a hobby, but as far as I could tell nobody had done what I was trying to do.\nWas that because bitcoin is still so new and I was the first to get to the topic?\nOr was it because it\u2019s such a complex topic that \u201cwriting a funny Bitcoin stand-up routine is impossible?\nI perform regularly on an Australian community TV show (it\u2019s called Live on Bowen. Imagine a low budget Letterman).\nI realised if I came up with some jokes and performed it on the show, I\u2019d be the first comedian to ever do a bitcoin stand-up routine (on TV at least).\n\u201cI have to do a segment on Bitcoin.\u201d\nEvery Monday the writers and I meet up to plan out the segments for the show. When I walked in and said that things got weird.\nUsually one of us pitches a topic, say \u201ciphones\u201d, and the writers will throw out jokes and ideas for the next fifteen minutes.\nNot this time.\n\u201cWhat the hell is a bitcoin?\u201d someone asked.\nWe spent the next forty minutes discussing cryptocurrencies, mining and who Satoshi Nakamoto is.\nI think I gave them a good education on what Bitcoin is, but we didn\u2019t come up with any jokes.\nThese are writers who regularly come up with sketches along the lines of \u201cWhat if the president of France was a watermelon?\u201d but getting their heads around a decentralised cryptocurrency was too much.\nMaybe writing a comedy routine about bitcoin was impossible\u2026\nIf I couldn\u2019t get the writers to understand Bitcoin in a forty minute meeting, how could I explain it to an audience in a three minute TV spot?\nStill, I had about three weeks to come up with a routine about bitcoin and I wasn\u2019t about to quit now\u2026\nThe race was on\u2026\nI started writing jokes about bitcoin and performing them at comedy clubs. At first I got a lot of blank stares.\nImagine explaining Bitcoin to your parents. Now imagine they\u2019re drunk and expect you to be funny.\nOther comedians suggested I drop the routine, which is crazy because comedians are a pretty forgiving bunch.\nIf I was trying to develop a routine about Hitler they would\u2019ve told me to keep trying, but one joke about SHA256 dies and they\u2019re telling me to give up.\nIn the end this doubt was what pushed me to keep going. Now I had to prove to them (and myself) that I could write a routine about bitcoin.\nBitcoin became my Moby Dick.\nI kept performing the routine, rewriting it and performing it again.\nI\u2019d go home after shows to read bitcoin blogs in the hope that I\u2019d pick up just one little angle that could help me improve this routine.\nI also kept looking for any other comedians doing bitcoin routines. It looked like nobody was.\nApart from a few memes, and some fairly amateur sketches, I couldn\u2019t find any bitcoin comedy.\nI just prayed another comedian wouldn\u2019t come up with a bitcoin routine first\u2026\nThen as the day when I\u2019d have to perform the routine on TV drew closer, another thought hit me\u2026\nI\u2019d rewritten the routine about a hundred times by then and it was getting laughs at comedy clubs, but those audiences didn\u2019t know about bitcoin.\nHow could I be sure the stuff I was saying in the routine was factually correct?\nIf only there were some experts I could test my stuff on\u2026\nThen, the day before the taping of the show, I was browsing meetup.com and saw there was a Melbourne Bitcoiner\u2019s group.\nThey were meeting that night!\nIt was like a sign from God.\nI shot the organiser an email \u201cHi, Can I come perform a stand-up comedy routine about Bitcoin at your meeting?\u201d\nI was fully prepared for them to write back asking if this was a prank, but instead I got a reply saying they\u2019d let me give it a shot.\nThat night, after a fairly heated discussion about alt coins, Asher Tan (CoinJar co-founder and organiser of the Melbourne Bitcoin meetup) handed me the mic.\n\u201cI hope you know what you\u2019re doing\u2026\u201d he said.\n\u201cMe too!\u201d I thought.\nI walked out to about a hundred bemused stares, but when my first joke got a wave of laughter I knew this was going to be OK.\nAfter the show I sat around with some of the nicest people I\u2019ve ever met sharing bitcoin stories and listening to their suggestions about how to improve my routine.\nTwenty-four hours later I was on stage in front of a live studio audience.\nThe host gave me an introduction, the camera swung onto me, and it was show time.\nHow did the world\u2019s first ever bitcoin stand-up routine go?\nWell, I think it went great, the studio audience seemed to like it, and I\u2019ve had nice feedback from viewers, but don\u2019t take my word for it.\nLike Bitcoin I don\u2019t expect you to trust a third party \u2013 go watch the routine on YouTube and make up your own mind.", "year": 2013, "month": 12, "day": 30}

Individuals and companies who mine Bitcoins for their own accounts will not be considered money service businesses or money transmitters within the meaning of the Bank Secrecy Act. The clarification was outlined in a letter sent in response to an inquiry on behalf of Atlantic City Bitcoin, LLC, which was reprinted in full at CoinText\u2019s website.\nSince July of 2011, FinCEN has advised that many companies that deal with Bitcoins, including miners, must register as money service businesses with the Treasury Department and with any state that also regulates MSB\u2019s, even going so far as to send cautionary letters to companies thought to be non-compliant. Though the registration process itself is not overly burdensome at first glance, money service businesses are also required to develop anti-money laundering, reporting and customer verification programs which can be prohibitively expensive to implement and maintain.\nOn March 18, 2013, FinCEN clarified its guidance to exclude certain activities that do not, of themselves, indicate the provision of money services: namely, the use of mined Bitcoins to purchase goods and services or exchange of mined Bitcoins for dollars. This means that private mining operations that do not sell coins to others or mine coins on behalf of others are not money service businesses and do not need to register. Neither organization as a for-profit corporation nor acceptance of investor funds has bearing on this definition. Though FinCEN\u2019s clarification is nine months old, it does not seem to have been generally known to the Bitcoin community before the CoinText.com report.\nThe clarified guidance should come as a significant relief to Bitcoin miners, many of whom have experienced significant problems as a result of regulatory uncertainty. In recent months, many companies that explicitly deal in Bitcoin or whose names contain the words \u201cBitcoin\u201d or \u201cbit\u201d or some variation thereof have had their accounts frozen or closed or have been turned away while attempting to open new accounts at banks across the country. Further, the possibility of enforcement action and the specter of onerous new regulatory requirements have caused many investors to shy away from otherwise promising startups. While FinCEN\u2019s pronouncement may not put Bitcoin into the mainstream, it goes a long way toward resolving one of its most troubling regulatory problems.", "year": 2013, "month": 12, "day": 29}
{"title": "Declaring Bitcoin Income Part 3- Bitcoin As An Asset", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/declaring-bitcoin-income-part-3-bitcoin-asset-1388111751/", "birthday": "Dec 26, 2013  9:35 PM EST", "date": "2013-12-27 02:35:00", "content": "This is the third part of a multi-part series that will discuss how to declare Bitcoin income on US personal or business income tax returns. What follows are my professional opinions and should not be construed as tax or accounting advice. Instead, the articles in this series should be used as the starting point for a discussion with your tax accountant about your personal situation.\u00a0 Back to Part 1- Preparing Your Records.\u00a0 Back to Part 2- Bitcoin As Ordinary Income.\n\u00a0The IRS must answer two questions with regard to virtual currencies: what is their classification and when are gains or losses realized for the purpose of taxation? The first question has bearing on the rate that would apply in situations when Bitcoins are not received in connection with a trade or business or as wages. The second question relates to when gains must be declared or losses can be claimed.\n\u00a0The essence of Bitcoin is its use as a medium of exchange. Bitcoin behaves like currency, is used by both merchants and consumers as a currency and is denominated and can be subdivided like a currency. Its value is almost always stated with reference to currency. At least one agency of the Treasury Department, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, has publicly stated its belief that Bitcoin exchanges fall into the category of money servicers (that is, businesses that exchange or transfer currency) and its intent to regulate them as such. Therefore, the case for Bitcoin as something other than currency is fairly weak, but that does not rule out the possibility that the final regulations will turn out that way or that regulators will develop some sort of hybrid category for virtual currencies that combines various aspects of multiple asset classes.\n\u00a0The second part of this series discussed situations in which Bitcoin transactions would definitely be considered ordinary income and also possible tax treatment for Bitcoin as a currency. For almost all US taxpayers, the functional currency for tax reporting is the US Dollar (the exception would be business taxpayers with a qualified business unit, or QBU). Usually, \u201cforeign currency\u201d means the recognized legal tender of a nation-state or central bank. Since Bitcoin clearly does not fall into this category, the Treasury may ultimately decide that it should be treated as some kind of asset other than currency. Several countries besides the United States, notably several EU member states, have already determined that Bitcoin is a non-currency asset, though differences in tax treatment between Europe and the United States are not uncommon.\nThe IRS defines two types of assets for income tax purposes - capital assets and non-capital assets. All property held by a taxpayer, whether or not connected with a trade or business, is considered a capital asset, except for stock in trade, inventories, real property used in a trade or business, intellectual property in the hands of its creator, accounts receivable, and commodities derivative financial instruments in the hands of recognized dealers in said instruments. \u00a0Excepted property is considered a non-capital asset. The most relevant difference between the two is that proceeds from the sale or exchange of capital assets enjoy capital gains treatment under certain circumstances. However, disposals of capital assets are also subject to capital loss limits - currently the lesser of $3,000 or the amount of offsetting capital gains per year for individuals (corporations are not subject to the $3,000 limit, but are subject to the offsetting gains limit).\n\u00a0The Internal Revenue Code does not recognize commodities as a separate class of asset. Commodities (or usually the option or forward contracts that represent them) are capital assets to individuals other than brokers and dealers (to whom they are non-capital assets). Under almost all circumstances, the description of Bitcoin as a \u201ccommodity\u201d by the IRS would cause it to be a capital asset to an individual. Bitcoins received in connection with a trade or business would still be treated as ordinary income at the time of receipt. Gains or losses realized later under this scenario would receive capital gain/loss treatment.\n\u00a0Taxpayers who either hold Bitcoin long term or who trade Bitcoin in order to take advantage of the volatility and who are not commodities brokers/dealers may be in a position for their income to be treated as a capital gain instead of ordinary income. In order to take the capital gain rate, taxpayers must be prepared to show that they held the associated asset for at least one year - not an easy task for Bitcoin, even when traders are careful with their record keeping. There is a technical reason that this may not even be possible for most Bitcoin traders: in the interest of efficiency, the Bitcoin protocol deliberately uses the smallest blocks of coins possible when a transfer is recorded. This means that investors can neither control nor even determine which lot or lots of Bitcoins were traded at any given time. Nevertheless, the IRS may ultimately allow either some form of synthetic lot tracking or the use of an inventory method such as FIFO or LIFO for calculating gains. Refer to the first part of this series for information about maintaining proper records.\n\u00a0Since January 1, 2011, brokers have been required to report transaction information by lot to the IRS each year on form 1099-B (and provide this to their customers at tax time). Bitcoin doesn\u2019t presently have brokers to keep up with this information or report it to the IRS, though it is not unlikely that the exchanges would eventually be required to report this information if Bitcoin endures.", "year": 2013, "month": 12, "day": 27}
{"title": "eBay Files Patent Application for Programmable Money", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/ebay-files-patent-application-programmable-money-1388464857/", "birthday": "Dec 30, 2013  11:40 PM EST", "date": "2013-12-31 04:40:00", "content": "\"\"Reaching eBay Global Markets with the Help of PayPal Multiple Currencies\"\"\nLet's Talk Bitcoin!\nBitofthis.com\n@inthepixels\nGift giving during the holidays just took on a whole new meaning. eBay, the parent company of PayPal, filed patent application20130339188, \u201cGift Token\u201d with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on June 18, 2012. The USPTO published the application on December 19, 2013. The technology was invented by itsengineers from Tamilnadu, Indiaand assigned to eBay Inc. of San Jose, California.\nThe innocuous sounding application \u201cGift Token\u201d was probably written in such a way as to shield trade secrets from competitive intelligence gathering. It is common for companies to obfuscate their filings to make them harder to decipher. Just like Subway\u2019s Footlongdoesn\u2019t have to bea \u201cfoot long,\u201d buried in the patent application eBay states that \u201cGift Token\u201d does not have to be a gift:\n\u201c\u2026Systems and method are disclosed for giving gifts or payment instruments in the form of security or payment tokens\u2026The token can {be} a gift token. The token does not have to be a gift\u2026 the token can be a payment made by the user to the recipient, such as for goods received or services rendered\u2026\u201d\nthe application abstract is more general in nature:\n\u201c\u2026Systems and methods are disclosed for giving gifts in the form of secure tokens. A gift can be given from a user of a payment provider to a gift recipient. The recipient can be a member of the user\u2019s family, a friend, or any other person or entity. The recipient can use the token to purchase a product using a checkout though the payment provider. The purchase can be made without requiring the user to create the user\u2019s own payment provider account\u2026\u201d\nBefore I delve into the application itself I would like to describe what it is I believe eBay is trying to do with this technology. While the application makes no mention of Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies for that matter they appear to be after \u201cprogramable money.\u201d While this technology is not a digital currency, it is a wrapper around a currency\u2026.any currency.\neBay appears to be creating a cross between \u201ccolored coin\u201d (more on this later) and a whitelist for a currency. Examples of a whitelist includePayment Pathways\u2019 \u201cGreenlist\u201d, IBM\u2019s\u201ce-Currency Validation Authorization Services Platform\u201dandCoin Validation.\nInterest in programmable money has taken off since this introduction of the popular Bitcoin protocol. Bitcoin itself has been called programmable money because it is a protocol like HTTP or \u201cHypertext Transfer Protocol.\u201d More specifically Bitcoin (capital case) is the protocol while bitcoins (lower case) are the units of currency that move across this protocol. The movement of bitcoins across the Bitcoin network was just the initial use for the protocol (hat tip toRichard BrownandAndreas M. Antonopoulos[YouTube] for explaining this). Additional applications being developed include certification such asProof of Existenceand escrow and multisignature authorization found on Bitrated\u00a0arbitration.\nOn June 16, 2010, Satoshi Nakamoto, the founder of Bitcoin,stated in the BitcoinTalk Bitcoin Forumthat this type of functionality was native to Bitcoin and was essentially dormant until developers begin integrating it:\n\u201c\u2026The design supports a tremendous variety of possible transaction types that I designed years ago. Escrow transactions, bonded contracts, third party arbitration, multi-party signature, etc. If Bitcoin catches on in a big way, these are things we\u2019ll want to explore in the future, but they all had to be designed at the beginning to make sure they would be possible later\u2026\u201d\nMastercoin Executive Director Ron Gross(YouTube) may have very well conceived of the colored coin analogy in aBitcoinTalk discussionon November 11, 2011:\n\u201c\u2026the special \u201casset tokens\u201d satoshis are colored, and don\u2019t relate at all to normal satoshis. The one who owns the colored satoshi owns the asset.\u201d\nBitcoinX, now known asColored Coingroup, explains that it is a \u201ca colored bitcoin minting and exchange protocol that works on top of an existing blockchain infrastructure\u201d and further explains what a colored coin is in itsColored Coins \u2013 BitcoinX Whitepaper(which is also co-authored by Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s very own Vitalik Buterin):\n\u201c\u2026 by carefully tracking the origin of a given bitcoin, it is possible to \u201ccolor\u201d a set of bitcoins to distinguish it from the rest. These bitcoins can then have special properties supported by either an issuing agent or by public agreement, and have value independent of the face value of the underlying bitcoins\u2026\u201d\nBack to eBay\u2019s Patent:\n\u201c\u2026Systems and method are disclosed for giving gifts or payment instruments in the form of security or payment tokens, according to an embodiment. A gift or payment instrument can be given from a user of a payment provider, such as PayPal, Inc., to a gift recipient. The recipient can be a member of the user\u2019s family, a friend, a sub-contractor, or any other person or entity. The recipient can use the token to purchase a product using the payment provider. The purchase can be made from a brick and mortar store or an online store. The purchase can be made without requiring the user to create the user\u2019s own payment provider account\u2026\u201d\nWhile being able to send a payment to someone who is not already a pre-existing account holder within the payment platform may sound like an innovation it must be stated that Paypal already has this functionality. As a Paypal Employeeexplainsin the PayPal Community Help Forum:\n\u201cYou can send money to anyone with an email address but in order to claim the funds they would have to open a PayPal account. What happens is that you send the money to their email address, they get an email letting them know they have received funds. They are then instructed to follow the directions to open an account to receive the funds into their PayPal balance.\u201d\nand similar to PayPal, \u201cThe token can be given without the user sharing the user\u2019s credential with the recipient.\u201c\nBlockchain.info also has similar functionality with theirSend To Anyone:\n\u201cSend Via Send Bitcoins using Email, Facebook & SMS\u2026Send To Anyone Send Bitcoins to anyone via Email, SMS or Facebook even if they don\u2019t have a bitcoin address or a My Wallet account.\u201d\nHowever, \u201cGift Token\u201d has an additional feature that makes it particularly flexible:\n\u201c..a person who does not have an account with the payment provider {can} use the token\u2026Whether the recipient has a payment provider account or does not have a payment provider account has no impact upon the recipient\u2019s ability to use the token.\u201d\nThis is extremely important feature and the reason why I determined that this particular patent application even merits discussion (not to mention that eBay had a monumental year for the sheer number of patent applications submitted to the patent office).\nIf this technology were to become ubiquitous, it could very well change our relationship with money.\nThe Colored Coin white paper explains how \u201cA company may wish to create a corporate currency, such as Air Miles rewards points, or even plain coupons.\u201d\nThe eBay patent application further explains:\n\u201c\u2026the token can be limited to use at a specified store, a specified group of stores, or a specified chain of stores. The token can be limited to use in purchasing a specified product. The token can be limited to use geographically. For example, the token can be limited to use within a specified city or group of cities, within a specified state or group of states, within a specified country or group of countries, and/or at any location or group of locations. The token can be limited to use temporally. For example, the token can be limited to use on weekdays, on weekends, from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM on weekdays, and/or at any other time\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOpen Money\u201d\nThe technology behind this patent is reminiscent of Ericsson\u2019s Open Money patent application20130166398\u201cSystem And Method For Implementing A Context Based Payment System.\u201d which includes LDC$ or Location Dependent Currency which Ipreviously discussed on Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin. Those with a dystopian eye will be just as alarmed. While this technology can be used for good \u2026as Ericsson put it\u2026 for the \u201cgood of society\u201d\u2026it can also be used for evil\u2026to control society. There are very serious ramifications behind manipulating the fungibility of money.\nAn innocuous illustration that eBay provided was that a parent can issue the Gift Token to their children with restrictions.\nAn example I can think of is that a child is given an allowance and that the technology would allow the parent to determine how it is used. For instance Gift Token can be programmed to allow the child to purchase anything that is legal for a minor to purchase with the exception of no more than one sugary drink per day.\neBay\u2019s filing further explains how it can be used to restrict and prohibit certain vices such as cigarette and alcohol consumption:\n\u201c\u2026Products can be specified for which the token cannot be used to purchase. For example, a limitation upon the use of the token can specify that the token cannot be used for the purchase of alcohol or cigarettes. Rather than not allowing such items altogether, a limit can be placed on the amount of such purchases in a given time period. For example, $20 worth of beer and $10 worth of cigarettes can be purchased in one week\u2026\u201d\nand further it explains how this technology can be changed based on local laws and ordinances:\n\u201c\u2026 the recipient\u2019s ability to purchase alcohol or cigarettes with the token can change automatically due to a change in the legal age for purchasing alcohol or cigarettes when the change in the law goes into effect\u2026\u201d\nHowever it isn\u2019t hard to imagine a scenario where a company could use this to make restrictions on the salaries of their employees. For example if a organization wanted to cut down on healthcare costs, they could program their employee\u2019s paycheck so that their salary cannot be used to purchase cigarettes. Though this sounds far fetched, remember that eBay\u2019s goal is for this (or any) technology to become ubiquitous and that anyone (even non-account holders) can send, receive and spend this \u201cGift Token.\u201d\n\u201cWhether the recipient has a payment provider account or does not have a payment provider account has no impact upon the recipient\u2019s ability to use the token\u201d\nSimilar to Bitcoin an algorithm is used to secure the Gift Token. Bitcoin uses sha-256 (a.k.a Secure Hash Algorithm) while the Bitcoin-Qt clientusesAES-256-CBC to encrypt the private keys in the bitcoin wallet. eBay suggests using AES-256:\n\u201c\u2026the token can be encrypted. The token can be encrypted using any cryptographic algorithm, such as AES 256 for example\u2026 The payment server or an administrator can determine the strength of the encryption\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMerit\u201d\nI spoke withDavid Birch, Global Ambassador and founding Director ofConsult Hyperion. Mr. Birch is an internationally-recognized thought leader in digital identity and digital money.\nFor those of you concerned about the patentability of this technology Mr. Birch stated that, \u201cThe patent is trivial and obvious\u201d and \u201cI am baffled as to why the US Patent Office allows companies to patent this sort of thing.\u201d\nWhile Bitcoin is a technological achievement, the same probably cannot be said for eBay\u2019s Gift Token. However, whether or not this technology has any merit is up to USPTO and perhaps the legal system to figure out. Even if it is determined that Gift Token is not worthy of a patent being granted doesn\u2019t mean the technology is vaporware nor does it mean that eBay would not try to pursue it.\nMr. Birch did question my comparison of Gift Token to Bitcoin and said that:\n\u201cThe patent is about pre-paid \u201ce-gift cards\u201d (and is unrelated to Bitcoin). It is, essentially, tokenized Visa Buxx\u2026The idea of programmable coins in Bitcoin is new and interesting. The idea of sending \u201crestricted\u201d funds is very different.\u201d\nGift cards typically exist in walled gardens that restrict spending within an ecosystem. For example one cannot spend a Target gift card at Walmart. Prepaid access cards such as \u201cVisa Buxx\u201d allow more flexibility but require the cardholder to use the card within a particular payment network. However, eBay\u2019s gift token is special because it can be used virtually anywhere because anyone can accept it. While the spirit of the patent application may indeed be that of an e-gift card, its versatile nature permits it to be used for so much more. The difference between eBay\u2019s Gift Token being a simple payment instrument and means to program money is not so black and white.\nA Tangled Web We Weave\nPierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, recently wrote a piece for the Huffington Post \u201cWikiLeaks, Press Freedom and Free Expression in the Digital Age\u201d which revisited PayPal\u2019s cutting off of WikiLeak\u2019s PayPal account. Mr. Omidyar referred to the severance of services as a \u201csuspension\u2026for a period of several months\u201d whichbaffled WikiLeaks(Twitter) who considers the ban to be indefinite. However,WikiLeaks was able to circumvent the financial blockade using Bitcoin.\nJulian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks hasstill not been chargedwith any crime in the United States\u2026and yet PayPal cut off WikiLeak\u2019s services. One has to wonder how a so called\u201cenemy of the internet\u201cmight use Gift Token much less the United States.\nThe US government supports freedom on the internet through grants to theTor Project.Examples includethe US Department of State Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor and the National Science Foundation. Tor was originally a U.S. Naval Research Laboratory project and states that it is used \u201cevery day by a wide variety of purposes by normal people, the military, journalists, law enforcement officers, activists, and many others.\u201d One has to wonder if theDark Wallet\u201cYour keys.

As of Christmas morning, BTC is holding steady around$675.\nNow, before all of you say \u201cBitcoin is not all about the price\u201d, relax. You are correct. This year I\u2019ve been fortunate to have travelled all over the world evangelizing Bitcoin. From Austria to Las Vegas, Panama, California, London, Amsterdam, Morocco, Argentina and more meeting Bitcoin communities and building lifelong friendships. One thing I\u2019ll always remember, said to me by long time friend and Bitcoin Foundation general counsel Patrick Murk, \u201cBitcoin is the accumulation of the talent, hard work and dedication of the people who develop and maintain the protocol, build industries around the protocol, the merchants and consumers who use the Bitcoin protocol in their daily lives, and those who promote and protect the protocol. As more people become a part of the Bitcoin community, the value of the system increases.\u201d.\nBitcoin is not simply a currency, or a payment system. Bitcoin is a technology that enables you and I to work together to make the world a better place. Bitcoin not only has the potential for global financial inclusion of the world\u2019s poor, it also provides a stable money supply to people living in some of the world\u2019s most corrupt and irresponsible governments.\nWe\u2019ve had many ups and downs this year, literally. We saw the end of Silk Road and the dawn of government regulation. Some people thought we even found Satoshi. China emerged as a dominant player in the Bitcoin space. Senate hearings and various worldwide government bodies either embraced or tried to slow it down. I say good luck to that. To shut down Bitcoin you\u2019d have to shut down the world\u2019s electricity and the internet. Lastly, Canada and Australia joined the foundation\u2019s initiative to bring together some of the most energetic Bitcoin communities in the world to fulfill our mission to protect, standardize and promote Bitcoin worldwide. Bitcoin is you, me, and all of our hard work. It\u2019s our community and culture that we\u2019ve all decided to make our own \u2013 and we will prevail.\nSatoshi built Bitcoin for us so we that can carry the torch and continue to develop it for mainstream adoption. He gave us the land and now its up to us the build the roads, bridges, and tunnels. 2013 was the year of regulation. 2014 is the year of infrastructure so get ready to build! Circle\u2019s $9 million and Coinbase\u2019s $25 million investments are just the tip of the iceberg. An iceberg full of new ideas, talent and capital just waiting to be tapped by the right people to bring Bitcoin to the masses.\nLooking forward to an even wilder year!\nHappy holidays!\nCharlie Shrem\nVice-Chairman, Bitcoin Foundation\nCEO, BitInstant\n", "year": 2013, "month": 12, "day": 26}

Clearly Canadian is a 30 year old company, whose products were very popular in the 1980s and 1990s, and is especially well known for its flavored sparkling water products including flavors such as wild cherry, green apple, mountain blackberry and even sparkling tea. Since then, the company\u2019s founding management exited in the early 2000s, and for the next decade the company sank into relative obscurity, although the brand remains well-known among older generations of Canadians. Now, however, Clearly Canadian is intent on making a comeback. Today the company relaunched its website, offering what were four of its most popular flavors, and has announced a leaders referral program to get the word out. At the same time, however, Clearly Canadian is intent on recapturing the Canadian (and, of course, American) audience with a new feature: accepting Bitcoin.\nAlthough flavored sparkling water is not a product that is typically associated with Bitcoin users, the Clearly Canadian brand is clearly recognizable to millions of people, making it one of the more prominent, and mainstream, businesses to start accepting Bitcoin.

But we\u2019re not about hatred here, we\u2019re about the science of Bitcoin, so we want to point out to the good Nobelist just how he got it wrong in his \u201cBits and Barbarism\u201d op-ed piece of December 22 in the Newspaper of Record.Krugman is absolutely right about the barbarism of gold, past and present. For the vast majority of people, finding gold in your neighborhood is like the curse of oil; it benefits only the elites who can mine it, store it, and transport it. For everyone else, it is a disaster. Ask the Tainos, Caribs, the Aztecs. Ask folks in present day Papua, South Africa, Congo, Peru or Nevada how much Gold 1.0 is doing for them.Where Krugman is wrong is in taking at face value (pun intended) the notion, spread by some media outlets, speculators and others that Bitcoin is Gold 2.0. It isn\u2019t. In fact, the differences between Bitcoin and gold could not be more stark. The only intersection is a political one, an intersection of two different camps in a narrow political space that exists to push against a perceived common foe: central banks, federal governments and international cabals of the uber rich. This has nothing to do with the fundamental tendencies of these two, very distinct entities. Look at the rhetoric of gold fanatics. They do, as Krugman says, look to the (imaginary) past. Look at the aspirations of the Bitcoin community. They are solidly fixed on the future.So let\u2019s look at the differences between gold and Bitcoin. Gold is a physical representation of wealth created by the exploitation of land and human labor, be it slave, wage-slave or serf. Its very nature makes it amenable to centralization and hoarding in banks. It is difficult to transport and exchange, and it is relatively easy to guard with a few guns. It accumulates to those with ships and armies. Bitcoin is a digital representation of wealth created by the exploitation of non-human labor, that is, computer power. Its very nature makes it amenable to decentralization and networked distribution. It is easy to transport and exchange and it is (therefore) more difficult to guard. It will tend to accumulate with those within the network who facilitate its transaction. In this regard, it is much more like paper money than gold.Gold is the natural preference of the already rich, and the envy of those who want to be like them. It is the store of wealth for those who can afford to hoard it. Bitcoin is the natural preference of those who are not rich, for whom the cost of every transaction is a burden; it is ideal for those who do not have the ability to accumulate large amounts of capital because poverty keeps them living hand-to-mouth.Yes, Mr. Krugman, I agree with you about the barbarity of gold. But if you would just take the time to actually examine the nature of Bitcoin instead of using the misperceptions of others as a cudgel against Bitcoin, perhaps you\u2019d discover something.Isn\u2019t discovering things that are new and perhaps not as they appear in popular misconceptions what Nobel Prizes are awarded for?", "year": 2013, "month": 12, "day": 24}

On December 5th, Bank of America\u2019s foreign exchange strategist David Woo declared a projected market capitalization for Bitcoin of $15 billion and a projected fair value of $1,300. This was a first among major banks and a major nod to Bitcoin\u2019s credibility. However, Woo\u2019s declaration met with some skepticism from Bitcoin advocates, many of whom believe Bitcoin to be a wholly new type of financial instrument and thus not readily comparable to anything else currently known. What is Bitcoin\u2019s true value? Is the current price too high or too low? If the current price is not the \u201cright\u201d price, then how will we know what is?\nEconomically speaking, price is a term that refers to the amount of another resource or commodity demanded in order to obtain a good or service. Usually, but not always, you will find price expressed in terms of currency (barter transactions would be the exception). For example, the price of one gallon of gas may be $3.50 or the price of one Euro may be $1.85. Price is the most efficient signaling mechanism we know of to keep supply and demand near the point of equilibrium and the most useful means of quickly and objectively assessing \u201cworth.\u201d\"Value\" is somewhat tougher to nail down than price. Value refers to the subjective (rather than the objective) perception of worth. A wrench is valuable to a mechanic because it allows him to tighten or remove nuts and bolts, but its price may be fairly modest.\nA master work of art is aesthetically valuable to those who understand and enjoy it. Its constituent parts may cost less than the wrench, but the value may be far more. An item may have sentimental value, aesthetic value or value in use, but rarely will an item have intrinsic value.Intrinsic value is \"value in and of itself.\" Fiat currency, such as the Dollar, Euro, or Bitcoin (yes, Bitcoin is a fiat currency, too) cannot be intrinsically valuable. The value of Bitcoin derives from the variety, volume, type or quality of goods and services that can be received in exchange for it, as opposed to that of the paper and ink or metal (or computing power) used to produce it. If governments outlawed Bitcoin, taxed it into oblivion, or markets just lost interest in it, then its value would decline accordingly.\nFurther, if you could find no one to accept Bitcoin in exchange for anything you wanted to buy, it wouldn\u2019t matter how many you had - their value would be zero and they would be worth nothing to you.The only economically appropriate value for Bitcoin is its market value. Market value is usually considered to be the price that you would receive in an orderly exchange under normal conditions between a willing buyer and a willing seller. When an active market exists for an item, its market value is relatively easy to determine because its price is readily apparent and, if not known to all, is at least known to those who need to know. If no merchants accepted Bitcoin and no exchanges existed to convert it into a functional currency, its value would be likely be close to zero, as was the case when Bitcoin was first conceived.\nConsider the case of the pizza purchased in May 2010 for 10,000 Bitcoins, the price of which would now be equal to $10,000,000.Is Bitcoin something so new and revolutionary that it defies classification? Perhaps it is, though I don\u2019t happen to think so. Does it really matter when it comes to Bitcoin\u2019s value? I think probably not. I don\u2019t claim to know what the price of one Bitcoin will be next year or even next week, but I do know that I\u2019ll have to take the price that is offered if I want to spend it, whether I like that price or not. That, to me, is the only thing that really matters.", "year": 2013, "month": 12, "day": 6}

Skip to Part 2- Bitcoin as Ordinary Income. Skip to Part 3- Bitcoin as an Asset.\nWhat follows are my personal opinions and should not be construed as tax or accounting advice. As of the time of publication, the IRS has released no specific guidance as to how Bitcoin transactions should be declared. You should always consult a qualified tax accountant about your personal situation before taking a position on any tax matter, especially with an issue as novel and complex as Bitcoin.\nThe 2014 tax filing season is scheduled to begin during the first week of February, but may be delayed if another government closure occurs in January. Unless you received an extension, tax filings are not due until April 15th (March 15th for corporations), but now is the time to start constructing or gathering your records. If you declare income or claim expenses originally denominated in Bitcoin and you are selected for a tax audit, the completeness and manner of presentation of your records will play a major role in whether your position is accepted by the IRS. The more discrepancies your records have, the harder the auditor will look for other problems.\nIn order for records to be accepted as reliable, they must be both accurate and complete. Your records must reconcile \u2013 that is, the transactions presented must show a clear mathematical relationship between the starting and ending balances of your holdings. If you use several or many wallets to carry out Bitcoin transactions, be prepared to show complete records for all of them. Also, be aware that knowing your Bitcoin addresses will allow the auditor (or anyone) to track your activity by reviewing the block chain.\nTransaction records should contain the following information:\n\u00b7 Ending balance as of midnight on December 31, 2012 for all wallets with activity that you need to declare. Usually, this will be all wallets with activity that includes more than personal Bitcoin denominated purchases. This becomes your starting balance for 2013.\n\u00b7 Date, amount in BTC, exchange rate to your functional currency, source and purpose for all incoming and outgoing transactions. You may want to use a single source for exchange rates. Your records will not necessarily be disallowed if you select the most advantageous rate of exchange at the time of each transaction, but you will create more record keeping work for yourself and thus a higher burden of proof if you are subjected to an audit. Remember, if you omit transactions, then your records will not balance. If you have transactions that you cannot account for (such as transfers to or from other personal wallets), it may appear that you are attempting to hide income.\n\u00b7 Ending balance as of midnight on December 31, 2013 for all wallets with activity that you need to declare.\n\u00b7 Ideally, all of your income and expense transactions would be backed by sale and purchase invoices. Review my series on using Bitcoin with QuickBooks here for instructions on how to create a \u201cpaper trail\u201d in your accounting system. Your accounting records and your Bitcoin ledger are mutually supporting sets of documentation.\nTax treatment and calculation of basis will be covered in greater depth later. However, regardless of how Bitcoin arbitrage income is classified by the IRS, Bitcoin income from a trade or business will almost certainly be treated as ordinary income. Tax basis and tax rate are separate issues \u2013 basis determination is likely to be the same under all tax rate scenarios. All of the normal rules concerning deductible expenses remain in effect.\nHere are a few additional notes:\n\u00b7 Mined Bitcoins have a basis of $0. They are declarable as income as of the date you receive them. Be sure to record the exchange rate in effect at that time, even if you don\u2019t plan to exchange them right away. This will be the amount of income to declare and also your tax basis.\n\u00b7 Bitcoins received in connection with a trade or business have a basis equal to your profit on the transaction. For retail sales, this equals the selling price minus cost of goods sold. Personal services usually have little or no deductible cost component.\n\u00b7 Business income transactions have two parts to their taxability \u2013 the profit on the original sale for which you received the Bitcoins and the gain (or loss) on exchange at the time you convert them to Dollars. Both parts won\u2019t necessarily occur in the same year. If you convert to dollars immediately (this is an option on Coinbase and other retail platforms), then you need not worry about the second part.\n\u00b7 Bitcoin expense transactions can be claimed at their value in US dollars as of the point at which the transaction occurred.\nExample Bitcoin Ledger\nDate Description/Purpose Amount Rate Gain (Loss)\n01/01/2013 Starting Balance 1 BTC $1000/BTC $0[i]\n03/01/2013 Sell 1 Widget (cost $300) +.5 BTC $850/BTC $125[ii]\n04/01/2013 Sell 1 Hour Consulting +.1 BTC $700/BTC $70[iii]\n06/30/2013 Converted to Cash -1.6 BTC $1100/BTC $165[iv]\n07/01/2013 Sell 1 Widget (cost $300) +.425 BTC $1000/BTC $125\n09/30/2013 Buy 1 Widget (cost $300) -.333 BTC $900/BTC $0\n12/31/2013 Ending Balance .092 BTC[v] $600/BTC $0\n\n[i] Basis assumes all taxes paid on prior gains.

With credit cards, if you buy something but never receive the product, you can issue a chargeback to recover your funds potentially weeks after the transaction. With Bitcoin, on the other hand, no such option exists. Of course, in many cases the lack of chargebacks in Bitcoin is actualy an advantage; in transactions where the two parties have an established relationship, or one party is a reputable business, the possibility for any kind of fraud on the merchant\u2019s side is quite low, and the lack of an institution to mediate chargebacks is what allows Bitcoin to avoid the high fees charged by credit cards and Paypal. But nevertheless, there are definitely many industries in which the level of consumer protection that credit cards offer is very useful \u2013 and, so far, in those cases Bitcoin has had little to offer. Now, however, Bitrated is positioning itself to be the first mainstream Bitcoin service to change that fact.\nBitrated\u2019s solution to consumer protection is in some ways an old one: escrow. Rather than a customer sending a payment to a merchant directly, the customer sends the payment into escrow, and the funds are released from escrow only when the customer confirms that they received the product or service. However, Bitrated makes one major addition to the model: multisignature transactions. Rather than the customer sending money directly to a trusted escrow agent, the customer sends the money to what is called a \u201c2-of-3 multisignature address\u201d constructed using the customer, merchant and escrow agent\u2019s public keys. The mechanics behind a 2-of-3 address are exactly what one might guess from the name: funds sent to this address can only be spent with the cooperation of any two of the three parties.\nThe process for making an escrow transaction in Bitrated works roughly as follows:\nSuppose that Alice wants to send money to Bob through escrow. To start off, Alice goes to the Bitrated website and goes to \u201cBrowse arbitrators\u201d. She then selects an escrow agent (say, Trent) and clicks \u201cStart transaction\u201d.Alice pastes the conditions of the transaction (eg. \u201cin exchange for the 0.5 BTC, Bob ([email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=\"currentScript\"in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\"),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\"cf-hash\"))return t[e]}();if(t&&t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(\"data-cfemail\");if(a){for(e=\"\",r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]> */) agrees to send Alice ([email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=\"currentScript\"in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\"),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\"cf-hash\"))return t[e]}();if(t&&t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(\"data-cfemail\");if(a){for(e=\"\",r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]> */) a new Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone, still in the box and undamaged\u201d; for actual escrows, Bitrated offers a helpful page listing important details to include in the contract). She clicks \u201cstart\u201d,The Bitrated interface provides Alice with a link. Alice sends this link over to Bob, and Bob opens the link in his web browser, and accepts the contract.At this point, the Bitrated interface generates the 2-of-3 multisignature address between Alice, Bob ad Trent (because only Trent\u2019s public key is required to make such an address, this can be done without Trent\u2019s participation). Alice sends funds to the address, and after one confirmation (usually 0-15 minutes) Bob sees that the funds are in escrow.When Alice wants to release the funds, she enters Bob\u2019s address and an amount to release, and clicks \u201crelease\u201d. The interface creates a transaction sending the specified amount to Bob\u2019s address, and signs it with Alice\u2019s private key.Bob sees a pending transaction in his interface, and he clicks on it to inspect it. Seeing that the transaction is sending funds to his address, he clicks \u201capprove\u201d. The interface signs the transaction with Bob\u2019s private key and the transaction is published, completing the transfer.\nIf Alice and Bob have a dispute, at the bottom of the page the interface presents a link which either of the two can send to Trent. At that point, Trent will contact Alice and Bob to gather evidence from both of them, and adjudicate the dispute. If he rules in favor of Alice, he will construct a transaction sending the funds to Alice\u2019s address and sign it. Alice will then need to approve the transaction, at which point she will have her funds back. If Trent rules in favor of Bob, the same process occurs between him and Bob.\nWhat are the advantages of this multisignature escrow process? There are three main factors to consider. First, in all cases where there is no dispute Trent is not involved at all. As a result, nearly all transactions will have no fee. If Trent gets involved, he will likely charge a fee, but the fact that fees are charged only when the escrow agent is actually brought in ensures that the system is paid for primarily by the very same people who make the heaviest use of it \u2013 a drastic change from the credit card system, where the fallout from fraud is evenly spread across everyone in the form of a 2.9% fee charged to every merchant and ultimately passed on to every consumer, regardless of how much due diligence each individual consumer does to deal with reputable merchants. Second, even if Alice and Bob bitterly disagree over whether or not Bob adequately fulfilled the conditions to receive the payment, if they both agree that Trent is doing a bad job of adjudicating, or is charging excessive fees, the two can sign a transaction together to send the funds directly into another escrow with another escrow agent. Finally, Trent himself has no opportunity to run away with the funds. In theory, Trent can conspire with Alice to split the funds fifty-fifty and leave Bob with nothing, but such a situation would require two of the three parties involved to be dishonest, rather than only one.\nIf multisignature escrow is so attractive, why has it not been done before? The answer is, of course, that it has been done; the tools to do so have existed since 2012, and are now available in the form of moderately easy-to-use command line tools such as sx and my own pybtctool. Bitrated innovates over such cruder \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d escrow solutions in several places. First, the service is very easy to use. Anyone can understand how to use Bitrated even if they have no idea how multisignature transactions or public and private keys work. And for those users who are more advanced, Bitrated provides the option for users to add their own public key instead of having one generated for them by the service.\nSecond, the service is very well-designed from a security standpoint; although Javascript web applications do have some inherent weaknesses, with the exception of those flaws (which can also be avoided if Bitrated chooses to release a version of their service as a Chrome extension rather than a website) Bitrated appears to be doing everything right. Bitrated itself keeps no data on its server; all of the information associated with any particular escrow transaction is stored in Alice or Bob\u2019s URL. Here\u2019s one example of what Bob\u2019s URL looks like:\nhttps://www.bitrated.com/tx.html#DO-NOT-SHARE=&alice=A0Wt4mpYCsUGk3Hj5ltGy3OAs6%2Fp48k%2B7mmX9xIP4fm3&trent=AwiltCrGDPdhQSCXAeBPa3bcuRhTYb0iU%2F%2B5KIcvKHJG&terms=SnVzdCBhc3N1bWUgdGhhdCB0aGUgc2Vjb25kIHBhcnR5IGlzIHJpZ2h0IGluIHRoZSBldmVudCBvZiBhIGRpc3B1dGUu&proof=H96yEdTbcRxpfKdkGAf7C8B7%2FKHJm1Fx7c%2FzrOgKfHPoLq6WVISJQgwZFJo5d9WXrd9wdbKhEY%2FdFjbji6YYROs%3D&bob_priv=c9F6LSfqy9MA9dD%2FHb3oHqCisGYpsSR3M6btuS0RrvcB\nThe first thing that we see is that most of the data is hidden behind a \u201chashtag\u201d (a technical term for a number sign). This is an idea originally conceived by the creators of RushWallet, an online \u201cinstant wallet\u201d service requiring no username or password. The reasoning behind this choice is that the data behind the hashtag is actually not sent to the server, meaning that the server learns almost nothing about any of the transactions that take place over its site. Right now, the server does see partially signed transactions, but in future versions even that data transfer would be encrypted. Then, we see five parameters: \u201calice\u201d, \u201ctrent\u201d, \u201cterms\u201d, \u201cproof\u201d, \u201cbob-priv\u201d, each with a value that is made up of around fifty letters and numbers. All five of these parameters are base64 encodings; the value of the \u201calice\u201d parameter represents Alice\u2019s public key, the \u201ctrent\u201d parameter Trent\u2019s public key, \u201cterms\u201d the terms, \u201cproof\u201d a signature of the terms by Alice (proving that the terms were not modified in transit) and \u201cbob_priv\u201d Bob\u2019s private key. Alice has a similar URL but with her private key and a signature from Bob instead of herself. Thus, even if BitRated shuts down, Alice and Bob can still decode their URLs and, perhaps with the help of a more technical user, get their funds out.\nOne area where Bitrated is still lacking, however, is in the choice of escrow agents. The escrow agent list is essentially unmoderated, and although a sort of reputation system is present it is still difficult to determine how trustworthy an escrow agent is. A partnership with professional escrow agents that are vetted by Bitrated may improve the service in the short term, especially if Bitrated intends to target those users who are not yet used to the concept of evaluating and choosing their own escrow agents. Bitrated\u2019s current architecture also presents a problem on the escrow agent\u2019s side: escrow agents have no way of filtering escrows. In fact, it is technically possible to use literally anyone who has ever sent a Bitcoin transaction as an escrow agent without their permission. On the one hand, this does make life easier for Alice and Bob \u2013 Alice does not need to wait for her escrow transaction to be approved before sending the funds. On the other hand, many escrow agents will likely want to set restrictions on the kinds of deals that they adjudicate \u2013 perhaps even limiting deals to a few standard transaction types. Although escrow agents can certainly simply state their policies on their webpage and refuse to even look at arbitration requests from noncompliant escrows, the service could be improved by creating a more explicit interface for escrow agents to set their policies.\nWhat is the future of Bitrated going to be? At this point, Bitrated is still limited in scope; the service as it stands is designed only for person-to-person transactions with an active participant at each end. One possible next step that Bitrated may wish to target is facilitating semi-automated transactions such as e-commerce setups. If Bitrated is correctly set up to deal with such transactions, online e-commerce startups should be able to \u201cplug in\u201d to third party arbitration with minimal effort. All they would need to do is show the customer a multisignature address instead of their address, and provide an interface for the customer to confirm that they received a given product. If Bitrated reaches that stage, then multisignature arbitration may well become a mainstream, low-cost alternative to traditional credit card transactions with chargebacks. Such a system would protect the merchant and the customer, and if a given merchant always delivers what they promise and never gets into a dispute the fees on both sides would be quite low. The future of consumer protection with cryptocurrency is only just beginning.", "year": 2013, "month": 12, "day": 10}

Although the day after the event was relatively calm in the Western world, with Bitcoin markets dropping only by 10% and the Bitcoin reddit covered with threads reassuring readers that the announcement was a positive for BItcoin. In China, however, the price immediately crashed by 25%. The next day, however, Baidu Jiasule and China Telecom stopped accepting Bitcoin, and the mood rapidly began to turn sour. Bitcoin markets on both sides were in disarray, both crashing by about 50% from the pre-announcement highs over the course of twelve hours before making a partial recovery. Now that the initial shock of the news is over, what is going to happen next? Exactly how will the Chinese Bitcoin community react from here, and what are the consequences going to be in the medium to long term?\nFirst, it is important to note what the immediate causes of the price crash were. Although no one has access to an alternate universe simulator, and so we can never truly know what would have happened had certain events gone differently, certain facts about the Bitcoin economy allow us to make solid educated guesses. First of all, the bulk of the rise from $125 to $1000 was backed by Chinese speculation. Evidence that China was \"leading the rally\" is plentiful, ranging from technical analysis on price movements around the time when Bitcoin broke through the 165 USD / 1000 CNY level, to BitcoinQt download statistics showing China climbing up to (and, as of the time of this writing, staying at) first place in the number of downloads, and the rapid growth of volume in Chinese exchanges, culminating in BTCChina taking over first place. The trigger that many felt was the true turning point that started the rapid rise, however, was Baidu Jiasule, a subsidiary of Baidu, accepting Bitcoin for its services. Soon after that, China Telecom, a state-owned telecommunications company that is the second largest in the industry in China, also started accepting Bitcoin for reservations of their latest Samsung phone. These two companies, the so-called \"Chinese Google\" on the one hand and a state-owned telecommunications company on the other, were seen as by far the largest endorsement of Bitcoin that has ever happened to date. And now, in the span of a few hours, they are both gone.\nIn reality, however, the influence of both companies has always been overhyped. The Baidu announcement was not \"Baidu accepting Bitcoin\" to anything close to the extent to which, say, Namecheap accepts Bitcoin for its entire array of products and services. Rather, Baidu Jiasule is only one small subsidiary of Baidu. In fact, the company received very few actual customers - the 1.37 BTC that the company did receive was the product of Western Bitcoin users sending Baidu donations to show support. Similarly, in the case of China Telecom, China Telecom was not accepting Bitcoin for its telecom services; it was only taking it for pre-orders of the latest Samsung phone. The Chinese economy is much more organizationally centralized on both a government and corporate level, but what many do not understand the system to some extent naturally compensates for this to a partial extent by giving individual corporate divisions and local governments considerably more independence. Although Baidu Jiasule almost certainly did get approval from Baidu's management before taking Bitcoin, neither Baidu mangement nor Baidu Jiasule ever intended for the announcement to be anything close to a company-wide endorsement. Now, the portion of the Bitcoin bubble that relied on this mistaken assumption can be officially considered to be popped.\nWhat About the Regulations?\nThe public opinion on the first day after the news, when Baidu Jiasule and China Telecom had not yet stopped accepting Bitcoin and much of the reaction was still positive, was arguably the more correct viewpoint. Most Chinese Bitcoin users active on the forums and various semi-private channels interpreted the news in a cautiously positive manner, although the markets clearly acknowledged that the announcement is putting a brake on Bitcoin's prospects in the very short term. In order to understand why the news is positive, however, one must understand what is going on in more detail both by itself, and in the context of the Chinese regulatory strategy as a whole.\nThe regulatory announcement had five parts, of which the first two were the most important. First, Bitcoin is classified as a commodity, not a currency, meaning that Bitcoin exchanges do not need to register under currency trading regulations. Second, \"financial institutions and payment institution\" are forbidden from buying and selling bitcoins or offering Bitcoin-related products and services. The category of \"financial institutions and payment institutions\" is a restrictive one - essentially, it only includes banks and perhaps the Chinese equivelents of Visa, Mastercard and Paypal. Bitcoin exchanges are still free and clear to operate. This is made more clear by another section of the announcement, requiring exchanges to register with telecommunications authorities - why would the Chinese government require exchanges to register with anyone, if exchanges are not even allowed to exist?\nJoseph Wang, who describes himself as an \"Ex-VP Quant [at a] Big Investment Bank\", writes the following opinion on Quora:\n The PBC has basically given the green light for bitcoin trading and exchanges. They are trying to keep bitcoin trading \"separate\" from the other parts of the financial system so that if bitcoin blows up, then nothing bad will happen. The thing that I think they are worried about is a Lehman style situation in which something blowing up in derivatives brings down the rest of the economy.\nThree months ago, the situation in China was simultaneously much more calm and unclear. Although it was evident that Chinese interest in Bitcoin was present, and growing, the Chinese government was remaining silent on the matter, and no one was certain whether the silence should be interpreted positively or negatively. Some believed that the Chinese government had basically quietly given the Bitcoin economy the green light; others argues that the government was simply \"institutionally unaware\" of Bitcoin's presence, and if Bitcoin were to grow to any significant extent they would eventually clamp down hard. I personally was in the former camp, and even argued that the Chinese government was moving to establish Bitcoin as a sort of \"special economic zone\". \nChina\u2019s special economic zone (SEZ) program was first created in the early 1980s as part of China\u2019s economic modernization initiative, creating specific locations with business-friendly policies in order to attract foreign investment, as well as experiment with different ways of increasing economic freedom so as to determine which policies would be best to expand to China as a whole. The idea would satisfy the more conservative elements of the Chinese government, which wanted to exercise the precautionary principle and keep the bulk of the country under tight control, but would also allow a high degree of freedom to those industries that needed it. The result has been an interesting one; although mainland China remains heavily controlled by the Chinese government, the various special economic zones, and especially semi-independent territories like Hong Kong, have come to be economically favorable jurisdictions even by the standards of the west. The idea has its parallels in Western thought, with the recent statement by Larry Page that he wanted to \"set aside a part of the world\" for unregulated experimentation, and to an even greater extent with the recently popular concept of seasteading. \nAnd now, with the People's Bank of China's announcement, the establishment of Bitcoin as yet another one of these areas - the first ever that only exists in cyberspace, has essentially become official. The announcement specifically forbade the existing Chinese banking system from interacting with the Bitcoin economy, but otherwise created an environment for the Bitcoin economy that some have described as even more free than that of Europe. Although exchanges are required to follow know-your-customer guidelines and register with telecommunications authorities, aside from this they do not need any kind of financial license in order to operate. The Bitcoin economy will be allowed to grow, and businesses related to Bitcoin mining, trading and using Bitcoin as a payment mechanism - provided that prices are not set in BTC - will be allowed to continue to exist and prosper.\n In fact, for those advocates of Bitcoin who appreciate it for its community aspects and because it has no connections to the existing financial system, this is even positive news, as the Bitcoin economy will be growing on its own without being rapidly \"taken over\" by the banking sector. In the short term, this may not be positive for Bitcoin's price, as multi-billion-dollar speculators and hedge funds inside of China will not be able to participate in the Bitcoin economy through instruments like the Exante Bitcoin fund or SecondMarket's offering in the United States. In the long term, however, if Bitcoin continues to grow, the Chinese government will undoubtedly allow Bitcoin to interface with the mainstream financial system in due time - that is, of course, if Bitcoin and other more powerful crypto-financial networks do not outright replace it.

Whether you are a hard core Bitcoin miner or just a casual trader, it is likely that you\u2019ve racked up substantial gains in 2013. There are just a few weeks left in the tax year, but it is not too late for you to take action to trim your tax bill.\nMost tax planning strategies involve timing actions that you would have taken anyway in order to exploit temporary advantages in your situation. For volatile assets such as Bitcoin, the easiest thing that you can do is to harvest losses by selling when the market is down. For this year, that may not be very realistic unless the price takes a nosedive in the next several weeks. However, if you believe that your gains may be taxed at a higher rate in the future, then now may be a good time to take them. For example, if you have treated your Bitcoins as a capital asset in prior years and took the long term capital rate on any gains, but believe that Bitcoin may be taxed at ordinary income rates in the future, then now might be a good time to book your gains at the lower rate. Final rules clarifying Bitcoin\u2019s place in the tax code may not be written for some time yet, but your tax position for earlier years is more likely to be sustained by the IRS in the absence of clear guidance if it is consistent over time.\nEquipment purchased in connection with a trade or business usually must be capitalized and depreciated over a five year period. For companies engaged in Bitcoin related operations, this includes computers used as controllers, ASIC chips, USB hubs, USB erupters, cooling fans and other gear used in support of a Bitcoin mining operation. This equipment tends to wear out or become obsolete long before the end of the recovery period, a major disadvantage from a tax standpoint. However, businesses can elect under Section 179 to expense up to $500k of the value of equipment purchased and put into service during 2013. If you a have large amount of other expenses, you may alternatively elect to claim 50% bonus depreciation on your capital equipment in the first year of operation under Section 168(k). These enhanced provisions (also known as \u201ctax extenders\u201d) are scheduled to expire at the end of 2013, so you have only a short time left to put additional assets into use in order to take advantage. Note that in order to qualify, equipment must actually be put into operation, not just on order or under contract. Another tax extender that expires at the end of 2013 is the deduction for state and local sales tax. Most purchases of equipment are subject to sales tax, so this is yet another way to save money by accelerating a large purchase that you may have already intended to make.\nPhilanthropy is an integral part of the long term tax and estate plans for many taxpayers. You may consider donating some of your hoard of Bitcoins before the end of the year in order to take the charitable contributions deduction. You can convert Bitcoins to dollars and deduct the cash, but many charities now accept donations directly in Bitcoin. In this case, your deduction will be based on the dollar price of Bitcoin on the day you make the donation. Be sure to obtain a receipt.\nIf you qualify to contribute to an IRA this year and you haven\u2019t fully funded one yet, you might want to cash out some of your Bitcoins to save for retirement. You can deduct up to $5,500 from your taxable income ($6,500 if you are age 50 or older) by contributing to an IRA. There are plans in the works for one or more Bitcoin backed mutual funds, so if you want to keep your cash invested in Bitcoin then be sure to check whether your broker is likely to offer them. Alternatively, if you participate in an employer run 401(k) or 403(b) plan and haven\u2019t contributed the maximum for 2013, you could ramp up your contributions for your last one or two paychecks of the year, replacing the \u201clost\u201d income with liquidated Bitcoins. This would have the effect of \u201cdeferring\u201d some of your Bitcoin gains into your retirement account. If you are really ambitious, then you may qualify to establish a SIMPLE IRA or SEP for your Bitcoin business so that you can put even more away.\nFinally, the dreaded Net Investment Income Tax deserves a mention in this article. This isn\u2019t a tax planning strategy, but may be a good reason to do what you can to reduce your taxable income. This 3.8% tax became law in 2010 as part of the Affordable Care Act, went into effect on January 1, 2013 and applies to all of your net investment and passive activity income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds $200,000 (or $250,000 for married couples filing jointly). Though Bitcoin isn\u2019t referred to by name in the statute, it is almost certain that arbitrage gains and mining gains will be subject to the tax.\nThese are just a few of the possible strategies that may help to reduce your 2013 tax bill, but you will need to move fast. If you have suggestions for others, please share them in the comments. Always consult a qualified tax accountant before executing any tax avoidance strategy. If you find yourself with a larger tax bill than you\u2019d like on April 15th, just remember that owing more taxes usually means that you made more money. Pat yourself on the back, crack open a cold one, and tell yourself you\u2019ll do a better job planning next time!", "year": 2013, "month": 12, "day": 5}
{"title": "China Releases First Regulatory Report on Bitcoin Businesses", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/china-releases-first-regulatory-report-on-bitcoin-businesses-1386283989/", "birthday": "Dec 5, 2013  5:53 PM EST", "date": "2013-12-05 22:53:00", "content": "After months of regulatory uncertainty in the Chinese Bitcoin community, the People\u2019s Bank of China has announced their first major report regarding the legal and regulatory status of Bitcoin. The document, which can be seen as a parallel of the similar report drafted by FINCEN in March this year, is the first to officially classify Bitcoin in the eyes of the Chinese government, and lays out the restrictions on what Bitcoin-related services various categories of businesses and institutions in China are allowed to provide.\nThe document, translated into English on Reddit, has five sections, of which the first two are most interesting:\nCorrect understanding of the properties of Bitcoin. Bitcoin has four main features: lack of geographical restrictions, anonymity, no central issuer and a limited supply. Although Bitcoin is referred to as a \u201ccurrency\u201d, it is not issued by a monetary authority and does not have the legal tender status of a currency, so it is not at all money in the true sense. Bitcoin should be a specific virtual commodity, and does not have the legal status of a monetary equivalent.Financial institutions and payment institutions cannot develop Bitcoin-related services. At the present stage, financial institutions and payment institutions may not set a fixed price in Bitcoin for products or services, act as a central counterparty for trading Bitcoin, underwrite insurance related to Bitcoin, directly or indirectly provide other services related to bitcoin, including registration, transaction, clearing and settlement services, issuing Bitcoin-related financial services, or using Bitcoin in investment trusts and funds.\nThe next three sections are also important, but more mundane. The third section requires Bitcoin sites to register with the telecommunications regulatory authorities, the fourth section clarifies that Bitcoin sites are expected to have anti-money-laundering policies similar to those demanded of US and European exchanges, and finally the last section emphasizes that Bitcoin businesses should help promote the \u201ccorrect understanding of virtual commodities and currencies, rational investment, control of investment risk and protection of financial safety\u201d and \u201cguide the public to establish a correct conception of money and investment\u201d.\nSo Is This Good or Bad?\nThe second section appears to be by far the most damning at first glance; if interpreted incorrectly, it may seem to essentially state that Bitcoin trading and offering products and services in exchange for Bitcoin is illegal entirely. However, in reality the restriction is much weaker than it seems; although the restriction does prohibit nearly all Bitcoin-related activity except perhaps trivial services like offering a Bitcoin price chart, it only applies to \u201cfinancial institutions and payment institutions\u201d \u2013 essentially, Chinese banks and perhaps also services like Alipay, the Chinese equivalent of Paypal.\nThus, investment funds like the SecondMarket fund in the United States, or the proposed Winklevoss offering, which have been seeing significant attention and interest on the part of US-based Bitcoin investors, are most likely out. Direct banking integration similar to the deal between bitcoin.de and Fidor Bank will also be impossible, at least for the time being. Bitcoin exchanges, on the other hand, will be able to continue operating, since Bitcoin exchanges are not \u201cfinancial institutions\u201d or \u201cpayment institutions\u201d, and most of them will not need to make any substantial changes to the way that their businesses operate. The fact that exchanges are not included as financial or payment institutions has been confirmed as the most probable interpretation by several Chinese Bitcoin users, and is the arguably the only interpretation that makes sense \u2013 otherwise, why would the People\u2019s Bank write that Chinese Bitcoin exchanges are not allowed to operate in one section and then state that they are required to register with telecommunication authorities in another section? Whether or not a Chinese Bitcoin exchange will be able to offer a payment service like BitPay, however, is still an open question, and one which Chinese Bitcoin users are actively researching.\nThe first section, clarifying the regulatory status of Bitcoin, is even more favorable. Because Bitcoin is now officially classified as a virtual commodity, and not money, a large class of financial regulation now simply does not apply to Bitcoin businesses. \u201cIf Btc is considered money at current stage, all exchanges [would have to] gain their license to continue,\u201d 8BTC\u2019s James Choi explains. \u201cThe financial license is very hard to get.\u201d But since Bitcoin is not classified as money, \u201cthey don\u2019t need the license.\u201d Bitcoin exchanges will still be regulated as telecommunications services, but they will not need to endure anything close to the sort of heavy financial regulatory burden borne by exchanges in the US.\nOn the other hand, being classified as a virtual commodity does leave open one potential worry: are Bitcoin trades covered by China\u2019s 17% sales tax? Fortunately, there are several considerations in the Chinese Bitcoin community\u2019s favor. First of all, China\u2019s sales tax is a value added tax, so in theory, if someone can show that they bought bitcoins at one price and then sold at another price, they would only be required to pay tax on the difference. Second, the tax affects only those individuals and institutions that are actually directly engaged in buying and selling bitcoins, and if Chinese Bitcoin exchanges only act as intermediaries and do not buy and sell bitcoins themselves they will likely be in the clear \u2013 although, of course, they will be required to pay corporate tax on the profits. The situation is similar in the Chinese stock markets \u2013 although, in theory, investors are required to pay capital gains tax on their earnings, in practice many do not, and tax enforcement generally focuses on making sure that exchanges and brokers pay their dues.\nThe Bitcoin price dropped by over 20% when the news first broke, but has since quickly recovered over half of the drop. For many people, this report has certainly been a reality shock, as a significant number of Bitcoin users perhaps naively saw China\u2019s initial acceptance of Bitcoin as a sign that the Chinese government was positioning itself as a progressive bastion of freedom that would not try to impose any regulation on Bitcoin exchanges at all. From a more realistic standpoint, however, the news is nothing but positive. The regulatory uncertainty that existed earlier has been substituted with a definite regulatory framework, and one which imposes a regulatory burden on Bitcoin exchanges themselves much lighter than that in the United States, and perhaps comparable to that in Europe.\nDirect integration with Chinese banks will not happen yet, but in practice this may well simply mean that the Chinese Bitcoin community will have more time to evolve on its own without being rapidly taken over by the professional banking sector. Bitcoin exchanges can now move forward without fear that Bitcoin or even Bitcoin exchange will be banned outright. Finally, the Chinese Bitcoin community may see a glimmer of hope for Bitcoin in the opening words of the second section of the regulatory report: \u201cat the present stage\u201d. We can only wait and see what the next stages of Bitcoin\u2019s growth will bring.", "year": 2013, "month": 12, "day": 5}

This procedure will allow you to properly account your Bitcoin expenses and integrate those expenses into your business records as if they had originally been made in your home currency.\nQuickBooks\u2019 workflow model allows you to track accounts payable by vendor, reminds you when your bills are due and provides an easy to understand way to enter payments. If you are fortunate enough to identify a vendor in your supply chain that accepts Bitcoin, then you may choose to do this instead of converting to dollars. However, you should ensure that your vendor dynamically updates the Bitcoin exchange rate so that prices remain relatively stable in your functional currency.\n1. Enter a bill into Quickbooks using the \u201cEnter Bills\u201d function on the home screen. Update the vendor name, address, and payment terms and assign an expense account to the expenditure. This will most likely be a cost of goods sold (\u201cCOGS\u201d) account if you are purchasing items for resale. Be sure to enter the amount of the bill in your functional currency; QuickBooks will not allow you to enter bills in other currencies unless the multi-currency function discussed in Part 1 of this series has been activated. Also, don\u2019t forget to enter the due date.\n2. At this point, your only options are checking account or credit card account to pay bills. QuickBooks will not allow you to pay using the Bitcoin account that you created previously. When the bill comes due or when you decide to pay, you will need to work around this by creating a general journal entry.\n3. Select \u201cMake General Journal Entries\u201d from the \u201cCompany\u201d menu. This will open the Journal Entry window. Your entry should look like this:\nAccount Debit Credit Name_______\nAP Amount Vendor\nBitcoin Wallet Amount\nThis entry will post a credit balance to the sub-journal in your accounts receivable ledger for the vendor that you want to pay. Note that this will not work if the vendor is not set up in your QuickBooks file or if you forget to select the correct vendor from the name box.\n4. Select the \u201cPay Bills\u201d option from the home screen. Select the bill that you want to pay by checking the box next to it. Near the bottom of the screen, you should see the amount you just posted for \u201cTotal Credits Available.\u201d\n5. Click the \u201cSet Credits\u201d button, then check the box next to the credit amount to apply the credit as a payment and click \u201cDone.\u201d Two things should happen \u2013 the credit amount you entered should zero out and the bill should now show as paid.\nQuickBooks automatically numbers journal entries in the order entered, not by date, so be aware that your entries may appear out of order if you post-date them to reflect a future payment. Also, you may need to revalue your wallet before or after you use it to pay bills to ensure that you don\u2019t end up with an incorrect ending balance for that account. See Part 2 for instructions on how to do this.\nAs always, this is one of several ways to account for this kind of transaction in QuickBooks. Other procedures may work equally well.

Bitcoin was arguably the first of the trend, giving the user full control over their funds with no trusted third parties whatsoever, and encryption and decryption done on the client side. Since then, we have seen encrypted email replacements like BitMessage, blockchain-based identity systems like Namecoin and even entire encrypted social networks such as Diaspora and tent.io. At the same time, we have seen a trend in making Bitcoin wallets easier to use \u2013 first, we had the bulky desktop client Bitcoin-Qt, but more recently we have seen the lightweight desktop client Electrum, numerous mobile phone clients and even in-browser wallets like blockchain.info.

KryptoKit takes the idea of blockchain.info\u2019s wallet, which comes packaged as a Chrome and Firefox extension, and pushes it one step further \u2013 with Kryptokit, in order to use the wallet you do not even need to open a new tab. Instead, the interface simply exposes itself as a popup from the top right corner of the browser window, allowing users to send and receive bitcoins directly from whatever page they happen to be browsing. In fact, KryptoKit goes even further \u2013 every time you go to a new page, the wallet processes the page, captures every Bitcoin address it can find, and lists all of the addresses at the top of the interface. You can then click on any of the addresses in the list to automatically select it.\nThis is not the first time Di Iorio and Dakh have developed a Bitcoin wallet. Over the past six months, the two have spent a considerable amount of time on another project: RushWallet, an online Bitcoin wallet that has no usernames and passwords. Instead of using usernames and passwords for security, each individual RushWallet account is identifies by a \u201csecret URL\u201d, where the URL itself contains all of the information needed to generate the wallet\u2019s address and private key. This core idea behind RushWallet was not new; a similar \u201csecret URL\u201d based wallet known as InstaWallet had existed since 2011. However, Instawallet faced two major problems, which ultimately proved to be its undoing. First, the funds were stored server-side, rendering all users\u2019 funds vulnerable if the server was hacked. Second, when the user would enter their unique wallet URL in the browser, the URL would naturally go to the server as part of the HTTP request to retrieve the webpage. This information would then, as happens by default, be kept in a server log file. In April 2013, as it turns out, InstaWallet\u2019s server was hacked. Fortunately, the attacker was unable to seize the funds directly, but they did manage to retrieve many URLs from the server\u2019s database, allowing them to immediately proceed to empty a large number of compromised accounts. InstaWallet was quickly taken offline and would never come back.\nRushWallet fixes both of these problems. In RushWallet, the funds are stored client side \u2013 part of the URL is the seed for the private key, and the Bitcoin cryptography is done using Javascript code executed inside the browser. The part of the URL that stores the seed in Rushwallet is the \u201chash\u201d \u2013 the part after the number sign. For example, if the URL is http://rushwallet.com/#Hq23BbGtL9Nwu4BARbciZ2bAVBpWVrP8QuemfQQrt1kUyCoy5G, the hash is Hq23BbGtL9Nwu4BARbciZ2bAVBpWVrP8QuemfQQrt1kUyCoy5G. Because of the way HTTP was designed, the hash part of the URL actually never goes to the server, so aside from quietly and deliberately inserting malicious Javascript code into the application RushWallet itself has no way of accessing the funds. And it worked. \u201cSecret URLs are a proven system,\u201d Di Iorio writes, \u201cand we never had any issues with it.\u201d\nSeeing RushWallet\u2019s initial success, Dakh decided that it was time to take the project a step further. \u201cJust a couple weeks ago,\u201d Di Iorio relates, \u201c[Dakh] messaged me that he was working on something new. It turned out to be a Chrome extension. At first it was a frontend with blockchain.info, but then we incorporated RushWallet and it works perfectly now. Deposits and withdrawals are instant, the secure URL system is trustworthy and it works properly.\u201d The wallet is very easy to set up; when a user first loads the wallet, they can securely create a new private key by moving their mouse around to generate random data, although they can also import a brainwallet if they so choose. From there, the wallet simply functions as any other ordinary Bitcoin wallet would. The security model works just like Rushwallet; \u201ccredentials are stored client-side, so nothing goes to the servers,\u201d Di Iorio says. And now, after weeks of development and testing, Di Iorio and Dakh are ready to finally release their wallet to the public.\n\u201cEnkrypted\u201d Messaging\n\nHowever, despite its unprecedented ease of use, the wallet is arguably not even the most impressive part of Kryptokit. That honor goes to the other tab of the extension: the encrypted messaging interface. The messaging interface is based on GPG, a popular open-source implementation of the original PGP protocol invented by Paul Zimmerman in 1991, which is still the gold standard of secure email today. KryptoKit functions as a fully self-contained GPG platform, allowing users to create new GPG keys inside the interface, but one can also import an existing key from other PGP/GPG applications such as Enigmail.\nOnce a user has a private key inside KryptoKit, the user can then ask their friends for their public keys, and load the public keys into KryptoKit. Once two users have each other\u2019s public keys and their own private keys loaded into KryptoKit, they can encrypt messages for each other, and send the encrypted messages through the application. The encryption is handled seamlessly; once KryptoKit is set up, all that a user needs to do is write the message, select the recipient, enter their password and click \u201cSend\u201d. The recipient will then immediately see a notification that they have a new message, and will be able to view it, entering their password to unlock their private key so they can decrypt the message. The decryption, once again, is seamless; once the recipient clicks \u201cView message\u201d and enters their password, they will simply see the message appear in unencrypted form in a popup.\nAside from perhaps the unfamiliar aspect of users needing to ask their friends for a public key, KryptoKit offers what is literally the simplest possible interface for GPG encrypted messaging that one can create. Users need to enter their password to send and receive messages, but aside from that all of the cryptography is handled automatically inside the application. In theory, applications like Enigmail, a plugin that seamlessly integrates GPG encrypted email into the popular desktop mail client Thunderbird, have existed for years; in practice however, fewer and fewer people use desktop mail clients every year, and the ease of use of simply installing a browser extension and having everything \u201cjust work\u201d is unprecedented. Even among users who do not care about encryption, the concept of having a messaging app in the top right corner of their own web browser is by itself a powerful feature, so KryptoKit has a serious potential to take off even among less technical users to a much greater extent than previous applications like Enigmail.\nOne possible suggestion for KryptoKit to target the non-technical market even further is to improve the one aspect of the application that is still unintuitive: the key management. Ideally, KryptoKit would include an interface to public key servers such as those at Maiz and MIT, and perhaps even the decentralized key server that is the Namecoin network, so that users can simply search for their friends\u2019 names inside of the application and have the public key downloaded from the key server and imported into KryptoKit automatically. The app would also, of course, provide the opposite functionality \u2013 allowing users to upload their keys to Mainz and MIT\u2019s keyservers from inside the application. At that point, KryptoKit may even choose to remove all references to \u201cencrypted\u201d inside the application \u2013 it would simply be a messaging app that requires a password, and the key management would be in the background, accessible to those advanced users who are interested in working with the lower-level cryptographic details, and otherwise simply serving as a passive reassurance that the messaging is secure.\nThere are also plenty of other directions in which KryptoKit can go much further, and the developers themselves have stated that many of these improvements are already planned for future versions of the software. The first obvious next step is to offer, in addition to its current email-style messaging platform, a chat interface, perhaps using the OTR protocol instead of plain GPG. OTR has the advantage that it is possible to send a message \u201coff the record\u201d (hence the name) \u2013 although the recipient certainly can copy the sender\u2019s message and paste it to whoever they want, the protocol is designed in such a way that the recipient will not be able to prove to anyone else that it was the sender who sent the message. From there, other forms of communication are also feasible; voice and video communication is perhaps next in line. Finally, the last step would be to include a fully fledged social network, that would also serve as a decentralized marketplace with a functioning reputation system. Altogether, Di Iorio summarizes, \u201cyou [would] have a social network that is secure and encrypted and is also a payment mechanism, all in a file less than 1 MB\u201d.\nIn the near term, however, there are also other, more general, priorities that Di Iorio intends to address. \u201cThe next step is to put the community behind this,\u201d Di Iorio explains. \u201cWe could put bounties for people to either add functionality or put $10000 behind some private key [as a challenge to locate security vulnerabilities].\u201d For monetization, Di Iorio reassures users that he will definitely keep the app free. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting numbers and people using it,\u201d Di Iorio explains. Instead, he says, \u201cwe could localize an ad spot at the bottom of the extension. If you\u2019re in Canada, it would be a link to CaVirtex, or localbitcoins. If we were to do it that way, we would actually be adding value in the ads.\u201d\nAnd his claim is correct; given that the GPG feature of KryptoKit by itself will be enough to attract many users, the app may well introduce new users to Bitcoin, and they would benefit from having an easy link to a local exchange where they can buy bitcoins. But even without any of these features, KryptoKit is here, now. It offers a highly user-friendly and efficient Bitcoin wallet, and its messaging app can be set up within minutes. If you already use encrypted email, you can even import all of your friends\u2019 public keys right away. If either of these features interest you, you should consider downloading KryptoKit and starting to use it today.", "year": 2013, "month": 12, "day": 11}

What follows are my professional opinions and should not be construed as tax or accounting advice. Instead, the articles in this series should be used as the starting point for a discussion with your tax accountant about your individual situation. Back to Part 1- Preparing Your Records. Skip to Part 3- Bitcoin as an Asset.\nUS Code Title 26, Section 61 defines gross income in the context of income taxes. Though Bitcoin is not specifically referenced, Section 61 is understood to mean all transfers of wealth not specifically excepted or exempted. The IRS is diligently working on regulations governing the use of online currencies, including crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin. As a matter of policy, the IRS declines to provide personalized guidance for issues under judicial or legislative consideration. Until then, the usual sources of guidance, such as technical advice memoranda and private letter rulings, will not be unavailable.\nBottom line up front \u2013 the usual tax rules that apply to ordinary income also apply to Bitcoin received under the same circumstances by United States taxpayers. Income earned by a person subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the United States must be declared and is taxable without regard for where it is earned, though certain exemptions and credits exist for foreign income and foreign taxes paid. This part of the series specifically discusses circumstances under which Bitcoin might be treated as ordinary income. Later parts will discuss Bitcoins as a capital or non-capital asset.\nGenerally speaking, there are three ways that wealth can be treated under the Internal Revenue Code when it passes into a taxpayer\u2019s possession: ordinary or earned income, returns on capital, and inheritances or gifts. Depending on the circumstances, Bitcoin may fall into any of the three categories. The fact of Bitcoin\u2019s taxability is not in question, only the classification and timing of the income that is to be taxed. The answers to these questions turn on a number of factors, so it is important to base your treatment on a complete understanding of the circumstances surrounding your receipt of Bitcoins.\n\u00b7 Mined Bitcoins are recognizable as ordinary income when realized. Mined Bitcoins are considered realized at the moment they are mined, but may be somewhat later if the taxpayer participates in a mining trust or guild. Whether or not the taxpayer actually \u201ctakes possession\u201d of the Bitcoins is not a factor, only that he had the legal right and ability to do so. There is precedent for this either in the treatment of treasure trove property (found money), or as income from a trade or business.\n\u00b7 Receipts denominated in Bitcoin, whether received in connection with a service or in exchange for tangible personal property, are recognizable as ordinary income when realized. Realization depends on whether the taxpayer reports on the cash basis or the accrual basis (almost all individuals and small to medium sized businesses report on the cash basis). This is true even if Bitcoin is ultimately found to be a capital asset.\n\u00b7 Short term (holding period of less than one year) exchange gains on Bitcoin are recognizable as ordinary income at the time of exchange. Long term gains may also be recognizable as ordinary income if Bitcoin is classified as a currency. Note that the wash sale rules do not apply to gains, so income can be taken incrementally if your tax strategy assumes that gains will occur over multiple years.\n\u00b7 Gifts denominated in Bitcoin are excludable from gross income up to the applicable tax-free gift limit. Only recognized not-for-profit entities can receive donations, whereas individuals cannot.\nA quick note about income tax reporting \u2013 I have been asked by more than one client what would happen if Bitcoin income is not declared \u2013 \u201chow would the IRS know?\u201d My answer is the same as with any other form of income \u2013 perhaps you could \u201cforget\u201d to include your Bitcoin gains and get away with it, but I would strongly discourage it. First, there are analytical ways to identify the existence of undeclared income. If you have used any of the exchanges to convert to dollars, the extra income will be found using nothing more complex or labor intensive than examining your bank statements. Second, there are serious consequences associated with under-reported or unreported income. At the very least, you will be on the hook for additional taxes, penalty and interest. If the underpayment is found to be due to fraudulent intent, you may also be subject to civil penalties or criminal prosecution, a fine, and even jail time.", "year": 2013, "month": 12, "day": 19}

The full text of the opposition filing reads:\nThe Bitcoin Alliance of Canada (BAC) has become aware that an applicant has applied to the Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO) for the \u201cBITCOIN\u201d word mark in Canada. This application has not been granted by CIPO. We oppose this application. Bitcoin is, on its own, purely descriptive and not distinctive, and this application covers wares and services that go to the heart of the bitcoin protocol. We don\u2019t object to trade-marks that help consumers differentiate among competing products and that protect producers\u2019 valuable investments in reputation. However, the word \u201cbitcoin,\u201d all by itself, is a word that should be left in the public domain and free to the public to use. We believe that registration of this trade-mark in Canada would potentially inhibit the ability of Canadians to use this innovative new technology, stifle innovation, and impose unnecessary costs on Canadian merchants and consumers. No other governmental authority of which we are aware has granted a trade-mark in respect of this single word with the breadth of wares and services included in this application. Therefore, the BAC has drafted an open letter to CIPO regarding this application. The application can be found here [hyperlink]. We trust that CIPO will do its usual great work and seriously consider the legal standard for registration under the Trade-Marks Act.

I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed my journey. You can play the game with paper and pencil.\nBACKGROUND\nPart of my work at the Computing Department of Imperial College London consists in providing real world applications for their findings in Artificial Intelligence research. Such research is focused in developing efficient searching algorithms in order to attack large decision trees.\nAnd what is a decision tree? Suppose a Tic-Tac-Toe game with free opening (playing on the centre square on the first turn is not mandatory). I have 9 possible first moves (I have to decide which one to play). On your turn, you have 8 possible responses for my first move (you have to decide which one you play). Then I have 7 responses on my turn, and so on. If we draw a diagram with all possible moves, it will look like the following figure. Notice the tree structure that is generated. Every node of the tree, where a branch splits into several other branches, is a decision point.\n\nFigure 1: The Tic-Tac-Toe tree (condensed).\nFinding the best move in a given turn is a problem. These algorithms try to solve it.\nThe decision tree for Tic-Tac-Toe is quite small. But the trees for games like Chess or GO are gigantic (the number of different possible games of GO is larger than the number of particles in the universe). When coding an Artificial Intelligence algorithm for playing these types of games, we have to assume that browsing the whole tree is impossible. So we use algorithms that find optimal solutions without searching the whole tree (the best possible solution in a given time), even if they\u2019re not the best moves overall.\nThe most advanced algorithm uses a very smart mechanism to achieve this. It tests promising moves by playing thousands of game simulations for those moves. This process is called exploitation, and it converges to a solution (optimal or not) over time. But at the same time, it tests other moves just in case it\u2019s missed a potentially better one. This is called exploration, and it diverges from the possible solutions already being tested, in order to find another ones. The algorithm perfectly balances both processes with outstanding results\u00b9\u00b7\u00b9.\nI\u2019m not a computer scientist, so it took me a bit to understand this mechanism by just reading the code. But being a teacher myself, I know that the best way to understand something, is trying to reword it so you can teach it to a kid. So I took what initially looked like a complex algorithm, and turned it into a simple diagram.\n\nFigure 2: The T-shaped diagram.\nThis \u2018T-shaped\u2019 diagram shows how the algorithm balances both convergent (arrow pointing down) and divergent processes (two-headed arrow on top).\nAfter coming up with this diagram, I realized that this resembles how humans try to solve problems. We use several areas of expertise to attack them (divergent thinking) and at the same time we exploit the most promising ones (convergent thinking). And we do this for every stone we find in our path. Moreover, the more we balance both ways of thinking, the more efficient we became in solving the problem.\nSOLVING A PROBLEM: GAME CREATION\nWhen I create games, I\u2019m in fact trying to solve a problem: to design a good game\u00b9\u00b7\u00b2. But when I\u2019m designing a game, I\u2019m not aware of the design process itself. I\u2019m just focused on the game.\nThat day in 2012, with all this in mind, I was willing to create a tile-laying game\u00b9\u00b7\u00b3. After spending several weeks trying to exploit a handful of mechanics and components without success, I became self aware of the creative process that I was executing, and realized that something was missing. I was too focused on the exploitation part of the process, while ignoring the exploration part.\nAs I mentioned above, exploration relates to divergent thinking. In 1967 in order to measure Divergent Thinking, J.P. Guilford developed the Alternative Uses Test. It gives you two minutes to think of as many uses as possible for an everyday object like a chair, a spoon, or a paper clip as you can. A regular person can think of up to 15 different uses for the given object. The more creative you are, the more uses you are likely to think of. But the population group that gives the highest score for the test is\u2026 kids!\nSo I decided to plug a bit of divergence on my design process by asking for help to the most divergent person I\u2019ve ever met: my daughter. She was four at that time.\n Sweetheart, would you like to design a game with daddy? Yes, daddy. Great! How do you want it to be? Look, daddy. We place a sheep here, a wolf here, and a dog in the middle, so the wolf doesn't eat the sheep. The wolves want to eat the sheep, but the sheep escape from the wolves and the dogs bark the wolves to scare them so they don't eat sheep. !!!\nI drew the tile in 5 minutes with some cliparts:\n\nPicture 3: The tile.\n\u2026 and two days later the game was finished!\nSHEEP, DOGS AND WOLVES\nTwo players (Sheep and Wolf) share a common pool of 23 rectangular tiles like the one in figure 3. Instead of using tiles, you can play with paper and pencil (see below). The \u2018sheep\u2019 player must save as many sheep as possible (by placing dogs next to wolves, but keeping the sheep away from them), and the \u2018wolf\u2019 player must eat as many sheep as possible (by placing wolves next to sheep but not next to dogs). The game takes place over two rounds. In the first round, one player plays as the sheep, the other as the wolves. In the second round, the roles reverse. Whoever saves more sheep playing the \u2018sheep\u2019 role wins the game.\nYou\u2019ll need a graph paper, a regular pencil and a colour pencil (red, for example).\nWhite circles will represent sheep, red circles will represent dogs and black circles will represent wolves. Draw a tile according to the figure.\n\nFigure 4: Game setup.\nStarting with the \u2018sheep\u2019 player, players take turns drawing a tile (sheep-dog-wolf\u00b2\u00b7\u00b9) in any orientation and direction (not diagonal), and touching at least one already drawn tile (corners don\u2019t count as \u2018touching\u2019).\n\nFigure 5: Example of game state after Sheep\u2019s first move. Notice how the new tile has been placed vertically pointing upwards.\nThe game ends when each player has taken 11 turns\u00b2\u00b7\u00b2. To get the \u2018sheep\u2019 score, do the following, in order:\n Draw an \u2018X\u2019 on each and every wolf that has at least 2 adjacent dogs (corners don\u2019t count). These wolves are \u2018scared\u2019 of the dogs and won\u2019t eat sheep\u00b2\u00b7\u00b3.\n Draw an \u2018X\u2019 on each and every sheep that is adjacent at least to one wolf that is not scared of the dogs. These sheep have been eaten by the wolves.\n Count the remaining sheep (the ones with no X\u2019s on them), which are \u2018safe\u2019. This is the \u2018sheep\u2019 score.\n\nFigure 6: Example of endgame. Sheep scores 11 points.\n\u00a0THE CHALLENGES\nChallenge 1: Find the best move for the wolf player.\n\nFigure 7: Challenge 1.\nChallenge 2: Find the best move for the sheep player.\n\nFigure 8: Challenge 2.\nChallenge 3: How many tiles can you fit into a 7x7 grid so that no 2 dogs are placed next to each other (touching) and the \u2018sheep\u2019 score is maximum?\nPlease post your answers in my forum:\nhttp://nestorgames.freeforums.org/bitcoin-magazine-puzzles-f16.html\n... and I will reward the best post with a copy of one of my games.

I do recommend reading his article on\u00a0international money smuggling.\nAs wasteful as it sounds to spend $17 million a day to gain $4.4 million, this article is based on false data. Mining Bitcoins may use a boat load of electricity, but there are profitable miners out there unlike Tim\u2019s article claims.\nThe data used in the article is from\u00a0blockchain.info, a company near and dear to my heart, that provides a nice spread of Bitcoin services like wallet management & coin mixing services, block info, a well designed page for Bitcoin public addresses, and several charts and stats to help folks digest the complex and elegant solution to financial freedom that is Bitcoin.\nIt just so happens that Tim choose the most inaccurate piece of data on blockchain.info and I\u2019ll illustrate why in just a second.\nBitcoin miners\u2019 electricity use is quite high and miners don\u2019t think twice about it. Well they start to reconsider when their profits are swallowed by electricity costs. And respond by either selling their miners to new Bitcoin users who have caught the Bitcoin mining bug or decide to repurpose their miners for the highly speculative market of mining Altcoins.\u00a0\nThe rest of the info I present will show how truth is often in error when summarized by statistics and boiled down to one number. Here are some tables I whipped up showing the range of miners available to Bitcoin users with ASIC miners.\nI\u2019ve compiled a short list of miners from companies who have or claim to have miners on inventory. They have been seen in the wild and mining happily while Bitcoin enthusiasts around the world cheer them on or yell at them for not just buying Bitcoins with their money.\n\u00a0\nThe first problem is assuming all miners use 650 Watts per gigahash. The nature of ASIC design is to manufacture more efficient ASIC over time increasing hashing power and use less electricity with each iteration. One year, a 65nm ASIC miner may very well draw 650 Watts, but the next generations of ASIC miners will get more efficient and could draw 550 Watts. This page of stats, to my knowledge, hasn\u2019t been updated to reflect the latest miners that have come online in the past year.\n\n\nTable 1: I used\u00a0http://mining.thegenesisblock.com/\u00a0for the miner information. The shipping dates and availability on this site is out of date, but the list of companies is comprehensive.\nHere\u2019s another table that shows the range of residential electricity rates in the United States and around the world [sources\u00a01\u00a02].\n\n\nTable 2: Sample of International Electrical Costs within the past 2 years.\nDenmark has a peculiar situation where households pay far more than the average business for electricity based on this\u00a0published data\u00a0which is based in Euros.\nThe second problem is the blockchain.info\u2019s stat pegs the average electrical use to $0.15 per kilowatt. The table listing the electrical costs for various regions of the world clearly shows a miner\u2019s location should be considered even before thinking about a miner. Certain towns have large corporations absorbing the lion\u2019s share of the electrical costs. Others may use solar power or gas generators.\nHere\u2019s yet another table showing the data from the first table with the worst case scenario of the second table comparing the profitability of a miner in Denmark if they were to use any of the \u00a0miners available right now.\n\n\n\nTable 3: Combination of Table 1 and 2\nI found out the estimated profits by logging on to\u00a0https://webchat.freenode.net/#and in the #kncminer channel is a bot called elwizbot. This bot is something special as it is the most accurate estimate and calculator of Bitcoin earnings per day and hour. I have no clue who wrote this bot or how it makes its calculations, but as each difficulty changes, its estimates based on the earnings from users on that irc chat and on KnCMiner forums are pretty accurate.\nIf you send elwizbot a certain command, it will give you estimated Bitcoin earnings.\nThe last table shows that even in Denmark, a miner could pay off their ridiculously high electric bill and afford to save Bitcoins at the same time. This profit is heavily dependant on price, but with the current prices crossing the $1,000 mark passed twice this year (currently lower now!), several miners have made enough to pay for their miner based on the accounts of some\u00a0miners.\nEven with the true cost being somewhat better than what is reported at blockchain.info, I don\u2019t advocate going out and grabbing a miner (or paying for the promise of a future miner) this late in the game. I do hope anyone in the market for a miner would consider more than 1 statistic on 1 webpage. At least verify theBitcoin community\u2019s results\u00a0at the Bitcointalk mining forum and hear what others have said about their Bitcoin mining experience with miners and mining companies. It is important to know how reliable a company is, since\u00a0some have gone bankrupt, have unrealistic delivery schedules, or encounter delays due to the complexity of manufacturing cutting edge ASIC technology.\nAnother argument against purchasing ASIC mining technology is the concept behind the difficulty of the Bitcoin network. The difficulty looks at the average time it takes to process a block from the blockchain and if it is under 10 minutes the difficulty goes up. If the time is over 10 minutes the difficulty drops. As the Bitcoin network grows the blocks will be processed faster and almost guarantee an increase in difficulty that makes it harder and harder to squeeze out Bitcoin mining rewards.\nA more interesting topic would be to explore where the average miner gets their electricity. Looking past electric companies and into how their electricity is generated, whether it be from combustible fuels, nuclear, hydroelectric, geothermal, wind, or solar this would be a far more fruitful discussion to determine whether miners are feeding into the naughty (nuclear power) or nice (mining with solar power) ways of getting power to verify Bitcoin transactions.\n\nNotes\n1) I realize Jupiter is currently out of stock, but used this miner as an example of the most efficient miner. Theoretically this miner could be purchased second hand.\n2) I also realize comparing the earnings over 1 month with a difficulty that adjusts every 2016 blocks or every\u00a010-12 days\u00a0is very futile. This is why I used the upcoming difficulty which will be around 1 billion and not the current difficulty of around 900 million.", "year": 2013, "month": 12, "day": 18}

It\u2019s more like a self-referential maze, a tricky concept.\nYou\u2019ll need two coloured pencils (red and blue for example) and a notepad for bookkeeping in case you wish to submit your answers for a prize (see below).\nBACKGROUND STORY AND HOW TO CRAWL\nTwo prisoners are trapped in a maze.

The currency has acquired significant interest in the past few weeks, especially so because it has been picked up not just inside the Bitcoin community, but also among two mainstream figures: Bill Still, an American journalist, film producer and author responsible for the films The Money Masters and The Secret of Oz, and Max Keiser, host of a show with millions of viewers on the Russia Today TV network. So what is this new coin that seems to have so suddenly come out of nowhere, and why has it succeeded in getting so much attention where even Peercoin and Primecoin have failed?\nQuark differs from Bitcoin in three key ways: its proof of work algorithm, its block interval and its distribution model. The proof of work algorithm in any (Bitcoin-like) cryptocurrency is the function that miners must compute in order to create valid blocks; in Bitcoin, for example, a valid block must have a SHA256 hash starting with 0000000000000000000 (that\u2019s fifteen hexadecimal zeroes). Because SHA256 is essentially a pseudorandom function, the only way to create such a block is to keep trying, making an average of 260attempts, before you eventually create a block that is valid. Artificially making block creation so hard is a security measure; it ensures that attackers will not be able to flood the network with illegitimate blocks, and therefore a fraudulent transaction history, without having more computing power than the entire legitimate network combined.\nThe proof of work algorithm in Quark is more complicated than Bitcoin, but not excessively so; instead of using just one hash function as Bitcoin does, Quark uses six: BLAKE, Blue Midnight Wish, Groestl, JH, Skein and Keccak. The six algorithms are implemented in series, with nine steps; three of the steps randomly apply one of two out of these six functions depending on the value of a bit. The point of this is twofold. First, it is intended to make Quark more resistant against the \u201cblack swan\u201d risk of a single hash function getting cracked. Second, it is intended to make the currency secure against specialized hardware or even GPUs; \u201cBeing only CPU mined,\u201d the introduction reads, \u201cthis coin offers the average individual the rewards of mining.\u201d\nThe block interval in Bitcoin is 10 minutes, meaning that the \u201cdifficulty\u201d (ie. the number of zeroes that a valid proof of work must have its SHA256 hash start with) automatically adjusts so that the network produces one block per ten minutes. In Quark, the interval is an ambitious 30 seconds. The distribution model in Bitcoin is an exponential decay model: for the first 210000 blocks (~4 years), 50 BTC is released per 10 minutes, for the next 210000 blocks 25 per 10 minutes, then 12.5 per 10 minutes, and so on in an exponential decay until eventually issuance will stop entirely in 2140. Quark\u2019s issuance model is a similar exponential decay, but much faster; it starts off at 2048 QRK per block for three weeks, then 1024 for three weeks, and so on until it reaches 1 QRK per block after about seven months. Unlike Bitcoin, however, Quark then stays at 1 QRK per block forever \u2013 a \u201cpermanent linear inflation\u201d model whose inflation rate will start off at 0.5%.\nSo What Are The Flaws?\nUnfortunately, although Quarkcoin tries to make a number of bold and daring improvements on the Bitcoin parameters, it arguably fails in its objectives on almost every count. We can go through the various changes that Quarkcoin made, and see that almost each and every one of them either does a substandard job of doing what it is intended to do or even introduces problems of its own.\nFirst, the hashing algorithms. As described above, the intent of having six hash algorithms is (1) to protect against \u201cblack swan\u201d attacks on hash algorithms, and (2) to make the coin unfriendly to specialized hardware. The first purpose seems reasonable at first glance; if one of the six hash functions get cracked, that particular block will always be found instantly, and the other five hash functions will remain standing. However, the way that it was done manages to be simultaneously superfluous and inadequate.\nOne thing that must be understood about hash functions is that, unlike most public-key algorithms, hash functions are often very opaque in their implementations, relying on complicated permutations and arbitrary substitutions and transforms rather than elegant mathematics involving modular exponentiation or elliptic curve points. The design of hash functions attempts to maximize properties known as diffusion, confusion and nonlinearity \u2013 essentially, professional cryptographers literally come together and try to figure out how to make a function as opaque and jumbled up as possible so that no one, including the cryptographers themselves, can figure out what\u2019s going on inside.\nAs a result, hash functions tend to naturally have many built-in redundancies, and it shows. When the MD5 hash function was cracked, it went down slowly. In 1993, researchers first found a \u201cpseudo-collision\u201d \u2013 two changes to an internal parameter called an initialization vector that lead to the same output. In 1996, researchers found a \u201ccollision\u201d \u2013 two inputs that produce the same output \u2013 to one specific internal component of MD5, the compression function. It was not until 2004 that these insights were converted into a full collision attack on MD5 itself. Even today, MD5 is actually not fully broken; althoush collisions, finding X and Y such that MD5(x) = MD5(y), can be done in only a million computational steps, pre-images, or finding X such that MD5(x) = Y for a prespecified Y, still take over 2100steps (although no longer quite the initial 2128. Hence, hash functions like SHA256 are already highly redundant and black-swan proof. In fact, if a critical black swan event does occur, it will likely be something like P=NP or quantum computing that affects all hash functions at once.\nFurthermore, there is one place where the algorithm does not use redundant hash functions: the Merkle tree. Quark\u2019s Merkle tree still uses good old SHA256. What\u2019s more, an attack on Bitcoin\u2019s Merkle tree does not even need the harder pre-image attack \u2013 a mere collision attack, albeit a highly specialized one, will suffice to make a double spend and even fork the entire network. The process is simple: make two transactions, T1: A -> B and T2: A -> A, such that hash(T1) = hash(T2). Publish T1. Then, publish T2 later and spread around blocks containing T2 in place of T1. Now, suppose B tries to spend the bitcoins that he received in a transaction T3. Some nodes, which have T1, will see that T3 is spending the bitcoins from T1 and thus recognize T3 as legitimate, and eventually a miner will make a block, B1, containing T3. Other miners, that have T2, however, will see T3 as invalid because it is spending bitcoins that have been sent to A, and thus reject B1. They will eventually make a new block B2 without T3. From there, the blockchain will split in half, with some blocks following B1 and others following B2. All this requires only a relatively simple collision attack against SHA256, and Quark does nothing against this.\nThe second application of Quark\u2019s multi-hash mechanism is its resistance to ultraefficient mining through specialized hardware. However, the combined hash function created by composing BLAKE, groestl and the other functions does not have any particularly special properties; it is simply a hash function which takes up nine times as many lines of code. Producing specialized hardware devices (ie. ASICs) for mining it will certainly take nine times as much work, but once they exist they will be every bit as efficient as Bitcoin ASICs. They only do not exist now because there is not enough interest in Quark. A better way to make an ASIC-resistant coin is to use so-called \u201cmemory-hard hash functions\u201d \u2013 functions that take a large amount of memory, as well as time, to calculate, so devices that attempt to do the computation millions of times in parallel will need to have petabytes of memory on hand; Litecoin does this, as does Primecoin with its sieve-based prime number chain algorithm, albeit unintentionally.\nNext, we come to Quark\u2019s 30 second block time. The idea of making blockchains with faster confirmations is a seductive one; Litecoin started the trend with its 2.5-minute blocks, Primecoin has 1-minute blocks, and now even faster coins like Krugercoin exist with 15-second blocks. Although accepting payments with any of these currencies is equally near-instant, as confirmations are not really required for security in most applications, such currencies have definite advantages in high-security applications such as gambling sites and depositing to exchanges. However, below roughly one minute such currencies run into two problems. First, there is the issue of \u201cstale\u201d blocks \u2013 when a miner finds a valid block, it takes about twelve seconds for that block to propagate through the network, and if any other miners find a valid block in those twelve seconds their work is essentially wasted. With a 10-minute block time, this is only a two percent decrease in de-facto network security. With a 2.5-minute block time, it becomes eight percent and with a 1-minute block time it becomes about 17% \u2013 significant, but far from fatal. Below one minute, however, these stales start to seriously threaten the security of the network.\nThe second issue is one of centralization. Suppose that miners are now organized into mining pools, where one mining pool necessarily has more market share than the others. Suppose this top mining pool has a 25% market share, and its next competitor is at 15%, and the baseline stale rate is 33%. Solo miners have 67% efficiency due to the stale rate. The 15% mining pool, however, itself mines the block 15% of the time, and so starts immediately working on the next block without delay. Hence, the 15% pool\u2019s stale rate is only 33% * 0.85, or 28% \u2013 or 72% efficiency. The 25% pool enjoys 75% efficiency. Thus, new miners have an incentive to join the largest pool, making it even more powerful. This effect inevitably leads to large centralized mining pools which, combined with the reduces network security, means that one mining pool will almost certainly have de-facto control over the entire network. With Bitcoin and its 2% stale rate, this is not a significant issue. With Primecoin at 17%, this is a moderate concern. With Quark, this is arguably a fundamental flaw.\nOne possible solution to the first problem comes from a recent paper by Yonatan Sompolinsky and Aviv Zohar which suggests a way to actually include stale blocks as part of the blockchain; if a new currency integrated this, it may be able to address the security loss potentially down to even below a 10-second block time. However, the solution does not fully address the second concern; if these stale blocks that are part of the chain receive their mining rewards, then the currency becomes much weaker because there is no longer any incentive not to support fraudulent double-spending attacks, and if the stale blocks do not receive their rewards the efficiency centralization issue remains. Perhaps with some compromise, however, 10-30 second block times can be made viable in the future.\nFinally, we have the distribution model. 50% of all Quark units were distributed within three weeks, a much steeper distribution curve than Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency except perhaps Mastercoin and Ripple. Many have come to call his model a de-facto premine, \u201cpremine\u201d being the technical term for when a currency is created with a number of units already in the hands of some centralized party. The Quark developers have made a post addressing this concern, saying that their currency is more fairly distributed than any other altcoin, showing that the percentage of all Quark units owned by the top 100 addresses (59%) is actually right in the middle of those of other major cryptocurrencies (cf. Namecoin at 56%, Litecoin at 48% and Peercoin at 64%).\nHowever, this is somewhat misleading; of all of these other currencies, the percentage in question is the percentage out of those coins that are already in circulation. In the case of Litecoin, Peercoin and Namecoin, there are still many millions of currency units left to be distributed \u2013 and there is no particular reason why these new currency units should go to the same early adopters who were lucky enough to secure entire percentages of the currency\u2019s money supply earlier in its life cycle. With Quark, the currency will take 100 years for its money supply to expand by 50%, so the 59% is not likely to go down by much any time soon. Ultimately, it is very hard to create a currency with a fair distribution model, and any specific technical approach will likely only last a few months before people with money and resources catch up to it at least to some extent. The only stable approach may be to simply premine it and then give out 0.001% to the first 100000 people that show up with a passport or at least a unique cell phone number.\nThe concerns that Quark seeks to address \u2013 Bitcoin\u2019s slow block times, the unfairness of altcoin distribution and the threat of specialized hardware \u2013 are all very valid issues, and Quark\u2019s recent success highlights the importance of these problems. However, Quark in its current state is not the solution. Litecoin and Primecoin are both very valid alternatives that seek to target many of the same goals, and have done so much more successfully. Hopefully, in time an even better cryptocurrency will be developed that will actually have all of the desired properties that we currently want; and ultimately every attempt and even every mistake made along the way is a stepping stone to achieving that goal.", "year": 2013, "month": 12, "day": 18}

Payne\u2019s piece is particularly vapid and one I didn\u2019t think worthy of response, but Karoli\u2019s is more interesting as it goes to issues of moral superiority, fantasy, and narrow-mindedness. Plus, as I say, I think Karoli is both a good writer and worth reading.\nIs Bitcoin a Libertarian Utopian Dream\nBitcoin is \u201cgenerally viewed\nBitcoin is viewed by many technologists\nBitcoin is regarded as a flawed but nonetheless worthwhile experiment\nThe only thing \u201cprofound\u201d about Bitcoin is its community\u2019s near-total obliviousness to reality\nAre there Libertarians among Bitcoin advocates? Yes, and some Anarchists too. And some merchants trying to make money. There could be some speculators wanting to get rich. There could be some social activists and human rights advocates like me among them too. But also among them there is Richard Brown, a high level technical analyst for IBM's Banking and Financial Markets Division. He described the fundamental achievement of the Bitcoin protocol as 'unimaginable' just a few years ago. Watch his remarks yourself. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDO7TDMlxsY\nThe thing is, Alex Payne, former Chief Technology Officer at Simple Bank (an online bank), writes his blog called \"Alex Payne Writes Here\". So that means he has to write something, or so he thinks. His writing reveals that he doesn't like people who have utopian ideals or who imagine a more just future. That's his real problem, not Bitcoin. And Karoli\u2019s dislike of Bitcoin is not because of any real experience or analysis; as she states at the very top, \u201cAll of the buzz around Bitcoin has disturbed me since Dan Backer filed with the FEC to allow his tea party groups to accept Bitcoin for contributions and expenditures.\u201d She doesn\u2019t like Dan Backer, therefore Bitcoin is some kind of Tea Party threat to humanity. Not exactly a sound evaluation.\nIs Bitcoin a Libertarian Utopian Dream? Maybe. Is socialism a utopian dream? Is democracy a utopian dream? Did Dr. King have a utopian dream? Maybe humanity counteracts its own evil and narrow-mindedness with utopian dreams. The lions may someday lie down with the lambs.", "year": 2013, "month": 12, "day": 23}
{"title": "Will Dogecoin Replace Bitcoin?", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/will-dogecoin-replace-bitcoin-1387827055/", "birthday": "Dec 23, 2013  2:30 PM EST", "date": "2013-12-23 19:30:00", "content": "The Bitcoin Association of Australia\n@tristan_winters\n iceCUBED\nFive years ago Saint Satoshi penned a brilliant idea. This idea was given freely to us. It has since fostered an arena where programmers cooperate, collaborate and compete to build viable alternatives. The latest entrant is Dogecoin.\nDogecoin began life as a sarcastic remark on Twitter: \u201cInvesting in Dogecoin, pretty sure it\u2019s the next big thing.\u201d After gaining traction online the idea became a reality. It has spread primarily through tipping on Reddit.\nDogecoin is a variation of the Bitcoin source code that, like Litecoin, uses Scrypt. However, with Dogecoin, the technical aspects are less interesting than the social. The technical aspects are familiar. The marketing, based on a popular meme series, is novel.\nIt has touched a nerve. Its value has soared and recently corrected. In a short space of time it has captured a large amount of value and the scenes imagination.\nDespite this flying start Dogecoin is still just a puppy. Its future is uncertain. Of course, the same can be said for all alts and Bitcoin too, albeit to a lesser extent.\nFor now Dogecoin has been most successful in holding a mirror up to the community. It is forcing us to reflect at a key point in this technology\u2019s evolution. This article\u2019s title is deliberately provocative. Dogecoin will be used as a conduit for a deeper analysis of how decentralised crypto-currency arrived at this point in history.\nBitcoin is entrenched. It is the original. All others spring from it. It is the base currency on exchange, with a multi-billion dollar market cap. It is the yardstick by which we measure the overall health of the space. It is king.\nDogecoin is the newest alt on the scene. It started life as a joke on social media. It takes a light-hearted approach to otherwise serious issues of value, finance and liberty. It is an unashamedly jolly prankster. It\u2019s young, innocent and foolish. Dogecoin is a jester.\nThe two are seemingly worlds apart. But are they really so different? They are, after-all, the same core technology. Branding and marketing are where they diverge.\nIn a world of infinite possibility what does Dogecoin need to replace Bitcoin?\nHow to build a successful alt: just add water.\nPeter Schiff and Erik Voorhees debated the viability of crypto-currency this November. During the discussion Schiff questioned whether Bitcoin would endure: a fair question. In response Voorhees pointed to the years and billions spent building the necessary infrastructure and architecture around Bitcoin.\nSuch infrastructure is key to the long-term success of any coin. But Bitcoin is not necessarily as far ahead as some would have you believe.\nBitcoin as a transaction network, up until six months ago, was very much a Satoshi Dice story. Some estimates have the game accounting for up to a half of all transactions on the blockchain. Satoshi Dice acted to drill the blockchain: testing its strength and viability as a global payment network.\nIn addition to Satoshi Dice and up until more recently, a significant number of Bitcoins were being transacted through the Silk Road. Estimates are rough and hotly debated. But the silk-road is certainly the marketplace where Bitcoin gained footing and gathered steam. The Silk Road showcased the potential of Bitcoin to the world.\nDogecoin would benefit from the addition of these two key ingredients. Indeed, there is already a Satoshi Dice clone for Dogecoin. A Silk Road clone is still lacking. One could imagine a Black Market that only accepted Dogecoin as capturing the world\u2019s imagination and securing sustained publicity.\nHowever, for a coin to have true long-term viability, still more is required. Dogecoin must foster a community around it: a clique of passionate individuals acting to build the necessary foundational layers on top of the protocol adaptation.\nGoing forward, varied implementations of the protocol are the primary foundational layer required to sustain any coin.\nCurrently there are approximately half a dozen well know implementations of Bitcoin. A healthy network requires diversity. Diversity helps to protect against vulnerability. For Dogecoin to have longevity then developers must work on implementing it. This foundational layer is fundamental to the architecture.\nIn the initial stages the rewards for such important code are not easily identifiable or guaranteed. So, to get even more reductive, Dogecoin must inspire.\nInspiration will be the lifeblood of Dogecoin. If individual actors are not inspired to work on the core code then a core group of dedicated and passionate developers will never form.\nIt goes deeper still. Individuals must be inspired to associate and cooperate to \u2018evangelise\u2019 the coin. Dogecoin will live and die by its ability to sell a raison d\u2019etre: something above immediate profit that motivates people to action. This message must be capable of sustaining momentum over time.\nDogecoin has been successful in doing this already. While conceived in jest, Dogecoin has a serious intention. As David Gilbert of the ibtimes notes \u201cDogecoin is envisioned as an anti-bitcoin\u201d now that bitcoin is increasingly \u201cseen as the plaything of serious investors and businessmen such as the Winklevoss Twins.\u201d\nThis comical approach to an otherwise serious technology is where Dogecoin has found its niche and gained traction. As Gilbert notes further, \u201cIt\u2019s not taking itself as seriously, it\u2019s not being used by people worrying about whether they\u2019ll become rich.\u201d\nThe long-term potential of this message remains to be seen. However, at this early stage, it has already showed a clear ability to inspire. Clarity of purpose is slowly and organically forming around Dogecoin. The core fan base already exists and social media traction has been achieved. A strong spring-board for next level growth now exists.\nDogecoin\u2019s core supporters must be so inspired by this message that they go forth and inspire others. Network effects will eventually take hold. A Dogecoin Jesus will certainly be required.\nA community driven by a broad unity of purpose will foster network effects that necessarily create brand recognition. Brand recognition for Dogecoin will lead to acceptance in trade. The market mechanism will then see entrepreneurs build payment processor companies. Such companies are necessary for interaction with Dogecoin.\nThe Recipe for Success\nDogecoin, to replace Bitcoin as the leading cryptocurrency, will require: 1 Satoshi Dice clone, 1 black market, 1 Dogecoin Jesus, 2 payment processors, a cohesive raison d\u2019etre (smothered lovingly with inspirational rhetoric), 3 oz. of infrastructure, a pinch of core developer talent and a splash of evangelical zeal. Place in the oven and bake at 250 degrees for 5 years. Oh yeah, don\u2019t forget to add water.\nOf course, all this assumes that Dogecoin needs to follow precisely in Bitcoin\u2019s footsteps to replicate its success. This is not necessarily true. It could blaze its own trail. However, with an analysis of the budding Bitcoin ecosystem, a formula emerges. Dogecoin would do well to follow this formula. The path has been beaten, so why not? And may this recipe inspire one thousand other tasty alts to rise.", "year": 2013, "month": 12, "day": 23}
{"title": "Fiat Versus Finance: The Centennial of the Federal Reserve versus the Rise of Bitcoins", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/fiat-versus-finance-centennial-federal-reserve-versus-rise-bitcoins-1387854183/", "birthday": "Dec 23, 2013  10:03 PM EST", "date": "2013-12-24 03:03:00", "content": "If there is an annual pre-Christmas Eve ritual in Washington, DC, and Wall Street, some invitation-only celebration within the travertine marble headquarters of one organization and several other joint ceremonies amidst banks of computer terminals, flat-screen displays and heavily carpeted floors, if such an event does exist \u2013 a December 23rd night of champagne toasts and conspiratorial communiqu\u00e9s \u2013 I do not know of it. Or, rather, I have yet to receive any such greeting.\nBut, for champions of bitcoins as a premier form of peer-to-peer digital currency, December 23rd should be the day \u2013 this year \u2013 when we draw the ultimate contrast between a mathematically-based concept, which owes its origins (in part) to the monetarist principles of the late Milton Friedman, and the moment when we can point to the calendar and say:\n\u201cThis is the day, and this is the year, one hundred years prior, when fiat triumphed over sound finance. Now is the time to reclaim the intellectual legitimacy of hard money.\u201d\nFor December 23rd marks the centennial of the birth of the Federal Reserve System, an independent central bank (with regional satellites), whose legacy \u2013 at best \u2013 is mixed. My conclusion about the Fed\u2019s record is a charitable one, considering it is only independent to a degree; it must conform to a congressional mandate (the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act), which theoretically restricts its powers, while simultaneously enjoying the right to print money with abandon. Call these actions anything you like, inveigh against their influence, condemn their legality, bemoan their short-sightedness and expose their failures \u2014 but please, never associate the Fed with anything remotely similar to a free market.\nThe Fed\u2019s wholesale printing of money, the phenomenon known as \u201cquantitative easing,\u201d is, in my opinion, an oxymoron and the single greatest act in favor of an alternative currency like Bitcoins. As to the name itself, quantitative easing, it is a misnomer because the qualifying adjective suggests there is a scientific underpinning to the policy, something calculable and definable. As in, \u201cWe know there should be x-number of dollars (\u2018M0, MB, M1, M2, M3, MZM\u2019) in circulation at any given time. If we have less than that amount we exert deflationary pressure on the economy, while anything in excess of that standard brings us into inflationary territory.\u201d The not-so-secret truth is, however, that neither the outgoing Fed Chairman nor the incoming Chairwoman (pending her Senate confirmation) knows what that amount is. And, before I finish this point, as it is a preamble in defense of Bitcoin, let me also remind readers that all of this \u2013 the statements issued by the Fed, including the oracular pronouncements of Alan Greenspan, as well as well the reactions by traders to the perceived bullish or bearish news from the Central Bank \u2014 all of this proves there is nothing quantitative or scientific about the Fed\u2019s actions or fiat money in general.\nI write these words without any partisan rancor, so put aside the politics of the Fed as an institution, and ask yourself this simple question: If the Fed\u2019s printing of money is right, as a matter of pure mathematics (meaning: the policy reconciles with an equation, which yields an expected outcome), why is there such volatility in the stock market alone, with massive upswings and sell-offs, based on no change in policy? Of course, emotion and the herd mentality play a role in the behavior of markets \u2013 man is hardly a rational creature \u2013 but if the policy is correct, rooted firmly in science, then the intended result should, after more than 5-years of \u201cstimulus,\u201d be clear: Significant economic growth, millions of new jobs and the fulfillment of Congress\u2019s requirement \u2013 legislation signed by then President Carter \u2013 that by 1988 the unemployment rate would be zero!\nNot only is the Fed not in compliance with the law, but the entire facade \u2013 including the very greenbacks and coins in our pockets \u2013 rests on a foundation of words \u2013 the \u201cFull Faith and Credit Clause\u201d of the Constitution \u2013 not numbers or any singular brand of economics. These factors make an alternative currency both inevitable and a necessity. Making the Case for Bitcoins: The Triumph of Logic The case for Bitcoins is, as described above, inevitable, accelerated by technology and modern communications. Indeed, one of Professor Friedman\u2019s more famous remarks involves his advocacy for replacing the Fed with a computer. Each year, it \u201cwould print out a specified number of paper dollars\u201d to augment the money supply. \u201cSame number, month after month, week after week, year after year.\u201d\n\u201cThe Fed has had very few periods of relatively good performance,\u201d he continues. \u201cFor most of its history, it\u2019s been a loose cannon on the deck, and not a source of stability.\u201d A spot-on assessment from a Nobel laureate with a prophetic eye in which the only change (in the 14 years since the delivery of that advice) would be to pluralize the computer to hundreds of millions of computers \u2013 server farms, fiber optic cables and data centers \u2013 linking us in one worldwide web. Welcome to the Internet, home of the peer-to-peer digital currency we call bitcoins! In not so many words: Friedman\u2019s words are right because his theory is right. The time between the issuance of the theory and the rise of bitcoins is a matter of technology, which is often the case with any scientific argument. Put another way, technology does not create a theory; it reveals and validates one. Such is the case with monetarism and bitcoins.\nSuch, too, is the case with physics, where the legendary Higgs boson (the \u201cGod particle,\u201d first theorized by Professor Peter Higgs in 1964) is now, 49-years later, verifiable \u2014 thanks to the construction of a 9-billion-dollar super collider with a 17-mile circumference. Thankfully, the proof for the necessity of bitcoins does not involve such expensive technology.\nAllow me, also, to defend Friedman\u2019s prediction without endorsing or opposing his politics. That is, the logic of monetarism, however coincidental or integral it is to the libertarian beliefs of Friedman, is its own separate entity. We need not favor abolishing the licensure of doctors or the legalization of illicit drugs, two of several longstanding arguments made by Friedman and his ideological disciples, to acknowledge and accept the closest thing to an economic scientific fact: That there is global demand for and merchant recognition of bitcoins as a legitimate, alternative currency. Communicate the Truth with Enthusiasm and Data The responsibility, for supporters of bitcoins, is now one of communications. Our duty is to popularize this phenomenon \u2013 to explain and showcase the facts \u2013 before our opponents politicize this issue with heated rhetoric and the illogic of insults, in lieu of intelligence.\nThe intensity of criticism comes from those who dismiss any kind of change. Their faith, and it is nothing more than blind allegiance, is in a single paper currency, allegedly backed by the faith of the U.S. government.\nRather, it is faith by others \u2013 in us, and the U.S., to never fail to honor our debts \u2013 that would make the most fervent adherents of monotheism blush. Critics may cite history as their shield and source of credibility, but I place my faith in the universal truth of mathematics, because history does not repeat itself \u2013 patterns of behavior recycle themselves, instead \u2013 and I recognize the difference between the two. Or, as the saying (purportedly from Mark Twain) goes: \u201cHistory does not repeat itself, but it does rhyme.\u201d Alas, a rhyme is no substitute for rhythm \u2014 and the long continuity of numbers, measurable and eternal, transcendent of the false barriers we erect against each other. A philosophical observation on my part, to be sure, but custodianship of the greatest subsection of history we know is predictable: Mathematics. Bitcoins is, in that regard, the intellectual heir to an esteemed branch of history and a solid trunk of science. The goal is to make that tree of knowledge grow, free of the weeds of ignorance and the pestilence of imprudence.", "year": 2013, "month": 12, "day": 24}

The conference took place at the MGM Grand hotel, the second largest hotel in the world, and used one large conference room seating over 1000 people and an exhibition room to host the event. Over a thousand people were present, including many of the largest businesses in the Bitcoin space. Although this was only one Bitcoin event of many in these last few months, with LaBitConf coming immediately before it, the Cryptocurrency Conference in Atlanta immediately followd by the Ripple developer event at the Future of Money conference in Las Vegas in October and the Amsterdam conference in September, over 1000 people showed up at the event \u2013 almost as many as in the first major Bitcoin conference that started the recent craze this May in San Jose.\nThere were several prominent speakers at the event:\nBobby Lee \u2013 Bobby Lee is the CEO of BTCChina, the largest Bitcoin exchange in China and now the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world. BTCChina has taken the world by storm in the past two months, with its transaction volume rising from fourth place under MtGox, Bitstamp and BTC-E to taking over first place, at the time of the conference holding a larger market share than all North American and European Bitcoin exchanges (counting MtGox even though it is based in Japan) combined. Bobby Lee spoke about the uncertain state of Bitcoin regulation in China since the recent round of Chinese regulatory announcements. Some argue that the Chinese government is only forbidding the banking system from participating in the Bitcoin economy directly and businesses could not denominate prices in BTC, while others claim that the Chinese government is forbidding businesses from accepting BTC outright, relegating the role of Bitcoin in China to purely serving as a store of value and method for buying online services from foreign and Hong Kong-based merchants; Lee took the latter position.Alan Reiner \u2013 Reiner is the CEO of Armory, a company building what is currently the most powerful and secure Bitcoin wallet including features such as a built-in elliptic curve point calculator, a paper wallet backup mechanism and offline transaction signing. Recognizing that such a wallet is of little use to the average user, Reiner has decided to make Armory target corporate users interested in securely managing large amounts of funds using complex configurations involving multisignature transactions and Shamir\u2019s Secret Sharing for security. Armory recently raised a $600,000 investment round led by precious metals guru and Bitcoin advocate Trace Mayer.Jered Kenna \u2013 Kenna is the CEO of Tradehill, a Bitcoin exchange that was the second largest in 2011, shut down in 2012 due to regulatory and banking issues, and was revived in 2013 as a Bitcoin exchange for businesses and accredited investors. At its peak, Coinbase and BitPay used Tradehill as a sort of \u201cexchange for exchanges\u201d to sell the bitcoins that they receive from users and merchants. Now, however, Tradehill has unfortunately essentially shut down, as regulatory obstacles have prevented it from getting any banking relationships. Jered Kenna\u2019s speech, however, was a very positive \u201cstate-of-the-union\u201d address on the topic of Bitcoin in general.\nAlso of interest are the businesses:\nLamassu \u2013 Lamassu was first formed by New Hampshire residents Josh and Zach Harvey in early 2013, with the goal of creating the first functional Bitcoin ATM to allow customers to buy bitcoins with cash. The company presented its first functional prototypes at the Bitcoin conference in San Jose in May, at Porcfest in June and at BTCLondon in July. Since then, Lamassu has been hard at work fortifying the machine on both the software and hardware level and making it easier to use. Very recently, Lamassu has started actually shipping out the machines to their first batch of customers at a price of $5000.KryptoKit \u2013 KryptoKit is a powerful, lightweight and easy-to-use Chrome extension that serves as an encrypted messaging app and a Bitcoin wallet. The application, built by Anthony Di Iorio and Steve Dakh starting November 2013, has attracted a large amount of media attention recently, with articles on both major Bitcoin news sites and even mainstream media websites. KryptoKit\u2019s main advantage over existing platforms such as the browser-based blockchain.info wallet and the Enigmail encrypted email plugin is the sheer level of convenience that it provides; with KryptoKit, you can pay without even leaving the browser tab that you\u2019re paying from, and the interface makes it easy for you to create and share a GPG key and seamlessly performs the encryption, signing, decryption and verification operations in the background. Although its interface is not perfect \u2013 the concept of sharing public keys, for example, is still not intuitive to most people \u2013 it is a massive step toward making a Bitcoin wallet and secure messaging app that is easy to use for the masses.Butterfly Labs \u2013 although the company had a rocky start when it first released its application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)-based mining hardware in early 2013, it is now rapidly picking up, and has recently processed an order for $1 million worth of mining hardware.yBitcoin \u2013 yBitcoin is a company releasing another Bitcoin magazine, which handed out its first issue at the conference. However, yBitcoin\u2019s magazine has a very different focus from Bitcoin Magazine; yBitcoin\u2019s magazine is not intended to cover current events or update often, and does not target existing Bitcoin users; instead, it serves as an easy-to-read introduction to Bitcoin for those who have not yet had much exposure to Bitcoin. Issues of yBitcoin magazine will also be released for free; the magazine intends to fund itself with advertising revenue.\nAltogether, the conference sent a clear message: the Bitcoin scene is getting big, fast. At the conference, one could spot not just prominent Bitcoiners, but also high-level executives of major corporations, individuals looking to buy large quantities of mining hardware, and investors walking around with millions of dollars ready to pour into whatever Bitcoin businesses they see as the most promising. Although the latest round of Bitcoin\u2019s growth may have died down somewhat, with the price stabilizing around $400-$700 following news of serious regulatory difficulties in China, the groundwork is already quietly being laid for Bitcoin businesses to make the leap to the next level. The next few conferences are going to take place in Miami in January 2014, Berlin and the Philippines in February, Austin in March, and Toronto and New York in April.

The price of a tulip, however, kept soaring to a level the next year that one tulip of a rare species was sold at 4600 Florins. Additionally, the specific buyer also gave the seller a brand new carriage, two grey horses, and a whole set of harnesses.\nEventually someone woke up, and the bubble burst. At some point when someone tried to sell or even short sell his tulip, others followed. The mania to sell was soon as much as the mania to buy. The price then crashed and hundreds of thousands of people went bankrupt.\n2. Bitcoin\nOn Nov 1 2008, someone who called himself (or herself) Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper in a private cryptography mailing list. The paper explained his or her new idea about this new e-money. On Jan 3 2009, the first fifty Bitcoins were created.\nUnlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin does not rely on the support and endorsement from central banks, governments or enterprises, but rather on the network agreement reached by those nodes which are equal to each other. The decentralized self-improving mechanism theoretically ensures that no individual, entity or government can control the total amount of Bitcoin or create inflation. Its total amount gradually increases in a preset speed which becomes slower and slower, reaching its peak at 21 million by 2140.\nOn Nov 9 2013, the price of Bitcoin soared again, recording its new high in its exchange rate against RMB. As quoted by BTCChina, the rate reached 6989 RMB, with an increase of 53.6 percent. The rate against USD also recorded a historic high of 900.89 with a 31.6 percent increase.\nMany people worry about the surging market and the soaring price discomfort, believing that Bitcoin might be another tulip mania.\n3. Things in Common Between Tulip and Bitcoin\na. Neither tulip nor Bitcoin have a universal value in use.\nb. The prices of both soared suddenly.\nc. Both have a lot of participants and discussion in the media.\nd. Neither of them is a product compulsorily made by governments.\n4. Differences\nAlthough the tulip bubble bursted, people didn\u2019t know the reason behind the burst. The essence of the collapse was not because of high prices, but because there was not enough intrinsic value within a tulip.\nThe tulip failed on its way to becoming a currency. Its attribute of commodity could not meet the requirements of being a medium of exchange or a store of value, just like seashells, horns and stones which were defeated by gold and silver.\nGiven the commodity attribute of money, the physical attribute of a tulip is not satisfactory: perishable, dis-uniform, undividable\u2026 One could barely find any function of a tulip to become a currency.\nAs a normal commodity, the use value of a tulip is limited, as it can only be viewed or planted. In other words, even if an enterprise is established to produce and sell tulips, its profit and cash flow are very limited. Not all people appreciate tulips. When the price of tulips highly exceeded the balance of supply and demand, a plummet was inevitable.\nMoney is some common commodity which originated from the barter stage of market trade. Horns, seashells and feathers had played roles of money in different places at a different time, in order to meet the two indispensable demands of the market: The store of value, and the medium of exchange.\nTo meet these two demands, the attribute of the money itself should meanwhile be:\nEasy to divide;Imperishable;Transportable;The amount can not be controlled by anyone\nThe two traits of money are being indispensable and being unique to the market. Take diamonds for example. Diamonds have value as an adornment and they also function as a store of value, given their potential to rise in price. Yet, since diamonds cannot be divided, they do not meet the demand for the medium of exchange.\nOne must have the four attributes of money to meet the two demands of the market. The fatal defect of any monetary attribute would eventually lead to the collapse of the whole system.\nThe role Bitcoin plays is a virtual currency. Unless the price of Bitcoin highly exceeds its intrinsic value of real purchasing power, the price will keep increasing. Suppose that the total amount of oil on the earth is 21 million tons. If Bitcoin can be considered money, the price of oil is 1 ton per Bitcoin. If someone gives a quote of 36 tons per Bitcoin, the purchasing power of Bitcoin is then overestimated and the price of oil is underestimated. The market can self-adjust via price discovery. The so-called liquidity shortage won\u2019t actually happen, as the market price is wrong, rather than a currency shortage. So there is no need for a central bank or a flexible currency. Before supply and demand can reach an equilibrium, Bitcoin can be unstable, and thus any soaring or plummet of price is possible.\nIn other words, if the demand of Bitcoin quickly decreases or even disappears, the price would plummet just like that of the tulip. This is when Bitcoin cannot meet the four attributes mentioned above. Bitcoin is waiting for the test and approval of the market. If the market accepts it eventually, the theoretical unit price of Bitcoin would be equal to 1/21,000,000 of the total value of Bitcoin-denominated commodities. And if the price of Bitcoin is higher than that price, it is a purchasing power bubble, which could be adjusted by the market itself.\n", "year": 2013, "month": 11, "day": 26}

The ZeroBlock App has already been a success for iOS devices. As the price of Bitcoin continues to rise, individuals can now find real time market data and news on iOS and Android devices. ZeroBlock displays real time price quotes from BitStamp, Mt.Gox, Btc-e, btcchina, and Coinbase. ZeroBlock was founded by Dan Held and Kevin Johnson in May 2013 and has become the highest rated and most reviewed Bitcoin-related app in the Apple app store.\n\nZeroBlock issued the following press release detailing the Android launch:\nZeroBlock Bitcoin App Now Available on Android Devices\nThe popular iOS app that integrates real time market data and news for serious Bitcoiners is now available on Android.\nSAN FRANCISCO,CA, November 25, 2013 \u2013 ZeroBlock today announced the launch of their Android app, which was previously exclusive to iOS devices. ZeroBlock, which combines real time Bitcoin market data with an aggregated news feed, gives users a platform for instant access to everything happening on the Bitcoin market in real time. Since the company\u2019s launch in May 2013, ZeroBlock has become the highest rated and most reviewed Bitcoin-related app in Apple\u2019s app store.\nZeroBlock recently broke 1,000,000 total app sessions and in recent weeks has been opened 30,000 \u2013 50,000 times daily by users. ZeroBlock\u2019s news aggregator scrapes from over 130 sources including reddit, bitcointalk forums, company blogs, mainstream news, and exchange blogs. Real time price quotes are provided from BitStamp, Mt.Gox, Btc-e, btcchina, and Coinbase. Blockchain information is provided from the popular wallet service, blockchain.info. Other features provided on the app include a personal holdings calculator, Clark Moody charts, and the ability to share news feed articles via Facebook, Twitter, and e-mail.\nZeroBlock\u2019s co-founders, Dan Held and Kevin Johnson, built the app out of their frustration in keeping up with the Bitcoin markets on their mobile devices. During the April price spike, they had difficulty finding mobile apps that would display the live price and relevant news feeds. So they decided to create exactly what they wanted. They built an app from scratch that would emphasize simplicity, usability, and aesthetics. Read a few reviews and you\u2019ll see the type of dedicated fan base they have. \u201cI wanted to keep a strong focus on bringing simplicity to complexity, maximizing the data to pixel ratio\u201d said Held, on his thought process when designing the app. \u201cI implemented the first x/y spatial layout for a mobile app. Utilizing the x/y screen layout, the user can swipe up, down, left and right from the main landing screen. The screen layout is similar to a plus sign. No hidden menus or unnecessary swipes. An intuitive design for an intuitive currency.\u201d They were able to iterate quickly due to Johnson\u2019s strong mobile development background. Johnson is also the head of mobile development at Ripple Labs.\nThe ZeroBlock team takes the Bitcoin mobile experience to the next level as they constantly iterate, keeping the app relevant and accurate. The company\u2019s next goal is to add more charts, data analytics, and article feeds. And in the horizon, they hope to build a tablet version for their most dedicated Bitcoiner fans.

I define acceptance here to mean that firms accept Bitcoin without instantly converting their holdings to cash (i.e. for Bitcoin to be a functional currency, rather than a marketing gimmick).Volatility is the opposite of consistency.\u00a0 Volatility is the result when the market moves for reasons other than fundamental economic or financial factors.\u00a0 At the time of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $1000.\u00a0 The sharp increase in the price of Bitcoin that has occurred in recent weeks may have been exciting for Bitcoin traders, but it makes Bitcoin look like a basket case to everyone else.Most business owners require some level of assurance that their assets will be worth the same amount over the short to mid-term.\u00a0 That is, they want to know that a dollar today will buy the same amount of goods or services next week, even if they understand and are willing to accept the idea that the same dollar\u2019s purchasing power may be diminished in the long run.\u00a0 It is true that money can be made through arbitrage or by timing conversions, but most business owners lack the motivation or expertise to become day traders in addition to whatever other business they are in.\u00a0 This is why contracts denominated in foreign currency are typically backed by contracts to guarantee the rate of exchange.In order for the Bitcoin economy to grow, merchants and consumers alike must be willing to hold Bitcoins before using them, which in turn relies on the following conditions:\n Initially, transaction costs must be lower than other forms of payment.\u00a0 This doesn\u2019t mean that Bitcoin must be free (and usually it isn\u2019t).\u00a0 However, its use must offer clear advantages over existing payment infrastructure.\u00a0 Being a cheaper alternative isn\u2019t enough.\u00a0 Most companies are willing to pay a premium for use of payment networks that are known from long experience to be secure and reliable.\u00a0 The large amount of conversion activity that is necessary at present imposes considerable transaction costs on firms looking to integrate Bitcoin into their cashflow cycle. Next, all or a large portion of a firm\u2019s vendors must accept Bitcoin in payment for goods and services.\u00a0 Alternatively, the firm must be able to maintain a healthy balance whereby the amount of assets held in Bitcoin does not grow over time out of proportion to a growth in sales.\u00a0 If this happens, then Bitcoins will be converted. After that, a firm\u2019s employees must be willing to accept at least some of their salary in Bitcoin.\u00a0 Labor costs generally make up the largest expense faced by a firm.\u00a0 Inability to pay salaries in Bitcoin would be another reason that firms would shy away from unlimited acceptance.\u00a0 Of course, employees won\u2019t accept Bitcoins if they have nowhere to spend them. Finally, in order to gain true currency, governments at all levels must eventually accept Bitcoin in payment of taxes.\u00a0 This is unlikely, since even if Bitcoin isn\u2019t ultimately deemed illegal or taxed to death, its use threatens the monopoly enjoyed by the state on the regulation of the money supply.\u00a0 However, this would not be fatal if the other conditions were met and this were the only point at which Bitcoins MUST be converted to cash.", "year": 2013, "month": 11, "day": 29}

They have to write something, anything, in order to be called writers and to be paid as writers. That\u2019s what they do. And with today\u2019s technology, what we end up with is a lot of noise. We\u2019re used to it. Nevertheless, Henry Blodget\u2019s recent column in Business Insider, while easily falling into the useless noise category, does merit some comment.\nBlodget is CEO and Editor of Business Insider, which is \u201cdedicated to aggregating, reporting, and analyzing the top news stories across the web and delivering them to you at rapid-fire pace.\u201d Ok, fine; it\u2019s about speed, not quality content. So the provocative headline \u201cBitcoin is Heading Toward a New High \u2014 and It Could Go to $1 Million\u201d is meant to be just that; provocative. It turns your head like a fast speedboat but doesn\u2019t carry a lot of valuable cargo.\nBlodget says in his column (in which he actually claims profundity) that \u201c$400 is a perfectly reasonable target for Bitcoin. As is $1,000. As is $10,000 or $100,000 or $1 million. And as is $0.01. This is because Bitcoin has no intrinsic or determinable value.\u201d He makes this claim while ignoring the underlying utility of the BTC protocol, which he himself readily admits in an accompanying video interview.\nBut in print, Blodget cannot bring himself to recognize that the intrinsic value of BTC is in the protocol as a utility. At a fundamental level, Bitcoin is a process, not a thing. He is right about the difficulty of determining value, not because it has no intrinsic worth, but because we do not know what that intrinsic value is worthin relation to existing currencies. Its value in real life can be enormous. It is like trying to determine the value of a new ability.\nObviously, almost no one, including the most skeptical, would say that the protocol has no value. It clearly does as a verifiable frictionless transactional method for any agreement, monetary or otherwise. We just can\u2019t tell what the exchange rate of BTC should be at this point because its deployment is just beginning and it is being traded against fiat currencies whose deployment is long established, currencies which are also backed by nothing except military force.\nIn print, Blodget seems to want to address BTC as if it were a commodity only, which clearly it is not. As such, he remains planted among those who proclaim no difference between Bitcoin and tulips. He ranks BTC alongside bubble assets like tulips, pogs, and beanie babies. Of course he does this to be disparaging. He does not rank it alongside our latest bubble asset, real estate, which like Bitcoin does have some obvious utilitarian value.\nYet if you dig far enough down in Blodget\u2019s writing, he says \u201cI do think the world is ready for a simple, global, electronic currency, and that Bitcoin has a shot at becoming that. But this success is the farthest thing from guaranteed.\u201d Wait\u2026 a moment ago you were comparing BTC to tulip bulbs and beanie babies. If we\u2019re talking about a \u201csimple, global, electronic currency\u201d, clearly Bitcoin is not 100% guaranteed, but it is also not \u201cthe farthest thing from guaranteed\u201d either. I would think that beanie babies would be a lot less likely to succeed with that.\nBlodget conveys his confusion by repeatedly emphasizing that (to him) it is impossible to determine BTC real value. \u201cThere is no theoretical difference between a price of $1 per Bitcoin and $1 million per Bitcoin. The only thing that will determine Bitcoin prices is what people are willing to pay for Bitcoins.\u201d That\u2019s called a free market. What is difficult (but not impossible) to arrive at is a stable exchange rate vis-a-vis traditional fiat currencies. People used to use whiskey as a medium of exchange when cash was not available or was worthless. At the time, the utility of whiskey was well understood. We are not yet at the point of understanding the full utility of Bitcoin, but it keeps increasing as we get to know it better.\nBlodget does makes some good points in that he rightly says that until Bitcoin makes more progress in adoption as a currency, it will remain mostly in the province of speculators. I agree, but the protocol is designed to be traded in small, peer-to-peer transactions and those are increasing daily. I also agree that it is impossible to know the upper limit of BTC exchange rates, and there probably will be volatility. But could it go to zero as easily as $1 million USD, as Blodget asserts? I don\u2019t think so. That depends on what BTC does and what USD does.\nBut this kind of speculation is just so much noise among people who write a lot of words for a living.\n", "year": 2013, "month": 11, "day": 28}
{"title": "Interview with Softswiss", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/interview-with-softswiss-1385618451/", "birthday": "Nov 28, 2013  1:00 AM EST", "date": "2013-11-28 06:00:00", "content": "Throughout all of 2013, gambling sites have been perhaps the single most prominent industry in the entire Bitcoin space. One of the key advantages of Bitcoin is that it makes it very easy to set up a site that handles payments, and gambling sites, which are centered entirely around sending and receiving money, are the first industry to snatch on to this massive improvement in ease of development. In 2012, we saw SatoshiDice grow from nothing to become one of the largest companies in the Bitcoin space, and in 2013 it was sold for the highest price that a Bitcoin company has ever been sold for: $12.4 million. More recently, we have seen SatoshiCircle with its in-browser roulette game, JustDice allowing users to invest in the site in the interface, and a rapidly growing number of other, smaller alternatives.\nHowever, even while we continue to play and be impressed by the rapidly growing number of options that the Bitcoin gambling scene provides, we do not often recognize the unsung heroes behind it all: the companies that actually make the underlying gambling software. Certainly, many sites are fully independent one-man operations creating a website from nothing more than a few dozen lines of code and a web server package. The more professional sites, however, such as SatoshiPoker, get their website design, layout and content from established players that have successfully been making gambling sites years before Bitcoin was born. Here, we have an interview with Ivan Montik from Softswiss, a company set up in 2009 that is responsible for the software behind several Bitcoin gambling sites. Softswiss has also, arguably unfairly, come under fire recently due to allegations that its gambling software copied that of another gambling company, VIADEN; these two pictures are perhaps the most cited evidence in this regard; in this interview, Montik also takes the time to clear up the misconceptions around this issue. More recently, Softswiss has also started to expand its involvement in the Bitcoin economy, offering its own Bitcoin payment solution, which will also be discussed in detail.\n\nVitalik Buterin: Could you introduce Softswiss to our readers? Who are the company\u2019s founders, and what are some of the products that it offers?\nIvan Montik: SoftSwiss is an IT company based in Austria. It was founded in 2008 by Ivan Montik, an entrepreneur with varied experience in economics, programming and business management. The company now employs over 30 specialists in design, mathematics and information technologies and provides high-end software products and consulting support to companies starting their way in the world of eCommerce and iGaming. The product line of SoftSwiss includes online casino platform and games, online auction software, Bitcoin payment processing solution and an online marketplace.\nVB: When did Softswiss get into developing gambling software targeting Bitcoin? What made you see the Bitcoin gambling industry as a business opportunity for your company?\nIM:The interest in Bitcoin appeared two years ago when the currency was just invented and Satoshi Dice became popular. SoftSwiss owners thoroughly followed the development and growth of the crypto-currency and were looking for the right moment to implement it in one of the projects. When SoftSwiss online casino platform was first introduced in February 2013 at ICE Totally Gaming in London, we started getting numerous requests from potential clients asking whether our software could work with Bitcoin. It was a technical challenge and at the same time a perfect business opportunity as we strongly believed in the future of Bitcoin. So we put together all our knowledge and skills and came up with a Bitcoin processing solution. We also adapted our platform and games to make them Bitcoin-compliant.\nVB: What is Softswiss\u2019s relationship with Betcoin.tm?\nIM: When Betcoin.tm first contacted SoftSwiss and asked for a possibility to launch an online casino with Bitcoin processing functionality, they already had Betcoin Circle and Betcoin Dice. They wanted to add casino to their portfolio in the shortest time frame possible and although it first sounded like a great challenge, we managed to set up the software with unique design and integrate Bitcoin payment module in just 10 days. Betcoin.tm casino was launched successfully.\nVB: Some observers have noticed that Softswiss\u2019s gaming software has some very similar graphics and sound effects to those used by VIADEN Gaming, and have conjectured that you are copying their work. Could you share your side of the story? What is your actual relationship with VIADEN, and how would you explain the similarity?\nIM: Here is a bit of history to help the readers better understand the whole issue. VIADEN is a Belarusian company which was acquired by Playtech in 2011. SoftSwiss development office is also located in Belarus and we know VIADEN founder and former owner in person. After the acquisition many team members left the company and joined SoftSwiss: 3D model developer, 2 flash developers, designer. The lead designer of VIADEN became co-founder of SoftSwiss online casino project. As a result, SoftSwiss games resemble the ones from VIADEN which is quite natural as the team have used their expertise and created SoftSwiss games in their own style. However, nothing has been copied, all games where developed from scratch and we created a completely new code based on AS3 (to my best knowledge, VIADEN\u2019s was AS2).\nThe software source code was written by SoftSwiss programmers in Ruby-on-Rails (VIADEN was using Php and C++). Mathematics is calculated by our CTO and is 100% unique. Our RNG is certified by ItechLabs.\nVB: Is there any specific evidence you can point to to assure our readers that there is no outright copying going on?\nIM: The main evidence is the unique source code. Sounds for our games were recorded by a well-known Belarusian radio host Olga Alvarado. We have the agreements with the record studio as proof that all sounds are absolutely authentic. Good personal relationship with VIADEN founder also show that there are no claims on their part.\nVB: Do you have any prominent customers in the Bitcoin gambling space aside from Betcoin?\nIM: We launched Bitcoincasino24.com among our first clients. We are launching at least 3 more Bitcoin gaming sites until the end of the year. With the growth of Bitcoin, the demand for such casinos has jumped.\nVB: I saw that SoftSwiss is coming out with a Bitcoin payment processing solution. What kinds of use cases are you targeting with this? How would you distinguish your own offering from existing Bitcoin payment processors?\nIM: Our Bitcoin payment processing solution can be used in any type of online business which accepts and makes payments to the users: online auctions, shops, ecommerce sites, even in an online hospital (we are currently working on a custom project in this area). Another curious idea suggested by a client of ours and which we would like to bring to life: Bitcoin payment solution can be used for charity! Many people are reluctant to participate in charity just because they are not sure their money goes to the desired recipient. The idea of Bitcoin payment solution solves this problem: the system allows for easy tracking of the final destination of the payment, so the person making a donation always knows where the money lands. That\u2019s a good alternative to a wire transfer.\nWhat distinguishes our solution from other providers is the increased security achieved by not using any third-party services. Storing your Bitcoin at an exchange is always risky as you are never sure the exchange doesn\u2019t close the next day. With our solution, all transactions are made to and from the operator\u2019s wallet and are immediately reflected in the balance. It is fully protected from any type of fraud.\nVB: What do you see as the future of your company? Do you intend to participate more in the Bitcoin gambling space, focus more on developing other offerings such as merchant solutions, or some of both?\nIM: While online gaming and ecommerce will definitely remain our primary focus, we would like to expand into the world of Bitcoin, improve our current solution and explore the unlimited possibilities of using it in various business areas. SoftSwiss will take part in the upcoming gaming exhibitions: RGW Minsk (http://minsk.rgweek.ru/program?language=en 15:30 I will speak about Bitcoin in Gambling), IMA in D\u00fcsseldorf and ICE Totally Gaming in London and present our solution as well as tell about Bitcoin advantages to the iGaming world. We would like to contribute to the popularity of this promising crypto-currency and become pioneers in Bitcoin-enabled online gaming.", "year": 2013, "month": 11, "day": 28}

The Studio has announced that it welcomes payment in Bitcoin, the controversial digital currency. The founder and Director of the Studio, Lunlun Zou, said she was open to any new technologies that will help promote the music and make it easier for students. \u2018We represent a very old tradition but it does not mean we cannot use the most modern technology. We intend to use whatever legal means is available to us to spread the word and the music\u2019, she said.\nBitcoin began a few years ago as a way of getting round high fees from credit card companies and banks. It is completely digital and some governments are concerned it could be used for criminal purposes, although it has not yet been banned. Ms Zou is not worried so long as it remains legal. \u2018Many things in the world can be good or bad \u2013 including music \u2013 it depends on how we use it.\u2019 She is confident the technology specialists will work things out. \u2018Our interest is simply in giving our students and customers another way to pay that may makes it easier for them.\u2019\nThe Studio is well known for teaching and performing on traditional Chinese instruments such as the guzheng, erhu and pipa.

Support A Cappella specifically emphasizes,\u201deveryone learns everything, and everything is free.\u201d\nA Cappella, similar to Bitcoin, is based on ingenuity and freedom of expression.

With many parallels, it is great to see a lead a cappella supporting non-profit now accepting Bitcoin.\nBy and large, Bitcoin is presenting more benefits than not to nonprofit and charitable organizations. What a better way to bring in donations than with Bitcoin: the most expedient payment method. Additionally, Bitcoin provides an opportunity for organizations to experience automatic growth in value as the price of Bitcoin continues to rise. Think about it\u2026 a donation made in May of this year \u2026 say of 1 BTC, would be valued at 1,000USD today, whereas it was first valued at 100USD. What an asset to charitable organizations!\nOther organizations that are taking the lead in the charitable space are Sean\u2019s Outpost and additionally the BitGive Foundation. Sean\u2019s Outpost, created by Jason King, seeks to collect donations to feed the homeless in Pensacola, FL and additionally provide awareness of the needs of individuals around the world. BitGive, similarly, seeks to help the vulnerable and just yesterday participated in Bitcoin Black Friday to seek donationsfor Philippines Typhoon Haiyan Children\u2019s Relief Fund.\nIf an organization is looking to incentivize individuals to donate to worthy causes and also provide convenience of transaction when donating, Bitcoin is certainly the solution. My hope is that in the coming days and year, an increased number of charitable organizations will accept Bitcoin as a form of payment and even send relief to those in need via the Bitcoin currency. Through Bitcoin, an organization can send funds ANYWHERE in the world to ANYONE with internet connection simply via the scan of a QR code or click of a mouse.", "year": 2013, "month": 11, "day": 30}

Ploshay (Bitcoin Magazine)\nJiangsu Telecom, a branch of China Telecom, the largest fixed line service and 3rd largest mobile telecommunication provider in China, recently announced its decision to accept Bitcoin for one of its promotion campaigns.\nBitcoin has been in the spotlight these days in China. With its soaring price and full coverage by CCTV, China\u2019s state broadcaster, Bitcoin has drawn abundant attention in the world\u2019s 2nd largest economy. Although there is no official statement from the government about the legal status of Bitcoin, one can still sense the supportive attitude from every hint released by different parties related to the government. The decision made by Jiangsu Telecom, a branch of one of China\u2019s key state-owned-enterprise (SOE), to accept Bitcoin can be considered as one more important hint from the government.\nThe news was released by Jiangsu Telecom\u2019s Weibo, a Twitter-like service in China. It encouraged Bitcoin holders in China to pay 0.1 BTC to make a reservation for a Samsung W2014 package, which includes a new Samsung mobile phone and service fee discounts. Customers who pays 0.1 BTC now can get a discounted price on the day when the package is released. The amount of the price deduction depends on the BTC exchange rate against CNY on the release day, with a promised minimal deduction amount of 500 CNY. The campaign also sets an example for Bitcoiners. If a customer pays 0.1 BTC now to reserve the package, he or she could get a deduction of 800 CNY later when the BTC exchange rate reaches 8,000 CNY. If the rate falls to below 5,000, however, the customer can still get the 500 CNY deductible.\nThe campaign is endorsed by Jackie Chan, the famous Hollywood movie star. Although Jackie Chan has endorsed products before, this endorsement and deal will most likely be a greater success. Some people are making jokes on Weibo, commenting that the government is actually using its massive destructive weapons against Bitcoin. The clear attitude of the Chinese government towards Bitcoin, however, has never been revealed. When asked about his opinion, Yi Gang, the vice president of the Central Bank of China, said that it is impossible to legalize Bitcoin in the near future in China. Sophisticated observers conclude, however, that it is actually a positive signal, as Yi put it in a way implying that the government has no intention to make Bitcoin illegal. Moreover, Yi also admitted that it is every citizen\u2019s right to purchase and sell Bitcoin. With all these comments and news, we may make an optimistic guess about the future of Bitcoin in China.\n", "year": 2013, "month": 12, "day": 3}

Above all we give thanks for networked computing: making possible our new information age. We are at the very beginning of this information era. There is a whole lot more to come and a side we are only just beginning to see, if we look hard enough.\nThe \u2018digital revolution\u2019 ushered us in. Information technologies and digital systems are now ubiquitous. The information age has necessarily given rise to the \u2018information economy\u2019. In this new economy, information is already a type of currency. But only now has currency become pure information. Indeed, with Bitcoin, value has become pure information.\nSo Bitcoin is an earth-shaking invention of the early information age, forged in mathematics. It\u2019s a creation so strange that many still struggle to come to terms with its importance. For those who have already made the leap we are forced to re-assess everything.\nBut remarkable as Bitcoin is, it leads to an even more profound conclusion: that wealth too is information. And, as such, it can now exist entirely in one\u2019s own head. From this remarkable idea we draw the most glorious of designs: the \u2018Brain Wallet\u2019.\nIt\u2019s the best thing yet to come out of the Bitcoin space. A new generation of libertarians are daring to contemplate what was once thought impossible.\nA Brief Definition:\nA brain wallet is simply a unique, memorisable pass-phrase from which all private keys (and therefore Bitcoins) can be restored. The best current example is the Electrum wallet.\nAnyone, anywhere, can download this free piece of software. By remembering 12 simple words a users wealth effectively exists only in that users head. It is simple in use but complex in design: a truly powerful concept.\nConsider then, how is the state to confiscate wealth in this new information age?\nTragedy and a Thought Experiment:\nIn Hitler\u2019s Germany, according to historian Gregg J. Rickman, \u201cwhen it came to robbing Jews, very little was missed\u201d. This is the most extreme example in modern history of a state gone mad.\nEverything was confiscated, \u201cJewish bank accounts, insurance policies, securities, jewellery, property, businesses, pensions, art wine, books, manuscript and stamp collections\u2026clothes, shoes, hats, household and business goods\u201d, all taken by a tyrannical state.\nAll these things were goods: physical representations of \u2018wealth\u2019. In the case of bank accounts, the wealth was a claim on the ledger of a central body: easily seized by tyrants. Likely this wealth was earned over generations. Only to be gone in an instant of despotic madness.\nIn the pre-information age we could only rely on the physical world to represent wealth. That is all. As a result we were vulnerable to the tyranny of state. In the information age we have a new paradigm: the digital.\nNow we can not only denominatewealth digitally, but also have it exist entirely in the digital realm. It\u2019s a grand concept. And it\u2019s here now.\nA Modern Context:\nIn November the Bitcoin Foundation went to Washington. During this visit congress was formally introduced to crypto-currency.\nThe community watched with baited breath as the US began the process of learning Bitcoin. The same community was taken-a-back by a fairly benign response. Washington decided it would take no immediate action. For now, it would wait and watch.\nOf course, it was clear that no one really understood the broader implications. As senator Carper put it, \u201cI understand the words, but not the sentences.\u201d\nFor the apparatus of state realisation will be a long process. It will dawn over time. For now they play the sheep. As they necessarily continue the wealth confiscation process they will reveal themselves as wolves.\nContinued wealth confiscation is a certainty for the US and much of the Western World. Currently it is less brutal than the Nazi version. But it is a longer, more insidious process: a slow grind.\nThe future obligations of the US Federal Government are enormous. It has promised its citizens hundreds of trillions of dollars in welfare benefits, well into the future. To pay for these promises it has two options: print money or increase taxes. Both options are limited. You can\u2019t tax more than 100% and you can\u2019t print money forever.\nAs we gradually approach the conclusion of these two options the state will be left with no other choice. Direct confiscation and capital controls are coming. To some extent they have already begun.\nThere is already precedent for this in US history. In 1933 President Roosevelt exercised an obscure piece of authority. Bank safety deposit boxes were seized. Trade of gold and silver was prohibited. US citizens were ordered to hand over precious metals to the Federal Government.\nConfiscation in the information age will be a challenge. The state will require new methods worthy of digital wealth.\nThought Police and Torture \u2013 Our Orwellian Future:\nComputing advancements to brute-force hack pass-phrases will be met with equal development from hackers. This will be a difficult path for the State.\nAs a result, the state will necessarily resort to torture or \u2018thought police\u2019. These are their only viable options for wealth confiscation. The state is hard out of luck. With the brain wallet the information age has truly taken it up a gear.\nNevertheless, technology itself has no moral compass. It can\u2019t. Only we can. The same advancements in science that provide for brain wallets also make mind reading possible. Thought police are an inevitable part of our future.\nResearch is already being conducted to extract images from subject\u2019s minds. Even now we are able to hear a person\u2019s internal monologue. This technology is primitive, but it exists.\nIn a perverse tit-for-tat, the State will continue to develop technology to read our thoughts and confiscate digital wealth. Hackers will also continue to develop technology for the people, to protect that same wealth.\nAs for torture, well that requires no technology. While restricted by constitutions, laws and international agreements these are only bits of paper. The state can and most likely will simply ignore those, as it has in the past.\nA Great Hope:\nTo quote Arthur C. Clarke, \u201cAny sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from divinity\u201d. We are entering a period of ideas unfathomable to even our parents. In some sense we already possess the power of the divine.\nBitcoin is one of these ideas. It is a technological marvel. As such it will necessitate equal technological marvels from states wishing to profit from our labour.\nThe information age is only just beginning. The majesty of this moment is tremendous.

{"title": "Using Bitcoin With Quickbooks- Part 1: Recording Sales and Accepting Payments", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/using-bitcoin-with-quickbooks-part-1-recording-sales-and-accepting-payments-1385976677/", "birthday": "Dec 2, 2013  4:31 AM EST", "date": "2013-12-02 09:31:00", "content": "\n\nThis is the first part of a multi-part series that will explain how to integrate Bitcoin as a payment method using your existing small business accounting software package.Why would you need to do this?In short, because accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and state and federal regulatory authorities require reporting in US Dollars.This procedure will allow you to properly account for the full extent of your Bitcoin sales and integrate those sales into your business records as if they had originally been made in your home currency.\nSince the vast majority of small business owners use a version of Intuit QuickBooks, this series will refer to that product (specifically the 2014 version).The concepts will be the same regardless of what software or version you use, though the implementation may vary somewhat.I assume as a pre-requisite that you have a basic knowledge of financial accounting, that you are familiar with your accounting software package and that the amounts that you record are determined with reference to US Dollars.\nStarting in 2009, most US desktop versions of QuickBooks featured native multi-currency support.This function can be activated from the preferences menu and allows rates to be automatically updated from the internet.The QuickBooks file has a default or \u201chome\u201d currency and then tracks as many other foreign currencies as needed, with the functional currency set by vendor, customer, or account.\nUse of the multi-currency feature comes with a few caveats- First, QuickBooks will only update currencies automatically when the home currency is US Dollars so this feature may not work well for users outside the US.Second, add-ins like Statement Writer and Fixed Asset Manager will only work with US Dollars, meaning financial statements cannot be denominated in Bitcoin if you choose to hold them as an asset.Finally, QuickBooks does not integrate with many of the Bitcoin intermediaries in common use at this time.Thus, billing and collection would require an extra step even if you did use multi-currency.For these reasons, this procedure does not make use of multi-currency support.\nAs of the fall of 2013, Bitpay.com supported ledger downloads in Intuit Interchange File format (.iif).Though this may save some data entry work if your business has considerable Bitcoin transaction activity with Bitpay, you will still need to create the accounts in QuickBooks to classify your transactions.If there is a demand for it, I will address how Bitpay and QuickBooks interact in a later article, though Bitpay\u2019s website already does a good job of this.\nTo book Bitcoin sales in QuickBooks:\n1.First, record sales as normal, using the programmed workflow in QuickBooks (either \u201ccreate statements\u201d or \u201ccreate invoices\u201d) in your functional currency (USD, Euro, etc.).If you request funds using Coinbase, Bitpay, BIPS, or another payment service provider, you may want to select the option bill with reference to your functional currency instead of directly in Bitcoin in order to reduce your exchange risk.\n2.Before recording payment, you will need to add two new accounts to your company\u2019s chart of accounts (you only need to add these accounts once).From the home screen, select \u201cChart of Accounts\u201d, then select the \u201cAccount\u201d tab and click \u201cNew.\u201dThe first account will be an \u201cOther Current Asset\u201d account (under \u201cOther Account Types\u201d) called \u201cBitcoin\u201d (or \u201cBitcoin Wallet\u201d or whatever works for you).The tax line mapping will be \u201cnot tax related.\u201dThe second account will be an income account called \u201cBitcoin Exchange Gains.\u201dThe tax line mapping will be \u201cother income.\u201dYou may also want to add an expense account called \u201cBitcoin Exchange Losses\u201d, though gains and losses generally should net out and show up as a single line item on your Profit and Loss statement.Close the chart of accounts.\n3.Add Bitcoin as a payment method.From the home screen, select the \u201cReceive Payments\u201d function (also accessible from the Customers menu).On the \u201cCustomer Payment\u201d screen, select the \u201cMore\u201d button adjacent to the cluster of payment method buttons.Then select \u201cadd new payment method.\u201dThe new payment method will be called \u201cBitcoin\u201d of type \u201cCash.\u201dSelect \u201cOk.\u201d\n4.To record a payment on account in Bitcoin, click the \u201cReceive Payments\u201d button and select the customer from the \u201cReceived From\u201d menu.Input the amount received in dollars.This should be the same amount that you billed, even if the exchange rate fluctuated between billing and receipt, or else QuickBooks will show an unresolved debit or credit balance on the customer\u2019s account.Click the \u201cMore\u201d payment method button (looks like a plus sign), then select \u201cBitcoin.\u201dIn the \u201cDeposit To\u201d box, select the other current asset account you created to track your Bitcoin Wallet.Your customer should now show payment in full for the associated invoice.\nThis procedure is just one of several possible ways to record Bitcoin sales in QuickBooks and less complicated that some of the others out there.Since you are already using the regular QuickBooks workflow, you should have no problems with your Cost of Goods Sold or Accounts Receivable showing weird balances (they will be denominated in dollars, just as you recorded them).Always remember to record sales and payments in QuickBooks using the \u201cCreate Invoices\u201d and \u201cReceive Payments\u201d functions.Not doing so may result in misclassification or underreporting of income, unapplied customer payments and other undesired results.\nThe next part of the series will be \u201cRevaluing Your Wallet and Converting to Cash.\u201dFeel free to contact me with feedback, questions, or requests.\nCover photo by flickr user BTCKeyChain.Used under Creative Commons license at: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en", "year": 2013, "month": 12, "day": 2}

Through an SBIR or Small Business Innovation Research grant to the Department of Defense, Utica New York based Critical Technologies Inc. has been working on a commercial product for the Air Force since applying for the grant back in 2012 (starting Fiscal Year 2013). Coincidentally, the Bitcoin Foundation began its grant proposal process in 2012 and also awarded its first grant in 2013.\nSBIR further explains explains its grant program for small business conducting federal research and R&D on its website:\n\u201c{Grants are for} Federal Research/Research and Development that has the potential for commercialization. Through a competitive award process, SBIR enables small businesses to explore their technological potential and provides the incentive to profit from commercialization. By including qualified small businesses in the nation\u2019s research and development (R&D) arena, high-tech innovation is stimulated, and the United States gains entrepreneurial spirit as it meets its specific R&D needs.\u201d\nCritical Technologies was granted awards totaling $899,611 for Phase I [Mirror]\u00a0(technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential) and Phase II\u00a0[Mirror] (commercial potential proposal) for \u201cRemote Attestation and Distributed Trust in Networks (RADTiN).\u201d Phase II began on August 5th, 2013 and will continue through August 4th, 2015 before the Air Force decides whether or not to pursue commercialization objectives of phase II. However, SBIR does not fund Phase III awards. Phase III could potentially involve a contract directly with the Air Force but that remains to be seen.\nThe proposal has a lot of jargon such as \u201c$SWAP constraints\u201d and acronyms such as IoTaP (Internet of Things and People), MANET (Mobile ad hoc network), DAA (Direct Anonymous Attestation) and DAM3ON (Distributed Attestation for Mobile, Multicast & Multiple Operator Networks) that left me a bit flummoxed.\nHowever, it was not difficult to find the objective behind this project:\n\u201cThe goal is secure and trusted transactions in a distributed Network Centric Operations environment.\u201d\nNetwork Centric Operations, also known as \u201cNetwork-centric warfare\u201d is a type of military war theory pioneered by the Department of Defense. The Air Force\u2019s military networking gateway for network-centric warfare known as BACN or Battlefield Airborne Communications Node, recently finished 5,000 combat missions. \u201cEssentially, the BACN system has the capability to enable a soldier on the ground to use a cell phone to text message jet fighter and bomber pilots operating in his area\u201d explained John Keller in Military & Aerospace Electronics Magazine when the technology was first being deployed.\n\nImage Credit: Bitcoin not Bombs\nGetting back to the Air Force\u2019s Bitcoin payment gateway, the award states that the project could enable a trusted gateway between bitcoin wallets and point of sales machines which would most likely include cash registers and vending machines:\n\u201c..the most unique commercialization opportunity is in the emerging digital currency/commerce marketplace. Using the team\u201ds already existing reputation (as the enablers of the world\u201ds first BitCoin/vending machine transaction) and relationships, the RADTiN/DAM3ON software will be demonstrated as a key enabling technology for the establishment of trust and the security of transactions between digital wallets and physical point-of-sale machines. The key to penetration in this emerging marketplace is to maximize automation (ease of operation), verified security of your smartphone and digital wallet, and trust in the sales machine, the protection of your data in motion (to the machine) and at rest (in the cloud). The ability to clearly attest to the security of your smartphone, your digital wallet, and your data before, during, and after the transaction will be of interest to the firms attempting to broaden this emerging economy. The demonstration of this technology will allow the team entry into these diverse marketplaces, and represent a unique potential commercialization opportunity for a DoD SBIR research effort.\u201d\nWhile Bitcoin is a trustless\u00a0payment protocol, as layers are added to Bitcoin there is an increasing need for Bitcoin users to be able to trust the systems they are using. This technology appears to bridge this widening gap in trust.\nNo Stranger to Bitcoin\nWhile I don\u2019t think this means that combat troops will be beaming bitcoin to (and from) B52 bombers any time soon, there are some interesting connections between Bitcoin and the military industrial complex.\nThe Bitcoin Project at Bitcoin.org promotes that Bitcoin could potentially be used by the military by stating that \u201cBitcoin transactions are secured by military grade cryptography.\u201d This is a reference to the SHA-256 hash algorithm. Moreover, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) issued a mandate which requires federal agencies to stop using SHA-1 certificates, effective January 1, 2014 (PDF). Department of Defense posted (PDF) its SHA-256 migration plans back in March 2011.\nFurther, the Critical Technologies grant states that:\n\u201cWarfighters need to be able to trust the systems on which their lives depend. Cases include an individual human trusting an individual computer, an individual computer trusting a server or network to which it is connecting, a server or network trusting an individual computer connecting to it, and (new here) one network trusting another with which it is inter-connecting.\u201d\nStuart Card, PhD and Chief Scientist of Critical Technologies describes Critical in his LinkedIn profile:\n\u201cWe develop and apply dual-use (military & commercial) technologies in the intersection of mobile wide area wireless, storage and sensor networking, ensuring high QoS, reliability and security of services despite resource constraints (think RAID, but across multiple communications, storage and sensor resource types). Lately we have begun work to bring the benefits of digital cash (e.g. Bitcoin) and true free markets to individuals and small organizations on the Internet.\u201d\nMr. Card is no stranger to Bitcoin. On January 5th, 2012 Upstate Networks, Inc. (UNI) developer of BTCVend and DroidVend, released a proof of concept demonstration of the first-ever vending machine purchase using Bitcoins (with change returned in U.S. dollars).The video released on Youtube, shows Mr. Card purchasing a bag of popcorn using a QR code and a smartphone Bitcoin wallet.\n[youtuber youtube=\u2019http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDOcLros-w0\u2032]\nThe Military Industrial Complex\nWhile it is uncertain exactly how the Air Force would use a bitcoin payment gateway there is certainly a need for the military to have the ability to use any currency in the theater of war.\nThis Youtube video from Air Combat Command \u201cFinance Unit Deploys to Iraq\u201d explained how the Air Force Financial Management Detachment joined the Army by filling joint taskings. An article\u00a0from Grand Forks Air Force Base from May 2011 further explains how the Air Force finance units were used to transfer currency in \u201cAirman delivers cash, military pay services to Soldiers at austere locations.\u201d\nThere is a really interesting U.S. Army Command and General Staff College Textbook, Text ST 63-1, Division and Corps Logistics (1997), supporting core logistics instruction in the Command and General Staff Officers Course which explains\u00a0in the chapter \u201cSustaining Soldiers and their Systems\u201d that \u201cCurrency is like another class of supply, a commodity required to execute the battle\u201d:\n\u201cFinance units disburse currency (cash/money) to battlefield commanders. Currency is like another class of supply, a commodity required to execute the battle. This commodity can alleviate shortages and timing problems related to procuring various classes of supply and services within the AO. Because of this, finance units can be a significant force multiplier. Therefore, finance unit commanders must be prepared to meet the twin challenges of providing support and surviving on the battlefield.\u201d\nIt also explains how the finance unit provides \u201cbanking and currency support\u201d:\n\u201c\u2026. Currency support includes supplying US currency, foreign currencies, US Treasury checks, foreign military scrip, military payment certificates, and in some operations, precious metals (gold, silver) to US forces and allies in the theater. Because of the US and allied forces\u2019 operating requirements, limited banking support may be needed. Liaison with the HN banking industry is essential due to the dependence on foreign currency.\u201d\nAs well as the responsibility to \u201dcontrol currency in the battlefield\u201d:\n\u201cStringent controls are enforced on the amounts of US currency, military payment certificates, and foreign currencies available and used on the battlefield. This is necessary to reduce black market activities, to secure individual soldiers\u2019 money, and to help control problems related to either US or HN currency inflation.\u201d\nUS currency controls have in part been addressed by prepaid access cards (also known as stored value cards) called Eagle Cash Cards. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, U.S. Central Command quoted\u00a0Juan DeJesus, a Department of the Army Eagle Cash manager in Military.com article \u201cEagle Cash Helps Manage Money\u201d:\n\u201cThe Eagle Cash card is \u2026 helping the military save money because it is expensive to transport U.S. currency overseas and costs money to provide security for the currency while in flight.\u201d\nand further:\n\u201cEvery time a servicemember spends U.S. dollars in the Middle East theater, it\u2019s potentially helping fund terrorism because the U.S. dollar has stronger market value in this region.\u201d\nA Tangled Web We Weave\nWhile some might be surprised to learn the government is investing in a \u201cbitcoin startup\u201d like Critical Technologies, the military has been involved with more controversial financial technology. Perhaps most memorable in recent times was the so called \u201cterrorism futures market.\u201d In 2001, DARPA began experimenting with \u201cmarket-based concepts to intelligence.\u201d This included DARPA\u2019s FutureMAP (Future Markets Applied to Prediction) which used prediction markets to predict terrorist attacks. DARPA, otherwise known as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, commissions advanced research for the Department of Defense. Prediction markets should be familiar to those of you who follow bitcoin pundit Max Keiser who started one of the first, if not the first prediction market with HSX (Hollywood Stock Exchange) which he received patents for (including patents for virtual currencies).\nThe government\u2019s use of currency in military operations was also exposed in Peter Joseph\u2019s documentary Zeitgeist with the John Perkins \u201cConfessions of an Economic Hitman\u201d interview (extended video interview). If conspiracy theories are your thing, look no further than Reddit user nicolaosq\u2019s controversial post in the r/conspiracy subreddit \u201cBitcoin was created by DARPA.\u201d\nFinal Thoughts\nWhile it is possible that the Air Force specifically wants a Bitcoin payment gateway with RADTiN, it is also possible what they are really after is a better way to feed Snickers bars (YouTube) to their servicemen. But in all seriousness, the grant and Critical Technologies seem to indicate that RADTiN is a dual use technology. That is to say, it is possible that its use as a Bitcoin payment gateway is incidental to its use with Network Centric Operations. While RADTiN can be used as a Bitcoin payment gateway, this within itself is not necessarily the reason why SBIR issued the grant.", "year": 2013, "month": 12, "day": 2}

Living in a squat definitely lacks a certain appeal to many, but with the removal of vanity comes much more focus on enabling social action.For Dark Wallet, MACAO was to be a platform to introduce and educate the public on how Bitcoin and similar technologies can introduce a dismantling of the corruption we call \u201cgovernment\u201d.\n\nTo be clear, there was little-to-no organization.

So it went for the first few days as visitors trickled in, but it wasn\u2019t long before trips to the market were being coordinated and full meals were being prepared by and for the entirety of the crew.\n\nCan\u2019t cook? There\u2019s always dishes and trash detail. Without a single appointed or elected official, the community with thriving with minimal conveniences. This self-organization is a libertarian\u2019s dream of the future of communities. There were no rules\u2014all you have to survive on was your merit.\nAs the week marched on, Bitcoin ideals abounded, with smoke-laced discussions on the depths of anarchism often entering into our collective conversation. Discussions ranged from the ultra technical to the ephemeral, from hallways to desks to couch. Everyone spoke with everyone in every possible permutation of English, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Romanian.\nAlong the way, there have been some exciting moments, including a visit from Cody Wilson & his tagalong cameraman, the excitement of breaking the $1000 barrier, and celebrating the success of Sean\u2019s Outpost and Satoshi Forest with Jason King. To say this is a unique event would be a massive understatement and the excitement inside our event reached a fever pitch when Richard Matthew Stallman, founder of GNU Project, came to stay in the very squat we called home.\nIn retrospect, the week was far more about the sharing of ideas and honing of goals. Dark Wallet set out to create special software, but stands to have more far-reaching effects on Bitcoin software as a whole with hopeful implications for all humans. As the week closes out, we stand with a platform before us, ready for implementation.\n", "year": 2013, "month": 12, "day": 3}

Why would you need to do this? Because generally accepted accounting principles and regulatory authorities require reporting in US Dollars and other conventional currencies. This procedure will allow you to properly account for the full extent of your Bitcoin sales and integrate those sales into your business records as if they had originally be made in your home currency.\n\u00a0\nYou will need to record changes in the value of your Bitcoin wallet from time to time to account for variations in the exchange rate. You will use a journal entry for this.\n\u00a0\n\nSelect \u201cMake General Journal Entries\u201d from the \u201cCompany\u201d menu. General journal entries must have two equal parts- a debit and a credit.\nFrom the account menu on the general journal entry screen, you will select two accounts- the Bitcoin Wallet other asset account and the Bitcoin Exchange Gains income account that you created earlier.\nTo increase the balance, post a debit for the amount of the increase to your asset account and an equivalent credit to your income account. To decrease the balance, post the decrease amount to your income account as a debit and an equivalent credit to your asset account. For example, the journal entry for a $100 change in the value of your Bitcoin holdings will look like this:\n\nFor Increase\nAccount Debit Credit\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Bitcoin Wallet $100\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Bitcoin Exchange Gains $100\nFor Decrease\nAccount Debit Credit\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Bitcoin Exchange Gains $100\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Bitcoin Wallet $100\nEventually, you will want to convert your holdings to dollars or you may want to convert some of your dollars to Bitcoins. You can use another journal entry for this. You will need to account for any fees that you pay for the exchange. This example assumes a $1 transaction fee, accounted for using a service charge general ledger account, but you can create a new general ledger account for this if you want. The journal entry will look like this:\nConversion to dollars\nAccount Debit Credit\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Cash (or Bank Account) $100\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Bank Service Charges $ 1\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Bitcoin Wallet $101\nConversion from dollars\nAccount Debit Credit\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Bitcoin Wallet $100\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Bank Service Charges $ 1\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Cash (or Bank Account) $101\n\u00a0\nBitcoin exchange gains are taxable as income for business taxpayers and individuals (more on this in a later post). This procedure will post all of your gains and losses to one account which will allow you to declare your gains or deduct your losses at the end of your fiscal year. Note that for tax purposes you will not need to declare income and cannot claim any loss until you convert Bitcoin to dollars (\u201crecognize when realized\u201d). If you are a full or part time Bitcoin trader, you may want to use an equity account to track your unrealized gains or losses as you revalue your wallet over time. As always, this is one of several ways to account for this kind of transaction in QuickBooks. Other procedures may work equally well.\nThe next part of the series will be \u201cPaying Vendors.\u201d Feel free to contact me with feedback, questions, or requests.\nCover photo by flickr user BTCKeyChain.

Strong activity from KNC Miner, Gyft, and Amagi Metals led the increase.\nDuring the Bitcoin Black Friday event on November 29, BitPay processed 6,296 bitcoin transactions in a single day, making it the most popular day in the history of bitcoin commerce. On November 29, more than 6% of all transactions on the bitcoin network were spent on goods and services through BitPay\u2019s platform.\n\u201cBitPay\u2019s order volume is the most accurate indicator of the real bitcoin economy, and today that economy is soaring higher as merchants are seeing tremendous value in accepting bitcoin payments,\u201d states Tony Gallippi, BitPay Co-founder and CEO. \u201cWe are building the most powerful, reliable, and scalable tools for businesses to accept bitcoin.\u201d\nLast year, the Bitcoin Friday event was BitPay\u2019s largest volume day in 2012 and the company processed 99 transactions.

{"title": "Currency Competition and Hoarding", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/currency-competition-and-hoarding-1386112654/", "birthday": "Dec 3, 2013  6:17 PM EST", "date": "2013-12-03 23:17:00", "content": "Written By: BigChubbyCat (8BTC)\nTranslated By: James Choi (8BTC)\nEdited By: Elizabeth T. Ploshay (Bitcoin Magazine)\nI. The difference among physical carriers\nBefore discussing currency competition, we should define the difference between different monetary carriers.\n1. Carriers for precious metal money: metal atoms (Au, Ag, Pt, etc)\n2. Carriers for paper money: some mixture of plant fiber\n3. Electronic money: electronics\nThere have been other forms of carriers in the past. For example, past carriers of horns, seashells and feather money were parts of animals, which are essentially protein and calcium. Carriers of different physical natures compete against each other. Competition results from human behaviors such as selecting, comparing, eliminating and hoarding.\nAdditionally, compulsory enforcement is also a human behavior, which does have an impact on the result of selecting monetary carriers. However, compulsory enforcement itself is not competition. The currency competition I will refer to, is market competition based on voluntary activity by each individual. The different physical natures of monetary carriers lead to currency competition, which also applies to carriers of the same physical nature. Precious metal money competes against paper, and paper money against electronic money. Different currencies also compete against each other under the form of the same carrier. For example, metal carriers like copper, gold, silver, and aluminum have played the role of monetary carriers at different phases in history. Humans cause currency competition, namely through mining technology, the process of smelting and forging, etc. There are often different forms of the same metal with subtle competitions, like gold bricks of regular shape, gold bullions of irregular shape, more standardized gold coins, etc.\nII. The Differences of Origin\nFrom the perspective of the origin of money, there are two types of money:\n1. Free money, which is chosen spontaneously by the market. Examples include gold, silver, platinum, Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ripple, etc.\n2. Fiat money, whose acceptance is mandated by the government.\nIII. Currency Competition\n1. Free money (precious metals) VS fiat money (paper money)\nThis game has already ended and the winner has come out. Sadly a lot of people, however, are still not aware of the result. The collapse of the Bretton Woods system and the monetary history itself have told us the fact that paper money did not win. The great influence of positivism and the weird logic of I think therefore I am, however, has twisted the cognition of many individuals, who still think that the paper money we use today has defeated gold and silver through fair market competition.\nOne with any historic common sense would not agree on such incorrect opinions which result from a misunderstanding of the definition of competition. Many get confused between the concept of competition and unscrupulousness. Currency competition, as a matter of fact, refers to the voluntary selection through the free market, which excludes the compulsory intervention by non-market factors.\n2. Competition Among Free Money\nA. Competition among precious metal currencies\nThere is competition between gold, silver and platinum. In the era of metal money, the most popular monetary carriers were gold and silver. Today, platinum has become ornamental due to its inferior physical nature (less flexible than gold or silver) and the difficulty to mine platinum. Platinum can be considered one of the losers in this currency competition, along with iron and aluminum.\nThe metal money competition has two winners, namely gold and silver, which is also revealed in the choice of central banks and individual savings accounts holding gold and silver. The existence of paper money is nothing about competition, but mandatory acceptance, caused by two totally different processes.\nAlthough gold and silver meet the standard of four basic monetary attributes, they still have some tiny (not fatal) defects, relating to divisibility and transportability.\nDivisibility. Both gold and silver can be easily cut into small sizes, but there are limits in the cutting. Gold must be large enough to be seen and carried by individuals. This defect is not fatal and may be fixed by alternative option, namely silver. Just like the units of length where lightyear and nautical mile are not suitable for daily life and the Metric system is, when the minimal unit of gold can not meet the demand, silver may be used for settlement.\nTransportability. Metal money is not suitable to carry for long-distance and in large quantities. Payment via electronic process through bank systems, on the other hand, may repeat the failure of the fractional reserve system.\n3. Competitions among crypto currencies\nThere are almost no obstacles in the cutting of electronic currencies, as one can simply divide a Bitcoin into 10 0.1B or 100 0.01B. The electronic transfer is so convenient that there can be a zero transaction fee.\nThis advantage comes with the cruelty of competition, as probably no more than one crypto currency will in the end survive under the impacts of adhesiveness, network effect and power laws competition. The cruelty is bidirectional, as not only Litecoin or Ripple but also Bitcoin itself are under such pressures. As long as the development of Bitcoin goes against any basic monetary attribute, it will collapse soon. It is a cruel selection of winner-take-all. But it all depends on the choice of the market, which is voluntary and spontaneous.\nIV. The Collaboration Among Parallel Currencies\nHowever, the market relationship among currencies is not purely \u201ccruel competition\u201d. A cryptocurrency is not a perfect solution, neither is a precious metal currency. Both have some monetary attributes that the other need, and both are free money whose total amounts cannot be controlled.\nCryptocurrencies can cover the mentioned defects of precious metal currency, with better divisibility, better transportability and quicker payment, while the latter can cover the market that the former could not reach, namely locations without network or equipment, people unable to learn about cryptocurrencies, and places without electric power, etc. The market will spontaneously find the exchange rate accepted by both sides, like 1BTC = 15g silver. As long as the market accepts it, cooperation can be reached.\nV. The theory of scarce currency is wrong\nIf a substance becomes money, there is no such thing as scarcity, as the monetary attributes require the substance to be infinitely divisible. If a substance is scarce, it cannot be turned into money.\nThe scarcity of currency is a false statement. It mixes up some basic economic concepts, namely money, commodity and price. Money itself is a commodity. To become money, however, this commodity must have the attribute of infinite divisibility, or it will be replaced. When the requirement of its monetary attributes are met, there is no scarcity of currency in this commodity. Since it is infinitely divisible, the total amount of this currency would not be scarce, no matter how the total amount of commodities and services change, or how the population and economy develop. Money is what the economy uses to store value, so when it plays the role of exchange medium, it is the money itself that decides the price, not the other way around.\nThe total amount of money is the important factor in deciding the price. Price itself cannot threaten the total amount of money, since it is the wrong price and would be rejected by the market. For example, let\u2019s assume that there were only 50 tons of gold in the era of the gold standard. The 50-ton-gold would be the decisive factor for price for people to trade in the market. If somebody sold something at the price of 51 ton of gold, scholars who mix up the concepts tells us that currency is scarce.\nClearly, anyone with common sense knows that this deal is impossible to make. The price is senseless and incorrect, let alone when the competitors of the seller would jump in and lower the quote. Even when there is no competitor, the price is still invalid, simply because no one could afford to buy it. So if people agree on the theory of scarce currency, they will accept the compulsory power that manipulates the market and price. Due to the incorrect price, people give up on honest gold and choose paper money which has in essence, a limitless supply. Finally, the currency is no longer scarce, thanks to selfless central bankers who offer their help.\nThis is not the truth, however. This is just the logic always held by the positivist. As a measurement for price, the purchasing power of money itself is only a reflection of the commodity trading in the market. The oversupply of commodities leads to the decrease of price and those who expand recklessly get punished, yet those who expand reasonably can provide cheap yet qualified service. The whole process results from human behavior instead of a simple mathematical function. First, only some people expand recklessly. Secondly, when the losers quit the market, the price will stop and fall and the economic cycle will make people look for more reasonable investment and thus recession ends. Thirdly, both consumers and suppliers are human beings, whose behaviors cannot always be calculated and predicted precisely by mathematical constants.\nTherefore, the success and the failure of an economy, as well as its prosperousness and recession, are caused by human beings. To end a recession, the spontaneous adjustment from human behavior is surely needed. Ending a recession has nothing to do with money. The economy is like a car and money the tree beside. It is the human who drives and brakes the car, although the faster the car is running forward, the faster the tree seems to be behind at a distance. One should understand the relative reference of physical movement, rather than that of backward movement of the tree which drives and provides power for the car.\nThus, it can be concluded that neither money nor central banks help the economic cycle. Does one really believe we should adjust the backward policy of the tree to keep the car driving? A good driver should not pay attention to the tree outside the car, or a car accident may happen. A good economy should not pay attention to its money, and neither should it manipulate the money or interest rate because what is caused by man should be solved only by man.\nVI. Gresham\u2019s Law is wrong.\nThe traditional understanding about Gresham\u2019s Law is wrong, yet it is still used to explain the elimination of gold and silver by paper money.\nThis law is also called, \u201cthe law of bad money drives out good.\u201d People tend to keep the money of better commodity value and spend money of inferior commodity value. At the end of the day, the market is full of the bad money and good money is out of circulation. People who don\u2019t think themselves, will easily accept this point of view, yet it only describes something that really could never happen.\nNobody can hoard good money and spend bad money forever. If one will not accept bad money, then how will many others accept it long term. This logic can be applied to the paper money we use today. Many would like to spend broken paper money first and keep unbroken money. Yet, we also know that you can\u2019t do that forever. As market participants, others would not accept broken paper money either, which means the so-called Gresham\u2019s Law could not last for long. In contrast, sellers with superior commodities hold a dominant position in price negotiation and they will only accept good money, forcing others to pay in good money.\nThe essential problem of Gresham\u2019s Law is that Gresham didn\u2019t figure out what the market really needs. Trying to explain with positivism, he took something only happening in a limited range of time and places as a core rule and misread the relationship between man and money.\nThe fact is, people use bad money not because bad money drives out good money, but because people need good money. Gresham\u2019s Law only describes the preliminary stage of currency competition, yet fails to mention the result of the overflow of bad money and the end of the competition.\nOne can tell from history that the overflow of bad money could be disastrous. No one likes bad money and it cannot survive forever. When the bad money runs out of market credit, tremendous monetary disaster takes place. When people need good money, the market would be full of good money. Good money drives out bad money. This is the law for the whole process of currency competition.", "year": 2013, "month": 12, "day": 3}
{"title": "Bitcoin Charities: Forward Thinking for Future Charities", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-charities-forward-thinking-for-future-charities-1386190967/", "birthday": "Dec 4, 2013  4:02 PM EST", "date": "2013-12-04 21:02:00", "content": "Bitcoin is changing the way we think about money and transactions, and during its brief existence has changed the way not only businesses operate, but has also been instrumental in setting new standards for charities. The cryptocurrency gets a bad rap as being a tool of drug dealers or other unsavory criminal elements, but it has changed thousands of lives through its application in unconventional charities (recently dubbed \u201cBitcoin charities.\u201d) These charities shatter preconceptions of what a deflationary currency can be used for and how aid gets directly to those in need. Bitcoin charities run more efficiently, help the individuals assisted be more self-sufficient, and avoids the high fees and inconvenience of payment systems such as PayPal.\nSean\u2019s Outpost, Bitcoin Not Bombs, and   Fr33 Aid   have used Bitcoin to feed, clothe, and medically aid those in need on the local and global levels. Accepting Bitcoin makes for swift confirmation times that allow charities to get the funds they need immediately so they can get to work efficiently. These Bitcoin charities are also thorough about documentation, something mainstream charities will need to adopt if they want to survive in the emerging crypto-economy.\nIt\u2019s easy to straw man cryptocurrencies as currency for criminals, but there\u2019s a growing narrative that it is not only being used to help people, but vastly outpaces older forms of aid. When the City of Pensacola discussed outlawing   homelessness   in an attempt to hide growing poverty, a man named Jason King reacted by setting up Sean\u2019s Outpost, a Bitcoin funded homeless outreach charity. The ordinance eventually passed. When Bitcoin reached $50 in February of 2013 and speculation over its value increased, King cut to the heart of the matter.\n\n\u201cHey, obviously this is a very interesting time to be in Bitcoin right now, but if you guys want to argue over whether this is reality or not, one Bitcoin will feed over 40 homeless people in Pensacola right now,\u201d King said. \u201cIf you guys want proof Bitcoin is real, send them to me, I\u2019ll cash them out and feed homeless people.\u201d\n\nAnd then he did exactly that; the operation has since expanded and has provided over 20,000 meals for the homeless in the region. Sean\u2019s Outpost has built a reputation for being one of the most well documented Bitcoin charities, posting pictures of the meals and projects fueled by Bitcoin.\nAdditionally, through Bitcoin donations only, King bought nine acres of property named Satoshi Forest that will be converted into a permaculture, alternative energy based homeless sanctuary. While officials try to hide the problems the city is facing, King and the activists at Sean\u2019s Outpost have shown that issues of poverty can be solved through direct action and the generosity of Bitcoin users.\nBitcoin Not Bombs, another Bitcoin nonprofit which helps start-ups accept Bitcoin, has used Bitcoin donations to clothe hundreds of people in California. Through their   Hoodie the Homeless   campaign, people could donate Bitcoin for hoodies that would be given to those facing harsh winter conditions. There was a tremendous outpouring of support and Bitcoin Not Bombs made sure to get footage of where the Bitcoin donations went so you were absolutely sure that your Bitcoin clothed people in need and didn\u2019t line the pockets of CEOs. Davi Barker, the Campaign Navigator of Bitcoin Not Bombs made an excellent point in his article about the project.\n\n\u201cOne man in particular sticks out in my mind,\u201d Barker wrote. \u201cHis name was Doug, and although he\u2019d never heard of it, the design of the hoodie interested him. After a brief explanation of what the digital currency was, his eyes lit up as he realized the potential. Of particular interest to him was the ability to manage an account from a smart phone, giving financial freedom to those who cannot open legacy bank accounts. Some of the advantages of Bitcoin for homeless people are obvious. A major problem homeless people face is robbery. Having no home means having no security, which means it\u2019s difficult to ever accumulate enough wealth to change their conditions. Bitcoin is uniquely difficult to physically steal.\n\nBitcoin not only helps charities reach individuals more easily, but also empowers them with control over their wealth. Homeless populations face unique circumstances and greatly benefit from using a currency that provides additional security and flexibility.\nThe effectiveness of Bitcoin charities in addressing the needs of individuals is not limited to local cities or regions, though. Fr33 Aid, an educational organization that does outreach about medical aid and is run by volunteers skilled in the medical profession, used Bitcoin donations to get aid to those affected by the recent typhoon in the Philippines. They fed and cared for thousands of Filipinos, and photographed their work so that donors could see their donations in action. The campaign is still active and can be donated to, and more people globally are seeing the need for wider acceptance and implementation of Bitcoin.\nBitcoin also solves the problems faced by smaller charities when it comes to processing fees.  Teresa Warmke  of Fr33 Aid ran into hurdles using PayPal to get funds to the Philippines. While Bitcoin is still on the verge of breaking into the mainstream, it is far ahead of other money transfer services. Warmke noted her problems with PayPal.\n\n\u201cThe next day though I was sending over $3K with the first full day of donations received, plus my matching contribution. This time it resulted in them flagging me as potentially fraudulent, and then they only allowed me to do an e-check, which takes about a week longer than usual, or credit card, which carries hefty fees\u2026The next day, though, they defaulted to credit card for the next payment rather than transfer or e-check, which resulted them gouging me for a fee to send the donation. Have I mentioned lately how much I HATE PayPal? Way to gouge people trying to send money to one of their oldest friends to help folks in the Philippines!\u201d\n\nPayPal ended up refusing to refund the exorbitant fees despite them overriding defaults on their account set by Fr33 Aid. Bitcoin allows users to select miner fees which speed up transaction confirmations, but these are optional. This built-in feature means you can expedite funds for a very small fee or choose no fee if that suits your needs. Also, there is no entity that can withhold Bitcoin from the needy if they decide that an account needs to be seized or payments delayed. The speedy response meant that Fr33 Aid was able to tackle remote parts of the Philippines that larger aid organizations could not reach. This efficiency adds to Fr33 Aid and others being on the cutting edge of charities.\nDocumentation of donations is imperative, especially when it comes to sending funds internationally. Not all charities do this, however, and in times of national disasters, even the most seemingly reputable charities have documentation issues or   misallocation   problems. The seamless ability of Bitcoin to transcend borders means organizations get to work immediately without having to wait on slower payment processing companies. The way in which some charities collect donations is outdated; Salvation Army still doesn\u2019t accept credit cards despite innovations like Square that make it easy for people who don\u2019t carry cash. Like cash, older charities are becoming ancient because of their antiquated methods of collecting funds.\nThrough meticulous documentation and direct action eased by the nature of Bitcoin, Bitcoin charities like Sean\u2019s Outpost, Bitcoin Not Bombs, and Fr33 Aid are laying a solid foundation for future charities. Innovation by Bitcoin charities is building momentum that will only increase and if older charities don\u2019t jump on the Bitcoin bandwagon and become more transparent with their donations, they will be left behind.\n", "year": 2013, "month": 12, "day": 4}

One of the optimal ways for Bitcoiners and those interested in learning more to meet together is through conferences. This past year, the number of Bitcoin related conferences increased exponentially. Having taken part in several, some of the highlights are excellent speakers, a time to be reunited with old friends, and most importantly opportunities to network, share ideas and even, in some cases, meet potential business partners. The North American Bitcoin Conference, set to take place in Miami, Florida from January 25-26 2014 will be one of the premier conferences of this year.\nAfter the success of the European Bitcoin Convention in Amsterdam of September of this year, Moe Levin immediately began planning the next big conference of the year and chose the Bitcoin hot-spot location of Miami. Currently, theMiami International Bitcoin community is one of the largest Bitcoin communities in the US with regular meet-ups, speaking circuits and an active forum community. I personally can not think of a better spot for the next big Bitcoin Conference.\nMoe Levin sent out the following press release this week:\nBITCOIN SET TO HEAT UP MIAMI\nMore than 500 bitcoin community members will soon be diverging on Miami for a direction-setting conference aimed at driving the currency from speculation to mainstream. Building on the recent success of the European Bitcoin Convention, the North American Bitcoin Conference will hit Miami Beach on the 25th and 26th of January, 2014.\nRich in potential and steeped in controversy, bitcoin is a radically new kind of money that operates without governments or banks. Already available and in limited use, bitcoin has recently become a hot topic thanks to intense value-fluctuations, political pressure and surging media attention.\nIn response to these changes in the bitcoin landscape, the North American Bitcoin Conference (NABC) intends to bring focus to the divergent bitcoin community that now includes enthusiasts, speculators, business-users and politicians. To ensure hard-hitting outcomes, speakers will include Roger Ver, Charlie Schrem, Tony Gallippi and Charlie Lee amongst others.\nAs part of its mission to grow bitcoin use, the NABC will also offer workshops targeted at merchants, and act as a forum for vendors, exhibitors, and recent bitcoin startups to share their latest innovations and inform discussions. In addition, regulators, banks and government officials will be on hand to lead panel discussions that are light on fluff and heavy on content.\nFor tickets and the most up-to-date news visit: btcmiami.com\n\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\nContact details from here down.\nMoe Levin\nOrganizer\nhttp://www.btcmiami.com\n[email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=\"currentScript\"in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\"),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\"cf-hash\"))return t[e]}();if(t&&t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(\"data-cfemail\");if(a){for(e=\"\",r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]> */", "year": 2013, "month": 11, "day": 17}

But in the Netherlands restaurant \u2018De Waag\u2019 in Delft is the place where it all began. They are still seen as the number one in NL which made it possible to pay your coffee, beers and \u00e0 la carte meals with Bitcoins. We took an interview with Hugo Overvoorde, manager of De Waag, to ask him about the beginning of times, the development of Bitcoin in De Waag and about the present situation.\nChristien Havranek: When did you start with accepting Bitcoins in De Waag and what has been the reason of that?\nHugo Overvoorde: In the second half of April 2013 we started with accepting Bitcoins as valid currency. The main reason for that was the suggestion of Ronald Prins (one of the founders of Fox-IT, a Dutch security company who prevents, solves and mitigates cyber threats for government, defense, banking etc worldwidehttps://www.fox-it.com/en/) who approached me [and said] that it would be great to be the first in the Netherlands where it is possible to pay with Bitcoins. He was already into the Bitcoin for a couple of years and knows a lot about them. And while Delft is maybe the most innovative city of the Netherlands because of the TU Delft, Delft University of Technology (http://www.tudelft.nl/en/) it seemed to be a good idea. I did not know anything about Bitcoins, but I saw it as a change I should take. So I started reading and reading and after two days I knew enough about them to confirm. Together with Ronald Prins we started this up and that made De Waag being the first physical place in the Netherlands where it is possible to pay with Bitcoins.\nCH: So that was the first step and the beginning. And then what happened after this decision?\nHO: About two weeks later the whole Dutch media approached me for interviews. Newspapers, radio channels and also television programs called me, it was very busy on that way. It seemed to be that Bitcoin has officially born in the Netherlands. They even made a short sketch about how to pay with Bitcoins in de Waag. Also to show others how it works. It seems a bit to be a success story because this craziness is still going on now.\n\nCH: What are the consequences for De Waag itself because of Bitcoin? Do you see changes in sale or audience?\nHO: I don\u2019t see a lot of difference in the sales yet. I don\u2019t care about this because I rather regard it as an extra service we deliver to our customers. What I see, is the changing and the growth of the guests who pay with Bitcoins. In the beginning it were especially the \u2018ICT guys\u2019 who came in with the story that they bought some Bitcoins in 2009 for a few dollars and asked me if it is true, that they can pay their beers now with them. They were positively surprised. The population who have Bitcoins now is expanding. What I see around me is that not everybody who has them pays with them a lot. While it\u2019s a bit of a rebellious monetary unit it seems to be cool having them, so they keep them. The raising offer of places where you can pay with them creates more news and this increases the interest of people for Bitcoins.\nDon\u2019t think that we have hundreds of transactions with Bitcoins now. Normally it is between five and ten a week. We like to see the same people come back. For example a group of around five people who pays with Bitcoins is visiting de Waag for dinner every week now. Generally it\u2019s going about transactions between 30 and 40 euro\u2019s. The last week we just had one or two Bitcoin transactions. This is because of the enormous raise of the value last time. The Bitcoin increased from 97 to over 300 euros in about two weeks. Who could imagine this would happen so fast? Everybody seems to really take care with spending them now and keep them into the pocket because it can be that they raise a lot more.\nCH: Do you see it as a risk, using the Bitcoin as currency at De Waag?\nHO: Of course you don\u2019t know what is going to happen with the Bitcoin. From the first day on some people laughed about us accepting Bitcoins because they think that it\u2019s just temporarily and it will fall down very soon. But it\u2019s still here, and when this ever would happen, it was a very good step to be the first restaurant in the Netherlands. This also because of all the publicity. Next to the radio and television in the Netherlands also abroad the press approach us for interviews. When you translate this free publicity into money it\u2019s a big win anyhow. And next to this, a great adventure we really wouldn\u2019t have missed.\nCH: What do you do with the Bitcoins De Waag receives?\nHO: What we do with a Bitcoin transfer is generate the euros into Bitcoin with an iPad, and then people can pay by using the QR-code. Than we put it on a kind of Bitcoin Bank, www.bitmymoney.com. Ronald de Reinder, owner of this bank, sends us an email every week with the question how much of the received Bitcoins we do want to receive as cash. Every week we cash some. But we also leave Bitcoins on it, especially at times like this when the rate is rising so enormously.\nCH: What do you expect for the future of De Waag and the Bitcoin?\nHO: The only danger I can imagine now is that wallets might be hacked. I don\u2019t expect the Bitcoin to fall down and so we will go on with this for sure. We like it to be a quick and transparent way of paying. It\u2019s interesting that some important parties are approaching us now like the Dutch tax authorities, they don\u2019t know what to do with Bitcoins and taxes. Last week I also had a conference call with the Dutch Bank. They need to do something with the Bitcoin, so they are also looking for a way to maintain this currency. This also means that the acknowledgement about Bitcoin is still raising and proves our statement to accept Bitcoins in De Waag till the end of time.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nChristien Havranek has a background in Social Psychology and (Marketing) Communication.

Their new business, Coin Validation, seeks to create a more regulator-friendly Bitcoin ecosystem by maintaining a Bitcoin \u201cgreenlist\u201d \u2013 a database of Bitcoin addresses tied to established identities, which any user or business can join by signing up with Coin Validation, going through their identity verification procedures, and integrating their API. A more precise name for what the company is doing would actually be \u201caddress validation\u201d; the intent is to allow businesses to deliberately use \u201cgreen\u201d addresses to make trackable payments that are tied to their physical identities. Some businesses may then choose to only accept payments from green addresses, thereby proving to regulators that they are not accepting Bitcoin funds from unknown and potentially problematic sources. This scheme, the project\u2019s founders hope, will be adopted by Bitcoin businesses and embraced by US government regulators as a quick path to helping Bitcoin businesses in the United States remain compliant with the law.\nHowever, the scheme has been met with almost universal disapproval from the Bitcoin community. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to count the number of times newbies have made proposals which would have centralized Bitcoin completely in the name of some fool result or another,\u201d Bitcoin developer Gregory Maxwell wrote. \u201cPowerful businesses interests are now reliving the same history of bad ideas, but this time the bad ideas will be funded and they don\u2019t care if luminaries tell them that they\u2019re horrible ideas, they don\u2019t necessarily care about any of the principles that make Bitcoin a worthwhile contribution to the world.\u201d Bitcoin advocates across the internet have denounced the measure as ruinous to Bitcoin\u2019s privacy, and some are advocating an outright boycott of all US businesses.\nNetwork Effects\nBut what are the effects of this greenlist potentially going to be, and how could it help or harm the Bitcoin ecosystem? The first question to ask is, does it \u201caffect\u201d the Bitcoin ecosystem at all? That is to say, will this potentially have a negative effect on even those Bitcoin network as a whole, or is it simply an optional layer which those interested can use, similar to colored coins or Mastercoin?\nAs Waters would have us believe, it\u2019s the latter. \u201cThe existing Bitcoin community will find this very controversial from a privacy perspective,\u201d Waters admits, \u201cBut it\u2019s simple, straightforward and opt in.\u201d As far as being simple and straightforward, he is entirely correct, at least at first glance. Although anti-money-laundering identity verification procedures are always difficult to go through, a green address mechanism is not particularly technically difficult to integrate. On the \u201copt in\u201d point, however, the situation is much more tricky. The \u201cit\u2019s voluntary\u201d argument may strike a chord with many in the Bitcoin community, who often hold the philosophy that voluntary interactions are ethically good and should not be restricted. Ordinarily, this philosophy has a solid economic underpinning: a person will only consent to a transaction if that transaction leaves them, in their own view, better off, so a voluntary transaction should benefit all parties who participate. However, in this particular case the economic underpinnings behind voluntarist philosophy fall apart precisely because there is an involuntary actor involved: the US government. Thus, what we have is a bargaining problem, the game-theoretic analysis of which is much less simple.\nTo understand why bargaining situations are so problematic, consider a fairly simple example. Suppose that armed robbers go into a gold storage facility, and demand at gunpoint that the owners open the safe and hand over all the gold. Fearing for their lives, the owners do, and the robbers get away with some quantity of gold. However, now suppose that the safe had been designed so that it is impossible to open it without waiting twenty minutes. Then, the robbers would know that the owners would not be able to open the safe quickly, and therefore would be less likely to try to mount an attack in the first place. The counterintuitive conclusion is this: under some circumstances, strictly reducing an agent\u2019s freedom in a bargaining problem can actually be very beneficial to them.\nThe situation is the same here. In terms of privacy, Bitcoin has the potential to be both much, much better and much, much worse than the status quo of the financial system today. On the \u201cbetter\u201d side, we can have an ecosystem of overlay services such as Zerocoin, trustless mixing and conventional mixing to effectively eliminate the traceability of Bitcoin payments on the small scale \u2013 although large-scale financial movements on the order of millions or billions of dollars would still be very difficult to hide. On the \u201cworse\u201d side, however, Bitcoin as it stands allows every transaction to be tracked, and governments may mandate that Bitcoin users only make transactions with Bitcoin addresses verified to their identities. Accepting non-whitelisted bitcoins or mixing non-whitelisted bitcoins along with whitelisted ones may even become a criminal offense. This \u201cgreenlist\u201d will make it much easier for businesses to adopt the second model \u2013 and therefore, just like removing the twenty-minute timer on the safe, make it much more attractive for governments to mandate that they do just that. In fact, Waters even recognizes this fact himself, saying that eventually \u201cevery user who wants to do business in the U.S.\u201d will have at least one registered Bitcoin address.\nFurthermore, the consequences of this will extend far beyond the United States. The privacy properties of Bitcoin are such that the more addresses can be reliably linked to their users\u2019 identities the easier it becomes to uncover other identities as well. Without any knowledge of identities, mapping Bitcoin addresses to users is a highly difficult, and imprecise, graph isomorphism problem, and so far researchers have been unable to identify anyone other than very large entities like BitPay and MtGox. Once even a few address-owner pairs are known, however, they can be used as \u201canchors\u201d to discover other address owners as well \u2013 employers, business customers, friends, anyone with whom you have a relationship with that is visible on both the real world level and the Bitcoin level is potentially fair game.\nThe Bitcoin economy is highly globalized, as the ability to quickly and cheaply send money internationally is one of Bitcoin\u2019s greatest advantages. The globalized nature of the Bitcoin economy is very beneficial to Bitcoin, even in terms of its resilience against regulation \u2013 if some governments crack down, Bitcoin businesses can simply move to more welcoming jurisdictions. But this advantage can also be turned on its head. With an entity inside the United States, and heavily cooperating with regulators in the United States, knowing the owners of even ten percent of Bitcoin addresses, as Waters hopes, the United States government will have sole, proprietary access to a large amount of financial data about the entire world \u2013 that is to say, a privacy disaster on a scale as vast, if not vaster, than the National Security Agency. Thus, even if Coinvalidation was set up with the noble intention of helping to \u201cproliferate Bitcoin, and to help Bitcoin companies succeed specifically in the United States of America,\u201d what it has done in effect is set itself up as yet another arm for the US government to extend its surveillance and control over the entire world.\nEconomics and Fungibility\nAnother major criticism of this system, one that has been most prominently made by \u201cgrandfather of Bitcoin\u201d Adam Back, is that it breaks fungibility. Fungibility is an important aspect of Bitcoin as a monetary system; what it means is that every bitcoin is worth the same as every other bitcoin regardless of whether the bitcoin is freshly mined, received two weeks ago from an exchange, earned in the process of employment, received from a known drug seller on Silk Road or seized by the FBI from Silk Road. Any kind of \u201cgreenlisting\u201d (or, for that matter, blacklisting) scheme breaks fungibility. What will happen is this. First of all, bitcoins that are inside the green address system will inevitably become worth more than bitcoins outside the system; say, there might be a \u201cgreen premium\u201d of 1%. Businesses will thus accept green bitcoins at a 1% discount, so it will become 1% more lucrative for ordinary users to buy bitcoins from regulated exchanges than from private employers or localbitcoins. The profit potential for those businesses that have the power to convert non-green bitcoins into green bitcoins by passing them through their system is obvious, and potentially massive \u2013 and, necessarily, at the wider Bitcoin community\u2019s expense.\nFrom the merchant\u2019s point of view, Bitcoin would incur a de-facto transaction fee. Any merchant that does not opt in to the list will have no way of knowing if they are receiving \u201cgreen\u201d bitcoins or \u201cstandard\u201d bitcoins; thus, customers would likely end up sending all of their standard bitcoins to merchants, leaving merchants to sell those bitcoins to exchanges without the green premium \u2013 paying what is essentially a 1% fee along the way. The greenlisting system may not work exactly as was implied here, but in any case one can figure out how similar consequences will arise. The long-term economic effects of such a system are completely unknown, but in any case Bitcoin\u2019s status as a friction-free, nearly cost-free transaction medium will be fatally compromised.\nThe final question is, will this actually help reduce Bitcoin-related crime? Bitcoin crime is an issue; although many Bitcoin users proudly support sites like the illegal drug market Silk Road, nearly everyone agrees that \u201cransomware\u201d bots like Cryptolocker, which infect computers and encrypt their hard drives releasing the unencrypted data only in exchange for a ransom, are undesirable, and ideally there would be some way to prevent such services from existing. But would a green list actually help? Probably not. Criminals likely already avoid the regulated exchange ecosystem entirely, instead either buying and selling through localbitcoins or in-person exchang events or simply using their illicit earnings to buy products. One can even launder the funds cross-chain \u2013 send one\u2019s illicit earnings to an altcoin exchange to buy litecoins, mix the litecoins, and then sell the litecoins in exchange for green bitcoins. In order to avoid this, every cryptocurrency in existence would need to have a greenlist mechanism. In any case, the conclusion is the same: even if the greenlist program was effective, it would do nothing against genuine crime, and would instead primarily affect legitimate users that still want to participate in society.\nSo what can the privacy-conscious Bitcoin community do? First of all, not participating in the greenlist will be a start. But the idea of a greenlist will come back, and grow, if there is an incentive for companies to adopt it. Simply doing nothing and hoping the problem goes away is not a viable solution. Another alternative is to support the adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies. Zerocoin is building a more fully anonymous version of Bitcoin, and trustless mixing provides a good-enough form of Bitcoin anonymization that we can use today. The Dark Wallet, initially derided by many as unnecessarily extremist and dramatic in its announcement, is now appearing much more attractive now that we are seeing what the alternative might be; to guard against Bitcoin de-anonymization, the wallet will include built-in automatic trustless mixing as one of its core features. The project is actively seeking crowdfunding on Indiegogo to fund its development. Finally, of course, there is the political solution: interact with the United States as little as possible. Fortunately, if Bitcoin businesses do choose to take that path, China appears to be quite willing to take them.\nDisclaimer: Mihai Alisie and myself have some involvement in the Dark Wallet project", "year": 2013, "month": 11, "day": 15}
{"title": "Bitcoin in Israel, Part 4: Community and Startups", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-in-israel-part-4-community-and-startups-1384327722/", "birthday": "Nov 13, 2013  2:28 AM EST", "date": "2013-11-13 07:28:00", "content": "The Bitcoin community in Israel has made considerable waves over the past year. A meetup group that, one year ago, had less than twenty people attending every month, now has over sixty people attending every two weeks, with a record of over three hundred in April. The Israeli Bitcoin Facebook group recently grew to over 800 members, an impressive amount for a country of only eight million. Tel Aviv, a city of 410,000, has no less than three Bitcoin-accepting restaurants \u2013 a higher density than even that of Berlin. Finally, perhaps most importantly of all, Israel is know worldwide for being a very entrepreneurial country, with a large number of startups coming out every year, and the Bitcoin fever has not escaped the startup community either; Israel has what are perhaps among the most interesting Bitcoin startups in the entire world.\nIn the previous parts of this series, we had an in-depth interview with Meni Rosenfeld and Ron Gross, the founder and chief co-founder of the Israeli Bitcoin community, where we discussed the developments that had been going on in the past two years and their view for the future of the Bitcoin community in Israel. Here, I look at what is happening in Israel, today, including the key cultural and business landmarks of this amazing Bitcoin community.\nRestaurants\n\nThe oldest of the three Bitcoin-accepting restaurants is called the Bar Kayma. The Bar Kayma is a vegetarian/vegan restaurant that opened in 2012, and was recruited into the Bitcoin fold very soon after. The restaurant is unique in that it is a cooperative; the restaurant is collectively owned by a few hundred individuals, each of whom has an equal vote in the restaurant\u2019s decision making. Anyone can join the cooperative; the only requirement is that members make a one-time investment requirement of 1000 NIS (~$283 USD), which entitles them to voting rights as well as a permanent 20% discount at the Bar. The Bar is also not just a bar; the upper floors of its building hold presentations, usually on social and economic concepts, every day, and the Bar also has a few rooms available for rent as a living space or hotel, with a price of about $30 USD per day.\n\nThe next is called October Bar, and is where the local meetup group now holds most informal gatherings. At the end of October, the meetup group held a special event to celebrate the fifth anniversary of Satoshi\u2019s now famous Bitcoin white paper \u2013 a date which has now semi-officially been christened as Satoshi\u2019s birthday:\n\nFinally, there is Galabi-Anat\u2019s place, a less prominent Bitcoin restaurant, but one which has nevertheless started accepting the currency more recently.\n\nMath and Startups\nThe Israeli Bitcoin community particularly distinguishes itself in two key ways: cryptography and entrepreneurship. On the cryptography side, Israel is home to Adi Shamir, well-known for his pioneering work in RSA encryption, secret sharing and differential cryptanalysis; more recently he made a semi-famous analysis of the Bitcoin transaction graph. Somewhat less famous, but potentially much more important to Bitcoin\u2019s future, is Eli ben Sasson, leader of a team at the Technion developing an implementation of \u201csecure computational integrity and privacy\u201c, a new cryptographic technology that may eventually be used to make cryptocurrencies thousands of times more space-efficient. Finally, the most well-known of all in the Bitcoin community is Meni Rosenfeld, a mathematician responsible for an analysis of mining pool reward methods and an analysis of double-spending attacks \u2013 as well as founding the Israeli Bitcoin community in the first place. As far as entrepreneurship goes, the Israeli Bitcoin community is largely responsible for nearly all work around the concept of \u201ccolored coins\u201c, and is responsible for perhaps the largest per-capita number of Bitcoin startups in the entire world.\nColored coins \u2013 the idea behind colored coins was first conceived with the help of Meni Rosenfeld, the main Israeli Bitcoin community organizer, and has been largely funded by eToro, a \u201csocial investment\u201d platform based in Tel Aviv which is looking at using the technology in 2014; today, many people are predicting that colored coins will be the next big development in Bitcoin technology, even going so far as to call 2014 the \u201cyear of the colored coin\u201c.Mastercoin \u2013 Mastercoin is an advanced crypto-finance protocol that lives on the Bitcoin blockchain and offers advanced features such as on-blockchain price feeds, scripting and self-stabilizing currencies. The protocol was invented by J.R. Willett, who lives in the United States, but there is a high level of Mastercoin interest in Israel; Ron Gross, the co-founder of the Israeli Bitcoin community, has recently stepped up as the Executive Director of the Mastercoin Foundation.Buy The Way \u2013 Buy the Way is a social commerce startup, which is using Bitcoin to target two specific use cases. First of all, it is developing a mobile application to make it easy to split a restaurant bill after the fact, with one person paying the bill at the time and everyone else later compensating them in BTC. The second use case is on-the-fly proxy buying; if you see a product that you think a friend might like, you can take a picture and send it to them to see if they want it. If they do, you can buy it for them and they will compensate you in BTC. Buy the Way is particularly promising because it provides a convenient way to spread bitcoins around to your friends, potentially getting Bitcoin into the hands of many thousands of people for the first time.Dov-E \u2013 in long form, \u201cData over Voice\u201d, Dov-E is a startup that is creating a technology that allows phones to communicate with each other over voice. This can potentially provide a more secure and easy-to-use alternative to QR codes, allowing a customer and merchant to simply put their two phones against each other to quickly process a Bitcoin payment.Proxycoins \u2013 essentially, a peer-to-peer Bitspend. Bitspend, when it was around, offered a \u201cproxy buying\u201d service with which someone with BTC can order a product which is normally only purchaseable via a credit card, and have Bitspend\u2019 customer service personnel rapidly process the order for them and pay with their own credit cards in exchange for BTC. However, Bitspend shut down after losing its bank account. Proxycoins gets around the centralized point of failure problem by essentially allowing anyone to be the \u201cproxy\u201d.Coinpair \u2013 an instant altcoin exchange. Anyone can go to coinpair.com, enter their address in any cryptocurrency, and then receive another address to which they can deposit money in any other cryptocurrency. Upon receiving any payment, Coinpair then sends an equivalent amount of coins to the address that the user entered in the user\u2019s desired currency.\nIf you do plan on visiting Israel, be sure to check out BTCTrip for Bitcoin-friendly plane tickets.", "year": 2013, "month": 11, "day": 13}

The Argentinian Bitcoin community is rapidly growing in reaction to national economic strain, but most importantly due to the opportunities Bitcoin represents as a disruptive technology and economic growth potential. With an inflating Argentinian Peso and limited access to additional fiat currencies such as the US Dollar, Bitcoin provides a credible solution and represents opportunity for Argentinians and those interested in doing business in Argentina.\nArgentina\u2019s citizenship has turned to Bitcoin just as citizens of Cyprus have to guard savings accounts and financial futures against inflation and excess government intervention. Argentinians are now keeping their savings in alternative currencies such as Bitcoin and assets. To date, Bitcoin has also had a high technological adoption rate in terms of broadband and mobile telephone and Internet within Argentina.\nAside from laBITconf 2013 the Fundaci\u00f3n Bitcoin Argentina hosts over a dozen bitcoin related projects and activities with a varying degree of development such as the Meetups and \u00b5Meetups Organization, University Seminars, Press Management, Local Referrals Database, incuBITcoin, theBITclub, Bitcoin Training, Statistical Analysis of Bitcoin Adoption, Legal and Taxing Regulation Research, the Bitcoin Fair, Startup Seeding and Jobs Offerings Channeling. As a local foundation that started to take shape back on March 2013, Fundaci\u00f3n Bitcoin Argentina (FBA) formed when the three founding members decided to give a proper framework to their ongoing efforts to promote and inform about bitcoin. Now the FBA has over 97 volunteer collaborators and has hosted over 14 meetups, some of them with over 150 attendees.\nThe laBITconf team released the following announcement:\nlaBITconf (Latin American Bitcoin Conference) is perhaps the last BIG conference of the year and will be the first one simultaneously translated for Hispanic audiences. Wisely hosted in Argentina, it attracted over 25 top notch speakers such as Jeff Garzik, Andreas Antonopoulos, Erik Voorhees, Tony Gallippi, Roger Veer, Marco Santori, Charlie Shrem and Tuur Demeester among others.\nWhy is Bitcoin blooming in Argentina?\nBitcoin is gaining strong local adoption and constant main media coverage given that we live at \u201cthe perfect storm\u201d for Bitcoin to succeed: We have over 30% of yearly inflation (in the our 130 years of local currency we lost over 10 zeros); we suffer a hard restriction for buying foreign currencies, also for international money transfer, we even suffered a major \u201ccorralito\u201d back in 2001 which blocked their holdings and diminished its value (similar to what Crete has recently suffered). So most people tend to prefer keep their savings in other currencies.\nWhat can we expect from this conference?\nWe have two major objectives; the first one, as one of the last conferences of the year it will summarize the best practices, and up to date information in all major Bitcoin projects with most speakers adding a special approach to Latin America and the second one, to provide an excellent opportunity for locals and international attendees to network (we already have over 70 international attendees registered seeking for local opportunities). We might also have some new business/projects announcements.\nThis conference is divided into two days, the first one more general and the second one full of local and international case studies. We will have 6 lunch talks for specific topics including Trading, Altcoin, Mining or Security and a local study related to Satoshi\u2019s Steps.\nWhat is the Fundaci\u00f3n Bitcoin Argentina?\nIt\u2019s a local foundation founded on March 2013 by three members but today it has over 97 collaborators and hosted over 14 meetups with up to 150 attendees. Actually we have over 12 different projects such as laBITconf, Meetups, \u00b5Meetups, University Seminars, Press Management, Local Referrals Database, incuBITcoin, theBITclub, Teaching, Statistical Analysis, Legal Analysis, Bitcoin Fair, Seeding, Jobs Offers, and others.\nBitcoin Magazine is privileged to serve as a Media Sponsor for the Conference and looks forward to seeing you there!", "year": 2013, "month": 11, "day": 14}

Senators are seeking further information on how Bitcoin is used to date and additionally whether or not this digital currency poses a threat or greater benefit to US citizens and those abroad. This first hearing to date on virtual currencies certainly has not taken away from exponential price growth of the currency.\nTomorrow, the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Subcommittee on National Security and International Trade and Finance and Subcommittee on Economic Policy will hold a hearing entitled, \u201cThe Present and Future Impact of Virtual Currencies.\u201d The witnesses on the first panel include Jennifer Shasky Calvery (Director, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network), David Cotney (Commissioner of Banks, Massachusetts Division of Banks).

Discussion will most likely highlight the positive impact Bitcoin on Small Businesses, US economic growth, e-commerce, and most importantly individual US citizens.\nWhat is to come following these hearings? We do not know, but we can only hope that the US government will note the tremendous growth of the Bitcoin economy within the past few month alone and recognize the sure benefits Bitcoin provides not only to the US economy but to individuals around the world.

The IDESG was basicallyspun out of NISTor the National Institute of Science and Technology to \u201cadminister the development of policy, standards, and accreditation processes for the Identity Ecosystem Framework.\u201d\nIn April 2011,President Obama signed(PDF) the NSTIC or the National Strategy For Trusted Identities In Cyberspace where public and private players are collaborating on the creation of an \u201cIdentity Ecosystem\u201dto address\u201c(1) the insecurity and inconvenience of static passwords and (2) the cost of transactional risks that arise from the inability of individuals to prove their true identity online.\u201d\n\nImage via \u201cInterim Identity Ecosystem: \u201cAre we there yet?\u201d\u201d\nShortly thereafter, Chicago basedPayment Pathways Inc. submitted a recommendation\u201cGovernance recommendation for Greenlist and the importance of its relationship to NSTIC\u201d to National Strategy for Trusted Identity in Cyberspace andstatedthat a wide variety of stakeholders collaborated on Payment Pathways\u2019 Greenlist to play a role in the NSTIC.\nPayment Pathways (PPI) describes itself as a company that \u201cmakes it safe to transfer ownership of assets electronically. Through its patented Greenlist registry, PPI defines liability responsibilities and ensures that operational, legal, and security obligations are met in alignment with the Fair Information Practice Principles as articulated in the NSTIC to reduce friction and risk.\u201d\nThe United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) recently published Richard O\u2019Brien and Andrew Gallant\u2019s patent application20130282580, \u201cSystems And Methods for Extending Identity Attributes and Authentication Factors In An ePayment Address Registry.\u201d Although the patent doesn\u2019t appear to be assigned to Payment Pathways,Mr. O\u2019Brienis the President and CEO of the company and Mr. Gallant has been listed in numerous patents by Payment Pathways and is also amember of the Identity Ecosystem Steering Group. The patent application discusses Payment Pathways\u2019 Greenlist which is also a Registered Trademark issued to Payment Pathways by the USPTO which according a Wordmark Search dates back to September 2005 and was first used in commerce in June 2007 as an \u201con-line directory of secure consumer financial identity information for authentication and authorization for transaction processing, namely, payment processing.\u201d While the Greenlist predates Bitcoin, this patent filing incorporates Bitcoin into its features.\nFollowing is the Abstract of the patent application:\n\u201cThe present invention relates to a network of registries that are: synchronized in whole or in part to a root registry; and are compilations of registrant data from accredited Identity Providers that accept liability for registering verified and accurate identity attributes. Registries associate a unique identifier with: a financial account owner\u2019s Personally Identifying Information; one or more linked publicly discoverable ePayment addresses to an account at a Financial Institution; and a financial account owner\u2019s profile of preferences related to the capture, handling, transfer and storage of monetary and informational assets. Preferences extensions include: operating instructions and rule sets; and authentication factors that may make use of time sensitive data at one or more institutions.\u201d\nMore specifically:\n\u201cThis invention relates to a computer system and method to a.) establish and validate an individual\u2019s new and existing unique identity attributes related to the individual\u2019s primary identity; b.) validate physical devices when used to effect the transfer, storage and retrieval of informational and/or monetary assets; c.) maintain safeguards to ensure that custodians of informational and monetary assets execute instructions of owners; and d.) facilitate the use of additional authentication factors when effecting the transfer, storage and retrieval of informational and/or monetary assets.\u201d\nIt further defines the Greenlist:\n\u201cGreenlist.RTM. verified ePayments are safe and secure without consumers having to disclose any actual account or bankcard information whatsoever. In order to attain scale and ubiquity, this registry resource is operated by a network of synchronized Authoritative Parties that verify identities and payment addresses before transactions are made. Data in the Greenlist.RTM. network of registries are supplied by only Financial Institutions (FIs) functioning as registrars that accept the liability for accuracy. Registrars perform identity proofing of every registrant\u2019s Personal Identifying Information (PII) prior to registering new linked identity attributes to the Greenlist.RTM. registry. A Relying Party obtains access to trusted registrant data from an Authoritative Party and may provide access for applications or individuals via its public or private portal.\u201d\nAn example whereby a Bitcoin is used in the Grenlist was provided as follows:\n\u201c..a customer\u2019s registration records may include identity attributes related to other information or transaction addresses. In one example, a registrant may wish to include a Bitcoin address, so that this address may be retrieved during a transaction when both parties agree to use Bitcoins as the currency. In this case, the payee (the customer) provides at least the identifier registered in the ePayments address registry. The payor, who may be either trusted or may be acting through a trusted entity, receives the payee\u2019s Bitcoin payment address after the registry is queried, and may then proceed with the transfer. In other examples, other payment addresses, e.g., for bank accounts, PayPal.TM. accounts, etc., may be stored as identity attributes, possibly masked, hashed, or tokenized, and then retrieved for use.\u201d\nAnd finally, Anti-Money Laundering features are discussed:\n\u201cIn cases where an anonymous Bitcoin ePayment address is registered in the Greenlist, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) concerns are alleviated because lawful interceptors now have a mechanism to subpoena records of the Identity Provider that functioned as the registrar of the Bitcoin ePayment address. In the future, the banks with customer accounts that are the final recipient account addresses of a multi-step money transfer, and where that transfer involves intermediate currency conversions, can be regulated to only receive money transfers from an intermediate Bitcoin currency account that is registered as paired with a sender\u2019s unique identifier, and additionally when that sender\u2019s identity is similarly registered as linked to the receiver. In this example, anonymity can be protected for commercial and privacy purposes but in extreme cases where threats to the state or public safety are concerns, a mechanism can exist for lifting the veil of anonymity after proper judicial review and permission is obtained.\u201d\nIt is interesting to note that the patent application was filed on March 15th, a mere three days prior toFinCEN\u2019s Guidanceon \u201cApplication of FinCEN\u2019s Regulations to Persons Administering, Exchanging, or Using Virtual Currencies.\u201d\nWhile FinCEN\u2019s \u201cguidance\u201d receivedmixed reviewsby the Bitcoin Foundation, Anti-Money Laundering proposals for the cryptocurrency such as Payment Pathways\u2019 Greenlist are being brought to the table while AML framework is being hammered out by bureaucrats. Clearly defined AML and KYC (Know Your Customer) systems are needed for larger players who have been stifled by the current regulatory and compliance climate. For instance, BitInstant has a lengthyAML statement(PDF) \u201cStatement of BitInstant on Preventing Money Laundering and Illegal Activity through its Services and in the Bitcoin Network\u201d but has apparently suspended operations since earlier this summer. While it is uncertain if Payment Pathways\u2019 technology is an AML silver (green??) bullet and patent applications do not necessarily indicate there are commercial products ready, you can be certain that this patent application will be one of many to follow.", "year": 2013, "month": 11, "day": 12}

With two panels and a captivated audience on the Hill and via online around the world, the first US Congressional Hearing on virtual currencies can be viewed as a success.\nSenator Carper (D-DE) opened up the hearing with an introduction expressing the committee\u2019s interest in learning more of the benefits and potential risks of virtual currencies. Entitled, \u201cBeyond Silk Road: Potential Risks, Threats, and Promises of Virtual Currencies,\u201d the hearing started off with the first panel of representatives from the US Government including Jennifer Shasky Calvery (Director, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network U.S. Department of the Treasury), Mythili Raman (Acting Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, U.S. Department of Justice), and Edward W. Lowery III (Special Agent in Charge, Criminal Investigative Division, U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Department of Homeland Security).\nJennifer Shasky Calvery of FinCen opened the first panel and expressed the need for smart regulations that minimize risk. Jennifer highlighted that virtual exchanges can fit into the pre-existing regulatory regime in the US. She proceeded to explain that the PATRIOT Act and Bank Secrecy Act have already provided the tools and the platform for FinCen and the US Government to crack down on illicit activity and specifically pointed out that Section 311 of the Patriot Act was used to crack down on Liberty Reserve. As FinCen\u2019s main goal is to crack down on terrorism and money laundering, Jennifer emphasized that innovation comes with obligation and encouraged each business to register with FinCen, put in place AML restrictions, maintain records and provide service reports to FinCen. She specifically emphasized that it is a privilege to be a part of a global financial system. In response to Senator Carper\u2019s question related to keeping businesses in the United States, she discussed how each country has an interest in protecting consumers and investors from fraud.\nMythili Raman Acting Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division of the US Department of Justice stressed that virtual currency services are not in and of themselves illegal. Mythill expressed that law enforcement must remain vigilant and understand the challenges of anonymity continue to keep up with innovation. Similar to Jennifer Shasky of FinCen, Mythili highlighted that current money laundering and criminal statutes are advanced enough to apply to virtual currencies and that money laundering statutes have been very effective thus far. She expressed the goal to send a message to illicit actors and keep pace with what is to come.\nEdward W. Lowery III of the Secret Service concluded the panel to explain that the Secret Service must continue to adapt to changing threats and highlighted current efforts in place to aggressively and strategically investigate based in the confines of existing laws. Edward did recognize that technically gifted investigators are needed to tackle the new developments in the virtual currency space. Edward stated that the Secret Service attacks problems strategically and supports aggressive law enforcement. Chairman Carper concluded the first panel with recognition that the committee has an oversight role and a need to make sure that the current Administration is working in a cohesive and collaborative manner. Chairman Carper\u2019s main question was, \u201cIs it possible to reap the economic benefits of Bitcoin but at the same time clean up the criminal misbehavior that is out there?\u201d\nThe second panel featured Ernie Allen (President and Chief Executive Officer, The International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children), Patrick Murck (General Counsel, The Bitcoin Foundation, Inc), Jeremy Allaire (Chief Executive Officer, Circle Internet Financial, Inc.) and Jerry Brito (Senior Research Fellow, The Mercatus Center, George Mason University). Ernie Allen began by addressing the quickening pace of innovation and pressed for global cooperation. Ernie stressed the need to ensure that any response from the government is not so draconian in nature. Ernie expressed his concerns relating to anonymity and stated that absolute internet anonymity is a set up for disaster. He emphasized that the committee cannot ignore the misuse of a digital currency but also acknowledged that Bitcoin is a global phenomena.\nPatrick Murck from the Bitcoin Foundation discussed the global role of the Bitcoin Foundation. He stressed that Bitcoin increases dignity, liberty and self determination as many people are not banked in the US and abroad. He acknowledged that Bitcoin can be used for illicit purposes but Bitcoin is based on decentralized systems of open ledgers which are open and transparent. He asserted that Bitcoin does NOT pose a threat to the legal community and also stated that the Bitcoin Foundation thanks FinCen and hopes to continue to move forward with an open dialogue. He stated that there is a real need to create on ramps into the traditional financial system to protect the system from abuse. Current obstacles include the current fear of most banks to work with Bitcoin related businesses.\nJeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle followed Patrick Murck and highlighted that digital currency represents one of the most important technological developments of our time.He emphasized that outside of virtual currencies, there are generally high transaction fees and long periods of time between money transfers. Jeremy did stress the need for clearer guidelines as regulatory uncertainty will hold companies back from utilizing Bitcoin. He also noted that we are at another 20 year start of journey of internet development and that the open nature of Bitcoin and its development is a very positive framework. There is still tension regarding the balance between regulation and anonymity, yet Bitcoin offers great potential to lower the fraud risk when conducting payments as Bitcoin reduces risk and increases consumer privacy and is not subject to chargebacks.\nJerry Brito of the Mercatus Institute concluded the panel and began by stating that Digital Currencies are not new. Bitcoin has prospects for enduring value and is the world\u2019s first completely decentralized global currency. Bitcoin makes possible transactions online that are peer to peer without chargebacks and little to no transaction fees. He agreed that there can be an assessment of the risks of emerging technologies but no need for new laws targeted at this specific technology. Jerry specifically highlighted that the US could lose a head start if regulations are slapped on to Bitcoin related businesses. Bitcoin is an open source project and community and currency providing more opportunities for consumers.\nThe final question of the hearing caused some laughter: \u201cWho is this Satoshi Nakamoto?\u201d Patrick Murck responded that \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto is the pseudonym for this person or group of people who wrote the white paper,\u201d and expressed that who Satoshi is, is largely irrelevant to the Bitcoin project moving forward as more than half the codebase has been written by others by this point. Senator Carper quoted Albert Einstein to conclude the hearing: \u201cIn adversity lies opportunity.\u201d\nWhat will come today with the Senate Banking hearing? Tune in at 3pm to see Bitcoin continue to dominate.\n", "year": 2013, "month": 11, "day": 19}

{"title": "The Psychology of Decimals", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/the-psychology-of-decimals-1384986908/", "birthday": "Nov 20, 2013  5:35 PM EST", "date": "2013-11-20 22:35:00", "content": "The Bitcoin Association of Australia\n@tristan_winters\n iceCUBED\nWith all the excitement of recent events it is easy to forget that the ecosystem around Bitcoin is still very young. The technology is less developed than our interest in it. This will change over time. In the interim, adoption is challenging.\nSoftware is routinely beta and layers are nascent. For the uninitiated Bitcoin can seem daunting and full of technical jargon. Among the most challenging intellectual leaps involves the decimal.\nEach Bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places (100,000,000 individual units). The fiat currency we have always known is divisible to only 2 decimal places. This represents a huge paradigm shift.\nSo Bitcoin is more perfectly divisible than any of its fiat monetary competitors. Theoretically, this is is a source of strength. However, there is a vast gap between theory and reality. For adoption: perception is reality. Perception is king.\nIn a recent interview, IBM executive Richard Brown made an interesting statement. He noted that, as an alt-coin example, Litecoin was \u201ctesting the idea that psychology matters.\u201d\nLitecoin\u2019s main differences are well known. Among these, the total number (nominal units) that will ever exist is 84 million, compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 21 million. Richard sees litecoin as testing the idea that \u201cif we have a larger nominal number of currency units, does that change people\u2019s behaviour?\u201d\nThis question has far reaching implications for adoption. At its heart lay the decimal place and the psychological impact of nominal representations of wealth.\nLitecoin to Bitcoin \u2013 A Numbers Game.\nTheoretically Bitcoin does not need any clones. With 21 million nominal units, divisible to 8 decimal places, it is more than capable of supporting a global economy. Nevertheless, Bitcoin is an open-source project. So, for better or worse, it has a potentially infinite number of copies.\nIn a marketing sense Litecoin has sought to define itself as the \u2018silver\u2019 to Bitcoin\u2019s \u2018gold\u2019. However, neither exists physically. So, network effects aside, they are interchangeable for a given user.\nA Game of Numbers \u2013 Perception Rules.\nNumbers, psychology and value all interact inside our minds. Research on pricing psychology suggests that numbers and their arrangement around the decimal place influence perceived value.\nAs the eyes move left to right, digits to the left of the decimal place are most significant for us. We have learnt to see these numbers as important. We have learnt to overlook anything laying to the right. This leads to an overall rounding-down effect in one\u2019s mind. The exception being \u2018special offer\u2019 situations, with numbers to the right of the decimal ending in seven or nine.\nAs Bitcoin increases in value, wealth representation necessarily moves to the right. An average weekly wage, for example, would now show a \u20180\u2019 digit to the left of the decimal place if represented in Bitcoins on current highs. If price creates expectancy then a \u20180\u2019 to the left is a big disappointment.\nOur perception of a given thing creates a price point: the point at which demand changes. Marketing research applied to this case suggests that perhaps Bitcoin\u2019s demand could be affected as units to the left increasingly comprise of zeros: an inevitable consequence of increasing valuations.\nPerhaps then, a user will irrationally tend towards participation in a network that denominates their worth with a bigger number. A user may tend towards the use of Litecoins, for example, out of a desire to own whole units. This would give the user a larger nominal representation of wealth, fewer zeros to the left and a greater psychological satisfaction.\nScientist and researcher Stanislas Dehaene notes that prices with precise numbers tend to make consumers uneasy. Prices are rounded to calm consumers and increase perceived value. Dehaene also notes that Rounded numbers convey value.\nA Bitcoin is only a mathematical construct. So as a representation of value it is incredibly precise. Allowing for protocol changes it has the potential to be even more precise. Bitcoins are anything but rounded. For the inexperienced this precision must be intimidating.\nUnless you hold the opinion that Bitcoin, purely disruptive, will sell itself, then it still faces significant challenges: its continued adoption not yet assured. People who have never given much thought to money, value transfer or distributed consensus are unlikely to immediately realise the implications of Bitcoin. Already software is aiming to work around such issues.\nSome Practical Approaches\nPhone apps like Bridgewalker aim to use Bitcoin as a \u2018behind-the-scenes\u2019 transfer tool, keeping balances denominated in fiat in the user interface. The Multibit and Electrum wallets show fiat denominations next to BTC balances.\nThere is also a trend towards denominating bitcoins in mBTC and uBTC. Still, handing over so much fiat to own a just small fraction of a purely digital unit is a challenging psychological barrier to breach. Especially given our current preconceptions as to money and value.\nIt may be the case that the Bitcoin network does not find its eventual long-term success as \u2018money\u2019 or \u2018currency\u2019 at all. Richard Brown believes that \u201cBitcoin\u2019s true significance lies in its potential as a global digital asset register\u201d. This is just another potentially revolutionary and disruptive use case. For Bitcoin, there are many.\nThe technological quantum leap here is not necessarily a new type of money. Rather, it is the ability to now achieve global consensus over a decentralized and distributed network without a trusted third party. This has many potential applications for various fields of endeavour.\nBut for now the focus is on the Bitcoin network as a payment system and the Bitcoins as money. Focus will remain on this application for the foreseeable future. If the network is to continue its growth then, for the moment, people need to be satisfied with the idea of Bitcoins as money.\nEmotion affects decision-making. Those working on the tools to aid Bitcoin ease-of-use and adoption must understand this. Emotion will affect an individual\u2019s decision to participate in the network. This same principle applies to an individual\u2019s view of these strange new units of account called \u2018Bitcoins\u2019 and the price they will pay for them.\nThe more creative ways we can find to deal with such esoteric nuances, the better. Bitcoin, after all, is full of them. In developing strategies it is important to be clear about the audience and their limitations in stepping outside their current understanding of \u2018money\u2019. Bitcoin will then remain awe-inspiring but cease to be baffling.\n(Note: Tweet me if you want/need sourcing).", "year": 2013, "month": 11, "day": 20}

In his opening statement Senator Mark Warner began the hearing and discussed his first encounter with wireless telephones in the early 1980s. He specifically stressed the need for open minds to hear about the potential and also the important ramifications around monetary policy and taxation related to Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. He stated that Bitcoin can radically transform central banks, monetary policy and also pose threats. Senator Warner expressed that Bitcoin is a currency that already has been monetized and is becoming more mainstream. Senator Dean Heller expressed that the US Senate should help maintain an environment that fosters growth and brings about understanding. Senator Merkley stated that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies take money and that \u201cvirtual currencies are completely a different animal.\u201d Senator Merkley emphasized that Bitcoin is absolutely fascinating and stated that Bitcoin is a functional and viable technology at this moment. Senator Kirk highlighted his concern that Bitcoin could lead to illegal and terrorist activities.\nThe First Panel began with Jennifer Shasky Calvery (Director, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) and concluded with David Cotney (Commissioner of Banks, Massachusetts Division of Banks).\nJennifer Shasky Calvery of FinCen highlighted that virtual currencies must be put in perspective in that virtual currencies have yet to take over traditional financial institutions. She stressed the need for each financial institution to operate within legal bounds and integrity. She stated that those institutions that chose to act outside of the law will be held accountable and used the example of Liberty Reserve. FinCen is the regulator for anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism, so they are unable to determine as to whether or not Bitcoin is an actual currency. FinCen first took note of virtual currencies back with E-Gold and placed virtual currencies under the guise of the AML framework.\nShasky Calvery also addressed the question of Bitcoin\u2019s volatility.\nDavid Cotney (Commissioner of Banks, Massachusetts Division of Banks) proceeded to testify on behalf of the conference of state banks and expressed the benefits of virtual currencies of speed, efficiency and lower transaction costs and also providing an outlet for the unbanked. State regulators are currently looking for an open dialogue. He stated the need for licensing for businesses and that enforcement is also a key part of state supervision. He stressed that cooperation is a hallmark of state supervision. Cotney specifically mentioned the SAFE Act and expressed that states are currently working to ensure that there is an appropriate level of regulations. Cotney mentioned that there is a big demand for more real time payments at lower transaction costs and how many in Europe and Canada are seeking out faster transaction times and expediency. Cotney is concerned most about consumer protection and fears irrevocability of transactions.\nSenator Mark Warner discussed the need to strike the right balance so we do not chase exchanges offshore and leave Americans unprotected. He asked the first two panelists if Bitcoin is a currency or simply an internet protocol. Senator Kirk specifically asked whether or not a specific terrorist group has used Bitcoin. Senator Merkley proceeded to ask about the centralized public ledger and wanted to know if the encryption of the code can be broken. He touched upon the hacking of BitFloor and of Insta-Wallet and proceeded to ask Shasky Calvery how hacks take place. Shasky Calvery explained that Bitcoin is the strongest form of cryptography to date. She highlighted the irrevocability of transactions. The Senators were trying to grapple with the fact that Bitcoin is complex in that it is not as traceable.\nSenator Heitkamp (D-ND) touched upon the practicality of Bitcoin and how it is emerging and may replace credit cards and other methods of payment. She stressed the difficulties in categorizing Bitcoin and the question of how to deal with Bitcoin when it becomes more of a common method of transaction. The more commonly accepted it is and the more available Bitcoin becomes, there will be a need for either fitting Bitcoin into a category or creating a new category. Shaskey Calvery highlighted how Bitcoin is going to be a nice experiment that completely fails or it will really take off. Senator Heitkamp mentioned the interesting challenge to come with Bitcoin related to capital gains taxes and financial reporting down the road.\nSenator Jerry Moran posted on Bitcoin Reddit requesting questions from his constituents and the Bitcoin community. His main question was related to the dangers of excess regulations and how there additionally may be inconsistencies between federal and state standards. Shasky Calvery expressed that there will be regulations abroad as well and that if US related Bitcoin businesses leave to escape regulations, they will still find regulations abroad.\nThe witnesses on the second panel included Tony Gallippi (Co-founder and CEO, BitPay, Incorporated), Sarah Jane Hughes (University Scholar and Fellow in Commercial Law, Indiana University Maurer School of Law), Mr. Paul Smocer (BITS President, Financial Services Roundtable), and Ms. Mercedes Kelley Tunstall Partner and Practice Leader, Privacy and Data Security Group, Ballard Spahr LLP.\nMr. Paul Smocer opened up the panel by stating that attempts to develop digital currencies have existed for decades and stressed the need to recognize that digital currency usage exists outside of traditional frameworks. He stated that one measure of a currency\u2019s success is the usability and how widespread it is. He acknowledged that digital currencies can provide access to the underbanked and also highlighted the example of M-Pesa in Kenya and also how digital currencies help individuals in oppressive regimes. He stated that digital currencies can pose significant marketing risks. He defined Bitcoin as a currency, depository system and a payment system.\nSarah Jane Hughes of Indiana University began her testimony by sharing of her father\u2019s early experience in cryptography. She stated that it is incredibly important to enforce AML, anti-terrorism and also current sanctions. She expressed that regulations need to be clarified so that \u201cbanks don\u2019t get cold feet.\u201d She also encouraged payment providers related to Bitcoin and virtual currencies to share user protection statements. She stressed the need for rigorous guidelines to prevent illicit use of Bitcoins.\nMs. Mercedes Kelley Tunstall of the Privacy and Data Security Group came down harder than expected on Bitcoin. She currently works with a number of clients on financial innovation issues. She stated that the United States has a long history around currencies but also highlighted some of the supposed shortcomings of Bitcoin related to anonymity, criminal use of Bitcoin and gaps in reliability. She specifically stated that Bitcoin is being used by criminals and terrorists and in order to get through this, the anonymity \u201cneeds to go.\u201d She expressed the need for a definition of what a virtual currency is and asked for stronger FinCen guidance and concluded that nothing will stop a US Bank or financial institution from getting into virtual currencies themselves.\nTony Gallippi Co-founder and CEO, BitPay concluded the panel strongly. He specifically stressed the role Bitcoin can play in creating jobs in the United States and around the world. Tony mentioned BitPay\u2019s over 12,000 merchants and also how BitPay strictly follows AML and KYC guidelines. He expressed that Bitcoin has invented something pretty amazing in transferring an asset immediately with no risk. He also emphasized that the credit card was not made for the internet. He stated that in order to assist the housing market, Bitcoin can be used when settling mortgages. He encouraged Congress to take a wait and see approach as Congress did with the internet. Tony highlighted that Bitcoin is a technology with tremendous cost-savings for businesses and consumers. When asked for further clarification, he stated that BitPay\u2019s transaction fee started as 1% compared to the 3-4% transaction fees of credit cards.\nSenator Merkley highlighted low transaction fees and how the concept of low transaction fees can change how we deal with credit card companies and banks. Senator Mark Warner compared telecom and asked whether virtual currencies can grow faster in third world countries. He expressed the need to get the balance right. He also asked if a stronger digital currency will emerge. Ms. Mercedes Kelley Tunstall responded that unless Silk Road incidents no longer persist, Bitcoin will not become mainstream. Senator Heitkamp expressed that the more we legitimize Bitcoin in regulation, the more we commercialize Bitcoin and legitimize Bitcoin as a true opportunity. Sarah Jane Hughes recognizes that this is a risk worth taking. Sarah Jane Hughes stated that right now, all risks fall on users. Senator Heitkamp recognized that it might make sense to just leave Bitcoin alone and see what happens.\nSenator Schumer (D-NY) expressed his different approach than Senator Heitkamp. Senator Schumer did state that he does not want to shut down or stamp out Bitcoin. He expressed that the rise of alternative currencies could have profound and exciting implications that Bitcoin has in NYC but also how this promise can be compromised by illicit activities. He asked Tony Gallippi as how we can separate illicit from licit Bitcoin related activity. Tony explained the different parts of Bitcoin: low level protocol and application. He explained that BitPay has a strict Know Your Customer policy and that those operating illicitly can get caught by law enforcement. Senator Schumer requested that Tony and the other panelists send specific suggestions as to how to weed out the illicit activity from the licit uses of Bitcoin.\nNow will the US House of Representatives follow suit and summon representatives from the Bitcoin community for a hearing on the House side?", "year": 2013, "month": 11, "day": 20}

Nowadays he works for the crowdfunding platform @goteofunding and as a advisor for social economy as well as social and cryptocurrency initiatives. You can reach him on Twitter at @ferranrego\nFreicoin is a Bitcoin-based currency that has a demurrage fee and zero interest, concepts proposed by Silvio Gesell to reduce hoarding and to promote the sharing of wealth. These theories have been used several times with fairly positive results.\nThe project is led by Jorge Tim\u00f3n and Mark Friedenbach. They launched a crowdfunding campaign to develop this currency, described by them as \u201ca decentralized, distributed electronic currency designed to address the grievances of the 99% and correct the excesses of the 1%.\u201d. They didn\u2019t achieve their target of 28.000$ but their purpose still stands. We spoke with Jorge Tim\u00f3n to know more about this project.\nFerdinand Reyes: What is Freicoin\u2019s stand about the never ending energy consumption\u2019s run for currency generation?\nJorge Tim\u00f3n: We tried to separate the miner\u2019s function as the way to make the system secure and, on the other hand, as a way to generate the initial units. Bitcoin joins them but we believe that while security is important, to issue all the money through miners is an energetic waste.\nFor this reason we are creating Freicoin Foundation in order to issue the currency at a lower cost than with mining; in our view currency shouldn\u2019t have a production cost.\nSCIP technology is also interesting. It was spoken about in the last Bitcoin conference at San Jos\u00e9. Is a technique that allows one to trust an untrusted computer executed a program properly with zero knowledge. This can be mining\u2019s future: instead of working out random hashes, all this computation power can be used for useful projects like volunteer computing. For instance, there is a group in Bitcoin\u2019s community, Curecoin, dedicated to collecting rewards for solving work units from Folding@home, a research project dedicated to finding cures to diseases.\nWe also support \u201cmerged mining\u201d, namely, mining multiple chains at once, instead of chains competing for proof-of-work, they can reuse the same work. Namecoin does that with Bitcoin already and Freicoin will too because they share the same SHA256 algorithm as proof-of-work in Bitcoin. Others like Litecoin replaced it with Scrypt and can\u2019t be merged mined.\nFR: What relationship do you have with the developers of Bitcoin?JT: Mark and I are subscribed to Bitcoin\u2019s development mailing list. We want to continue working with them, as they are the biggest development group. We want to keep the code as compatible as possible with Bitcoin to leverage the changes that we do to their codebase and conversely, to apply downstream changes at Freicoin by ourselves but if we have improvements that can affect to Bitcoin, we promote them to the main branch too.\nWe\u2019re a little slower at development since we need to apply our own changes on top of Bitcoin\u2019s last improvements, so we\u2019re almost always a version behind.\nFR: Freicoin has to do with social currency. What relationship do you have with them? What function does Freicoin?\nJT: Personally, complementary currencies have interested me for a long time. From Freicoin we think the interest can be fought in two ways; as Freicoin is a scarce currency, demurrage fee is required, but some local currencies are based on mutual credit and also result in zero interest currencies: even without demurrage fee they can suppress the basic interest.\nThey also have an important localization factor to create a more sustainable economy; in some sectors it is interesting and efficient to localize production and consumption, as in the case of food production. This can be achieved with local currencies but not with Freicoin, since it is a global P2P currency.\nFreicoin can complement social currencies helping them in the global market or, for example, allowing an immigrant to send money to another country; this can\u2019t be done with local currency but can be done with Freicoin. It would be a way for local currencies to be truly independent of national currencies like the euro or the dollar.\nWe should talk about FreiMarkets when talking about Freicoin\u2019s relation to other currencies. This is an extension of the protocol we are developing to allow issuing any local currency or even other assets that aren\u2019t currencies inside Freicoin\u2019s chain, and also in private servers. Local currencies\u2019 managers may not want to wait 10 minutes for confirmations because since their system are based on trust anyway, it\u2019s much easier for them to implement instant transactions.\nInside FreiMarkets you can issue social currencies in two ways: in private chains that instead of proof of work rely on a central accountant that users have to trust to prevent double-spoending, or issuing them in Freicoin\u2019s chain; a similar concept to Colored coins or Mastercoins, although they don\u2019t change Bitcoin protocol and they are limited in several ways. For instance, to exchange colored coins both parts must be online to sign simultaneously: an user can\u2019t use an order previously signed by someone who is now offline in colored coins like he can on Freimarkets or Ripple.\nTo implement this extension we are going to add the type of currency/asset at the beginning of the outputs. In this way, Freicoin\u2019s client will support any kind of different currencies; with or without interest/demurrage, for P2P loans, applying a basic income, ...\nFurthermore, in a single transaction, you could exchange between various currencies as in a P2P market like Ripple. For example, a person might pay with a local currency from Barcelona while the seller could receive Freicoin or another currency.\nWe are also working on a new type of unique non-fungible assets called tokens which will be more useful for opening a car, numbered seats in an event or any other non-fungible smart property use case.\nFR: What other projects does the Freicoin community have in mind?\nJT: Besides implementing FreiMarkets\u2019 already published design, we are working on the Freicoin Foundation\u2019s web to distribute freicoins through a faucet and among registered nonprofit organizations. The foundation will give to them in proportion to the donations they get by themselves. A total of 80,000,000 freicoins will be distributed, discounting what will be lost by demurrage during the process.\nThere are more proposals on how to distribute these funds without the foundation taking too many direct decisions and that are also easy to audit (the public blockchain helps a lot on this), but these two were the simpler and most feasible to implement in the short term.\nFR: At present Freicoin has little acceptance as currency and, being scarce, its implementation and circulation is slow. How do you think that associations may use it and what will you do to extend it?\nJT: If associations don\u2019t find where to spend their freicoins, they can exchange them for Bitcoins. Since Freicoin is a currency with demurrage fee, people will want it to change hands faster and this will accelerate its circulation. Merchants will be more open to accept them if they see people receiving and willing to spend freicoins.\nThese associations or other groups may also distribute them physically and give them practical use, as medium of exchange, among the members of a local community.\nFR: Finally, the short, medium and long term of Freicoin that you foresee.\nJT: We just published our FreiMarkets protocol extension proposal along with a crowdfunding campaign to develop it in the medium term. We think that it can be very well received by the Bitcoin community because we will start the merged mining, attracting more miners and avoiding having to hard-fork in the Bitcoin\u2019s chain to have a P2P markets with similar security.\nIn the short term, the Foundation\u2019s web will launch this fall and we hope to attract more people.\nMoreover, with more currencies and the bigger size of the block in the chain, the development done by Mark to allow clients to work without all the history with no loss of security will be interesting.\nMore personally, from a company I\u2019m creating with Mark, we want to create a website that encompasses an explorer, a pool and an exchange that allows payments with automatic conversion between Freicoin and Bitcoin. For example, if you have Freicoin deposits you can pay for a product or service with Bitcoin, exchanging the currency just before sending the transaction.\n\nThis interview has been published in Bitcoin Magazine, Issue 14\n", "year": 2013, "month": 11, "day": 22}

This is a big step forward into the world of Bitcoins: it gives access to almost 20,000 restaurants to pay with Bitcoin now.\nTakeaway.com is a Dutch dot-com company specialising in online food ordering and home delivery. Working as an intermediary online portal between the customer and the restaurants, customers can order food online from restaurants\u2019 menus, and have it delivered by the restaurants directly to their homes. The company was founded in the Netherlands by Jitse Groen, after an idea at a family celebration in 1999. He wanted to order food and thought he could find a restaurant with home delivery service on the internet. The only result posted on the internet was a list of restaurants in Amsterdam, where they could not order food at that time and for their current location.\nSo a year later he developed a website,Thuisbezorgd.nl(means \u2018home delivery\u2019) with the offer on it of take out restaurants who also deliver at home. This became a success and in 2007 the company expanded to Belgium, Germany and Austria. In 2010 they changed their name into Takeaway.com. Now they operate also in Denmark, France, Luxembourg, The United Kingdom, Suisse and in Vietnam. Takeaway.com works closely with brands like Coca Cola, Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Domino\u2019s Pizza and Heineken. Alltogether the website handles over 800,000 orders a month now, and they have over 20,000 restaurants that work with them. They are still developing and growing over 75% every year.\nI contacted the director and founder of Takeaway.com, Jitse Groen, to ask him some questions about the next big step at Takeaway.com: accepting Bitcoins.\nChristien Havranek: Why did Takeaway.com start with accepting Bitcoins as a valid payment?\nJitse Groen: Takeaway.com is always one of the first when it\u2019s going about new developments. Just after the launch of the first iPhone we had an iPhone app to use for ordering food. And also in the area of online payments we are almost always the first to add promising developments. We got a lot of clients who order food online because they are already situated behind the computer around dinnertime. Bitcoin is a beloved currency of a very important group of our customers: gamers. We regularly received the question if it was possible to accept Bitcoins. This was the main reason for us to add Bitcoin next to as a payment option.\nCH: What was the process going on between the idea of accepting Bitcoins and the acquittal of the currency?\nJG: After all the requests we received to accept Bitcoins, we did some research if there will be enough transactions with Bitcoins when we introduce them. It appeared that a relatively big group of regular applicants like to pay with them. So we decided to accept them. Between this decision and the implementation of the currency there was a timespan of one month. We launched the currency on the 5th of november 2013 in the Netherlands, Germany and Austria. Six days later it was also possible to pay for your pizza, burgers or other takeway food with Bitcoins at the food ordering sites of Luxembourgh, Belgium, France, The United Kingdom, Denmark and Suisse.\nCH: What are the expectations of Bitcoins for Takeaway.com?\nJG: We don\u2019t really know what to expect with Bitcoins for Takeaway.com. But we can say being happily suprised that already so many people pay their transactions with them now. Bitcoins take along a big currency risk. Sure this doesn\u2019t have to be bad, as long as [we\u2019re] taking the right prevention measures. This is the reason why we change them back to euro\u2019s as soon as we received them. So when Bitcoin loses its value, it would not affect Takeaway.com. That would especially be bad for the owners and speculators of them.\nCH: How many transactions have there already been done, for example, in the Netherlands?\nJG: We receive around a few hundred transactions a day. Compared to the myriads of orders we daily have in the Netherlands, it is just a very small amount. This phenomenon is the same in the other countries where we started accepting them. I can not tell you the exact amounts, but what I can tell you is that this number is already much higher than we expected.\nWhat you might be interested to know is the average amount of an order we receive on Bitcoins in most of the countries of Takeaway.com. This amount is a bit higher than the national average of them paid without Bitcoin.\nTable 1: An overview of the average amount of orders in different countries paid with Bitcoin.\nCountryAverage sum (EUR)Average sum (USD)Netherlands\u20ac20,82$28.11Belgium\u20ac18,43$24.88Germany\u20ac25,35$34.32Austria\u20ac17,49$23.61The UK\u20ac13,65$18.43France\u20ac30,80$41.59\nCH: Next to the nine European countries of Takeaway.com in Europe, you are also situated in Vietnam since the end of October after taking over Vietnammm.com. With around 700 members there at the moment, why don\u2019t you accept Bitcoin there as well?\nJG: This is a question of priorities at the moment. It\u2019s also due to another monetary unit. They are the only non Euro country of Takeaway.com. But who knows where Bitcoin will bring us in the future.\nAt least we are very happy that we took this step. We got a lot of positive reactions of Bitcoin users, thanks for that! We started as a student company with a start-up capital of just 50 euros and although we grew very big, we really appreciate the support from this party.\n\n(With special thanks to Jitse Groen, Takeaway.com, @takeaway.com on twitter for the picture, the quick online chatservice of Vietnammm.com and Wikipedia.)\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Christien Havranek has a background in Social Psychology and (Marketing) Communication.

Although the event will not be the first Bitcoin conference in the country, an honor that goes to the Bitcoin summit last month, it will be the first major conference in the country, attracting attendees from all around the world.\nThe location of the venue will be the Metro Toronto Convention Centre, the largest conference and meeting facility in Canada. The space will include four different theater rooms for presentations, and an exhibition hall that can house 20-40 exhibitors \u2013 roughly the same amount on both counts as the San Jose conference in 2013. Anthony Di Iorio, founder of the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada and chief organizer of the conference, expects that there will be \u201cupwards of seven hundred people\u201d present; however, he says, the conference will be able to expand and adjust if even more people choose to come. \u201cThe great thing about the vanue is that we have a lot of scalability,\u201d Di Iorio says.\nUnlike the Bitcoin summit in Toronto last month, which mainly targeted the Toronto Bitcoin audience with a few entrants from the United States, Di Iorio intends for this conference to be a major event, bringing in individuals, businesses and community organizations from all around the world. The speaker list will include:\nJoseph David, CEO of the largest Canadian Bitcoin exchange CaVirtexRodolfo Novak and Peter Gray from Coinkite, a company in Toronto developing Bitcoin wallet and merchant toolsStu Hoegner, Bitcoin Alliance of Canada legal counselAdam Levine, Stephanie Murphy and Andreas Antonopoulos from Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin, a popular weekly Bitcoin podcastCharles Hoskinson, head of the Bitcoin Education Committee and creator of the Udemy Bitcoin courseJonathan Mohan, Bitcoin community organizer in New YorkJeffrey Tucker from Laissez Faire Books, a book seller dedicated to selling books about libertarianism and free market economicsCody Wilson of Defense Distributed and more recently Dark WalletErik Voorhees (tentative) from Coinapult, a \u201csend Bitcoin by email\u201d service that is now reinventing itself as a full-scale Bitcoin exchangeJason King from the beloved Bitcoin homeless shelter Sean\u2019s Outpost\nAnd the list is not nearly complete; Di Iorio is currently actively looking for more speakers to attend, especially those from Europe and China. If anyone wants to speak but cannot afford to attend, the conference will also have a limited number of scholarships. Scholarships come in three levels: free registration only, partial (free registration plus a daily allowance) and full (free registration plus a daily allowance and travel costs), and will be decided on a competitive basis.

There will also be a full-scale event in Amsterdam in May organized by the Bitcoin Foundation, but it is far from certain that it will overshadow the other events to nearly the same extent that the Bitcoin conference in San Jose did in 2013; today, Bitcoin organizations other the Foundation have had plenty of time to catch up, and Bitcoin conferences are happening almost every month. It is quite likely that the Toronto conference will attract more of the Bitcoin audience from North America while the Amsterdam event will be more popular in Europe, although the organizers hope that as many people as possible will attend both.\n100% of the proceeds from the conference will go toward the supporting the Canadian Bitcoin community, and the exact way in which the funds will be distributed will be decided in a crowdsourced way by the organization\u2019s members. The Bitcoin Alliance of Canada will also soon make its formal announcement in several weeks, unveiling its new website and announcing a statement representing the organization\u2019s principles and beliefs \u2013 a move which Di Iorio believes the Bitcoin Foundation could also have benefitted from making when the organization first launched in September 2012.

This trajectory opened (and opens) new doors for people who have relied early on Bitcoin, for they may now be able to access this service for initial figures considerably lower than the US$ 250,000 current tour price.\n\u201cVirgin Galactic is the future of travel.

The company has exchanged those for dollars immediately to have no risk to comply with their refund policy.\nAn enterprise like Virgin accepting Bitcoin for one of its branches is a big push in the process of monetization of Bitcoin. In this particular case \u2013 if it were adopted among the Virgin Group holding \u2013 it could also be the entering of this currency into daily life businesses like groceries, telecommunications, energy, hospitality, music or transport.\nBranson envisions Virgin Galactic entering the international flights market, which could lead to Bitcoin\u2019s entry in another brand new market.

{"title": "Deterministic Wallets, Their Advantages and their Understated Flaws", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/deterministic-wallets-advantages-flaw-1385450276/", "birthday": "Nov 26, 2013  2:17 AM EST", "date": "2013-11-26 07:17:00", "content": "\ncIf you have been following the last year of progress in Bitcoin wallet development, you will have likely already heard of one of the latest trends in backend designbe: deterministic wallets. Unlike old-style Bitcoin wallets, which generate new Bitcoin addresses and private keys randomly as needed, in a deterministic wallet all of the data is generated using a specific algorithm from a single seed. That is to say, if you write down the seed to your deterministic wallet, and then after six months your hard drive gets corrupted and the wallet unrecoverable, you can simply create a new wallet using the same seed and all of the addresses and private keys from your old wallet will come back again exactly as they were before. This trend in wallet development has received near-universal praise, and nearly every Bitcoin client that intends to handle multiple addresses either already has a deterministic wallet implemented or is planning to create one.\nHowever, deterministic wallets in Bitcoin do not stop there. In fact, the latest deterministic wallets go beyond the simple design described above and have two key properties that are heavily advertised by their developers. The first of these properties is the concept of a \u201cmaster public key\u201c. A master public key is a key that can be generated from the wallet\u2019s master private key (either the same thing as the \u201cseed\u201d or a derivative of it) that has the power to generate all of the addresses in a Bitcoin wallet, but none of the private keys. Thus, someone with access to a master public key can look at the balance of a deterministic wallet, but cannot actually spend the balance because they have no way of generating the private key corresponding to each address. The second property is hierarchy: the private keys that you generate from a master private key are themselves master private keys and can in turn be treated as deterministic wallets in their own right.\nHow do Deterministic Wallets Work?\nAs it turns out, there are two major types of deterministic wallets currently in use: Electrum wallets and BIP32 wallets; they use a very similar algorithm, allowing them both to have the master public key property, although the BIP32 wallets go further by also including the hierarchy property \u2013 Electrum wallets are designed to only go down one level, although one certainly could extend the Electrum protocol to make it hierarchical as well.\nThe master public key property is perhaps the more surprising feature of deterministic wallets, and will be explored in detail first. The reason why it works is that Bitcoin public keys \u2013 not quite the same thing as Bitcoin addresses but a closely related form \u2013 can be added and subtracted just like normal integers can (although, notably, you cannot multiply two public keys together), and thus the same arithmetic operations can be done on two \u201clevels\u201d \u2013 to generate private keys, the arithmetic is done on the level of integers, and to generate public keys it is done on the level of public keys.\n\nThe precise algorithm used by all deterministic wallet systems is this. To calculate the private key at index i (say i = 5), calculate an \u201coffset\u201d parameter using a function (technically, a hash) of the index and the master public key. Then, simply add the master private key and the offset together. To calculate the public key at index i, calculate the offset in the same way, convert the offset to a public key, and add the master public key and the offset public key together.\nHere are a few examples using Electrum wallets, done with my own pybitcointools library. First, we generate a master private key and master public key from the seed:\n> seed = random_electrum_seed()'afc3eef71d96c468ca52b437c385a621'> mprivkey = electrum_stretch(seed)'5df10c922a1c7888b5c3a5a7106e72576f09c17f0993f4f2ce0ef5ccdb2f53c5'> mpubkey = '04'+electrum_mpk(mprivkey)'04fd6d91db1bdfc231116fd7d44c61a02e032b38b90aad419ecf75acf501eebdc7a0b7818e16a97a6c87693c723106e6fe17d4da743fae991139b05e6d1fe5c8a8'\nNow, we generate private key index zero:\n> offset = dbl_sha256('0:0:'+mpubkey[2:].decode('hex'))'429251ad9607fd39040072d23f53d54fc3b1ea526310fa45ca2a2df0629e2db2'> priv0 = add_privkeys(mprivkey,offset)'a0835e3fc02475c1b9c418794fc247a732bbabd16ca4ef38983923bd3dcd8177'\nNow, the public key:\n> pub0 = add_pubkeys(mpubkey,privkey_to_pubkey(offset))'04d96f3a8ebb0de48a98a5d77003c1d3ed5a36aae3eb20ee138a233e0c644becf77263c6e56cca6cfe064eb87582dcf92e9066d567ae0ffa67b0a5a4fda2bd7d68'> addr = pubkey_to_address(pub0)'14EkQ9qsKxWKiBJm5f7mT7ozSKKZbQoZGS'\nAnd, just to show you that the math checks out:\n> privkey_to_pubkey(priv0)'04d96f3a8ebb0de48a98a5d77003c1d3ed5a36aae3eb20ee138a233e0c644becf77263c6e56cca6cfe064eb87582dcf92e9066d567ae0ffa67b0a5a4fda2bd7d68'\nWe can repeat this with index 1, index 2, etc; you can try it yourself with your own Electrum wallet if you have one. The takeaway is this: you can safely give put your master public key in an insecure place, or even give it out to third parties like auditors, if it makes life more convenient for you; just keep the master private key (and the seed) to yourself.\nHierarchy\nNow, on to the hierarchical wallet property. This one is, once again, best described by simply showing it in action:\n> w = bip32_master_key('qweqweqweqweqwe')'xprv9s21ZrQH143K2KhRQVuMqhz798mvW89J1aJMWEKNfZzv3BPAgBc4TH59K8ZcLt8RrNJvbUzA72A92Grm3MorG2FnFaoZ7B8SDTYXgUBALoi'> w0 = bip32_ckd(w,0)'xprv9uyTuGongdyZAMxZ2euUBbpsAdtE2nxFBmcQn89UT4ZyzrMg5TXD7azCnsnpH9Q7yrYgG7nVakE6BTxJUarLrDA28VxS3ZWDsgYWZUxtNiH'> w000 = bip32_ckd(bip32_ckd(bip32_ckd(w,0),0),0)'xprv9zL8JVf2Us8VKFYoi3A8F3LSFuHnxNhAdVyrWuECgcbW13WcSrAZt9QxbbMvrFZsvUtrktVpNJ5iN1JhgUYDZoeXC5qtGfLuLw3reVWSRir'\nThe main use case for which this feature is advertised is in hierarchical organizations: the treasurer of a company might have control over the root private key of a BIP0032 wallet, and then hand off a \u201cchild\u201d seed to each of the company\u2019s departments who will then use that seed to operate their own wallet. The treasurer will have the master key to everything, but each department will only have the key to their own part of the funds.\nAnd, of course, BIP32 has that same master public key property as Electrum, but even stronger:\n> wp = bip32_privtopub(w)'xpub661MyMwAqRbcEomtWXSNCqvqhAcQuas9NoDxJcizDuXtuyiKDivK15PdAPVkPwVXT9rFbjAnE9P3sLh6xnDawXF1uUXrruH1UvALHF89qdP'> wp000 = bip32_ckd(bip32_ckd(bip32_ckd(wp,0),0),0)'xpub6DKUi1BvKEgnXjdGp4h8cBHAow8HMqR1ziuTKHdpEx8UsqqkzPUpRwjSStDzFc5ALo93wyYXmRr9rvXWcrfw5MPFKCET11KFg3kNrESyWZ6'> wp000_2 = bip32_privtopub(w000)'xpub6DKUi1BvKEgnXjdGp4h8cBHAow8HMqR1ziuTKHdpEx8UsqqkzPUpRwjSStDzFc5ALo93wyYXmRr9rvXWcrfw5MPFKCET11KFg3kNrESyWZ6'\nThus, a BIP32 master private key can be thought of being at the top of an infinitely descending tree, capable of recovering every private key below it. And a BIP32 master public key is just the same, except it can only recover public keys and addresses. Another metaphorical way to think about it is in terms of the private keys sitting at the canopy level of a rainforest, and the public keys on the ground below them. You can navigate the same path on the private key and public key level, and no matter where you jump down your destination will be the same, but once you\u2019re on the ground you can\u2019t get back up (tree-climbing monkeys that can go up from the public key ground level to the private key canopy are, at least for now, purely theoretical).\nAn Understated Problem\nFrom the descriptions we saw above, you likely understand that deterministic wallets have two properties. First, you can go from a parent key to a child key, but not in reverse. Second, you can give out your master public key with no risk to your funds \u2013 only your privacy. And this is how nearly all people, at least those technically skilled enough to know what a deterministic wallet is, view BIP0032 wallets today. The model of a company, which hands out child private keys to departments and master public keys to accountants and auditors, has come to take a central place in the mythology around the promise that BIP0032 wallets potentially hold. However, as we will see below, this description of hierarchical wallets is fatally flawed.\nThe problem is this: although you certainly can securely hand out child keys with no risk to the parent key, and you can hand out master public keys with no risk to the master private key, you cannot do both at the same time. The exploit for when that situation does arise is actually quite simple, and can be done with two lines of pybitcointools code. I will use Electrum in this example, since Electrum wallets are more transparent. These are the same master public key and child private key I created above:\n> mpubkey'04fd6d91db1bdfc231116fd7d44c61a02e032b38b90aad419ecf75acf501eebdc7a0b7818e16a97a6c87693c723106e6fe17d4da743fae991139b05e6d1fe5c8a8'> priv0'a0835e3fc02475c1b9c418794fc247a732bbabd16ca4ef38983923bd3dcd8177'\nAs we saw above, the first private key is calculated by a formula which can be summarized as mprivkey + calc_offset(mpubkey,index). So, what do we do? If you look for it closely, the answer is surprisingly obvious:\n> offset = dbl_sha256('0:0:'+mpubkey[2:].decode('hex'))'429251ad9607fd39040072d23f53d54fc3b1ea526310fa45ca2a2df0629e2db2'> mprivkey_2 = subtract_privkeys(priv0,offset)'5df10c922a1c7888b5c3a5a7106e72576f09c17f0993f4f2ce0ef5ccdb2f53c5'\nAnd tada, we get the master private key back. Now, we can go ahead and pilfer all of the other addresses in the wallet, even those which the wallet\u2019s owner never intended to touch. I even included a command in pybitcointools to make this more convenient for you:\n> crack_electrum_wallet(mpubkey,priv0,0)'5df10c922a1c7888b5c3a5a7106e72576f09c17f0993f4f2ce0ef5ccdb2f53c5'\nBIP32 has the same vulnerability:\n> wp = bip32_privtopub(w)> w0 = bip32_ckd(w,0)> crack_bip32_privkey(wp,w0)'xprv9s21ZrQH143K2KhRQVuMqhz798mvW89J1aJMWEKNfZzv3BPAgBc4TH59K8ZcLt8RrNJvbUzA72A92Grm3MorG2FnFaoZ7B8SDTYXgUBALoi'\nIn the interests of fairness, it is important to note that this is not a sudden new zero-day vulnerability discovery; many Bitcoin developers have known about this for a while. However, given the intuitive understanding of hierarchical deterministic wallets that many people implicitly promote, including the idea of handing out child private keys to organization departments and master public keys to auditors, this has a great potential to result in a security breach. It may only be a matter of time until a large organization decides to actually adopt a hierarchical deterministic wallet to protect its Bitcoin funds, and suddenly finds a collusion of one of its department heads and an auditor running off with the entire company funds. So the obvious question is: can this be fixed? The answer seems to be no; because the only operations that can be done with public keys is adding and subtracting them, the only way to implement a deterministic wallet with the master public key property is using the \u201coffset\u201d mechanism described here. If this is indeed true, then raising awareness is the only solution, together with a change in BIP32 representation and in clients to make it clear that master public keys and hierarchical wallets do not mix.\nThere is one clever way in which this might be bypassed: making three hierarchical BIP32 wallets, with every address being a 2-of-3 multisignature address between the three wallets down some particular child key derivation path. Then, an auditor can have one of the three master public keys, and search the blockchain for transactions whose script contains public keys generated from that master public key. The solution is complex, not supported by any existing client, and far from perfect, but something like it seems to be the only way to get around the issue. In most cases, however, simply not handing out the master public key may be the better approach.\nSo what is the future of deterministic wallets? At this point, BIP0032 is arguably as far as we can go; there are no known tricks in elliptic curve math that haven\u2019t been exploited yet. One obvious upgrade might be BIP0032 multisignature wallets, combining BIP0032\u2019s hierarchical deterministic magic with an advanced feature in Bitcoin that allows you to send bitcoins to an address that requires two out of three given private keys to spend the funds. Another further direction is brainwallets. The two current competitors for memorizing a Bitcoin wallet are (1) choosing a password and using the password or a hash of the password as a seed, and (2) randomly generating a seed and converting the seed into a passphrase in a way that can be reversed. The way that both approaches are implemented is currently somewhat flawed \u2013 the standard implementation of the first approach does far too little against brute force attacks, whereas the standard (Electrum) implementation of the second approach is too difficult to memorize \u2013 studies show that passphrases like \u201cglow date cost bloody curve wheel cousin picture ring finally bubble press\u201d are no easier to memorize than random strings of characters of an equal security level, and they offer no protection against forgetting one or two words. These are open problems \u2013 if you are a Bitcoin developer, you personally have the opportunity to come up with and standardize a solution.", "year": 2013, "month": 11, "day": 26}

Ploshay (Bitcoin Magazine)\nBitcoin has become so popular today in China that even Damas (Chinese aunts who dance in the square) are talking about it. Chances were rare, however, of hearing about Bitcoin in China two years ago. Just two years ago, it was very exciting to meet someone sharing the same interest in Bitcoin.\n8BTC.com was like a sloop when first established in 2011. It was not before too long that 8BTC received the first donation from QQagent, the moderator of the Chinese sub-forum of Bitcointalk, as well as the Chinese translator of Satoshi\u2019s Bitcoin White Paper. I never met him in person, yet we still trusted each other and believed the Age of Exploration for Bitcoin was coming. Lao Duan, who was one of the first Bitcoiners, a famous blog writer and the founder of the first Bitcoin fund in China, also joined us later on. The sloop was upgraded to a brig as we updated our domain name and network host. We went through these changes in 2011 together, when the fervor of Bitcoin quickly reached its peak and subsided even quicker. Today QQagent and Lao Duan both left 8BTC due to personal reasons, yet they are always remembered on our About Us page on our website.\nIn 2013 Bitcoin became famous again in public, while more and more sailors were joining 8BTC. For example, Wuwangbuhuan joined 8BTC as both our pen names appeared in the same report and I was quite impressed by his insight. Really and BigChubbyCat joined 8BTC despite our differing opinions. They were fanatic Hayek advocates while I disagreed with the understanding of Hayek. Shuikongkong, Songhuanping, Atrax and James also then joined 8BTC, as we all participated in the collective writing of the book \u201cBitcoin- An Open-Source Experience of Money\u201d.\nLi Jun is also a special member among our writers, as he initiated the campaign of writing the first book of 8BTC about Bitcoin. I appreciated his plan of co-writing the book and together we invited friends to join the campaign, to finish the book with great enthusiasm. We had no intention of reaching consensus on the content, but rather tried to show different perspectives and thoughts. That\u2019s why you can see different or even opposite views in this book, just like what Bitcoin communities show us \u2014 an open self-organized system accepts supports from all sectors to develop.\nThe same principle applies to the organization of 8BTC. Critics of Bitcoin as well as of myself are invited to join 8BTC. There was a dispute of copyright between 8BTC and its competitors in August 2013, while BigChubbyCat and Hu Yilin objected openly to the BY-NC-SA (Attribution \u2013 Non-commercial \u2013 Share-alike) agreement of 8BTC. I was quite upset at first but still chose to respect their choice. Consequently they could make a copyright statement to allow redistributing their articles on other websites, or choose not to display the sidebar of WordPress when publishing their articles on 8BTC. By doing so, the advertisements of 8BTC are not displayed in the pages of their articles, meaning that they refuse to receive sponsorship from the revenue generated by the advertisements of the website and they are thus not bounded by the BY-NC-SA agreement.\n8BTC is like a Flemish galleon now, with more than thirty writers. Our 8BTC website is run by the enthusiasm of volunteers, as most of us write the articles in our free time. It was Shen Bo who told me that 8BTC had the potential to become a great ship and helped to make a closer connection between 8BTC and the Bitcoin community. Thanks to the assistance of Elizabeth, we are about to establish a long-term cooperation with Bitcoin Magazine. James and I as well as other 8BTC members will write in the columns on Bitcoin Magazine and introduce the information and news from the Chinese Bitcoin community. Meanwhile 8BTC will also help to promote the use of education resources Bitcoin Foundation and Bitcoin Education Committee to China, as well as translate the content of Bitcoin Magazine into Chinese.\nIn the past two years, some members have left 8BTC while some others have joined us. This is similar to the Bitcoin network where some nodes go offline and new ones go online, yet the system is still running well. We are implementing the idea of distributed autonomous corporation (DAC) unconsciously. Currently Baozougongqinwang, one of our famous members, is planning to set up a digital-money investment fund. Really and Juxie are making their efforts to promote derivative applications of Bitcoin like Mastercoin and Bitshares. Li Jun and Wuwangbuhuan are establishing a consulting firm. Thanks to the relatively loose regulation, the prospect of Bitcoin in China is promising. As a pirate ship in the Age of Exploration for Bitcoin, 8BTC hopes to help its members to reach their own docks.", "year": 2013, "month": 10, "day": 30}

The local Bitcoin economy is the healthiest it has ever been. Its newly incorporated custodians \u2013 The Bitcoin Association of Australia \u2013 plan on keeping it that way.\nA talented team of Bitcoiners has assembled and incorporated Australia\u2019s not-for-profit organisation, preserving, protecting and nurturing the community down-under. While, at the same time, forming strong international alliances and regional bonds.\nThey are currently over-seeing a host of important projects.\nThe Association\u2019s governing committee consists of entrepreneurs and developers with both breadth and depth of experience. Specifically:\nMartin Bajalan: A B.Sc. in applied mathematics with 14 years experience managing and developing enterprise level software products in payment processing. Martin is developing a trading platform for digital currencies, launched in September 2013.\nMax Kaye: A programmer with a vast array of experience dealing with crypto-based technology; running a NMC/BTC mining pool and experimenting with trustless exchange.\nAdam Poulton: An entrepreneur holding a Degree in Applied Science with a strong interest in money and macroeconomics. Martin is developing a Bitcoin startup, currently in beta, designed to integrate Bitcoin into people\u2019s daily lives.\nPantelis Roussakis: A digital marketing strategist and consultant for business and government. Pantelis is building the Artbits project. With a view to help artists leverage digital currency, by bypassing the arbitrary penalties imposed by the archaic financial system.\nBret Treasure: An online marketing consultant and Chairman of the Australian Web Industry Association. Bret brings years of experience with foundations and virtual payment systems.\nLeo Treasure: A long-time active participant in the Bitcoin community; mining, investing and making Bitcoin themed electronic music. Leo is currently importing 25 Lamassu machines into Australia.\nJason Williams: A developer heavily involved in emerging technologies from their early stages, including cable Internet. Jason is the prime organiser of the Bitcoin Sydney meet-ups. He is also responsible for Australia\u2019s first bricks and mortar Bitcoin establishment and coding their POS.\nTristan Winters: An agricultural commodities trader holding degrees in law and economics. Tristan is a self-described libertarian. He is actively involved in the Bitcoin community in Australia and Europe, across several projects. Including the libbitcoin implementation of the Bitcoin protocol.\nIn Australia there exists an excellent opportunity to develop Bitcoin in the Commonwealth and the Asia-Pacific region. This is the Association\u2019s focus.\nThere has been little in the way of legal guidance thus far. It is certain, however, that authorities are aware of the existence of crypto-currency and are monitoring it closely.\nThe Association\u2019s Martin Bajalan describes an interesting though not unfamiliar experience establishing an exchange in Australia. The organization in charge of AML/KYC in Australia is called Austrac and generally any financial organization would have to register with them and follow AML policies.\nIn contacting Austrac, in order to help classify Bitcoin markets as one of the existing categories of financial services, the response from Austrac has been consistent. That is: \u201cBitcoin is not backed either directly or indirectly by precious metal or bullion and therefore such digital currency is not covered by the AML/CTF Act\u201d.\nThe Act was created in 2006, with an expiry date of 2013. Bitcoin\u2019s genesis was in the interim. So it is reasonable that the previous act did not cover Bitcoin. Max Kaye of the Association notes that The Act is \u201coutdated\u201d and the Association is dedicated to helping bring it into the modern era \u201cas Bitcoin-positive as it can be\u201d.\nThe association respects the revolutionary promise of Satoshi\u2019s original protocol. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily averse to engaging authorities, where appropriate. It is certainly a delicate balance to strike.\nExchange and kiosk machines are probably the most difficult part of the regulatory landscapes to navigate. In showing a commitment to maintaining proper compliance, Martin Bajalan, by example, is working with a leading organization in ID verification. The company is approved by the Government and assists in maintaining compatibility with Austrac for AML/KYC regulations.\nOverall, the Association\u2019s leadership is capable, bringing hope for peace and progress with Australian regulators.\nFor now the Australian Foundation will direct its attention in three fundamental directions. Firstly: education, as a means of awakening the people to the importance of crypto-currency. For their lives, their prosperity and the future their children will inherit.\nSecondly: the Foundation will, where needed, face regulators confidently. They will no doubt desire to preserve their old and enduring values and institutions. The Association will take them in its capable hands and lead them to the future.\nThirdly: project development. Bitcoin is, fundamentally, an open-source project and the most promising peer-2-peer network on earth. This is its source of strength. The Association will foster projects that capitalize on that strength.\nBig government is a concern for Bitcoin globally. It is no different in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region. With capable foundational leadership the Australian Association is facing this peril head-on.

Bitcoin is such a unique decentralized product that anyone can get involved to develop code, or set up a node, or process trading data by completing the computing tasks within the network, but no individual or organization can really dominate Bitcoin, even founder Satoshi Nakamoto himself. Some believe the true identity of Satoshi is a collection of three individuals, as an uncommon scientific phrase appeared both in the Bitcoin White Paper and in a patent application filed by those three people. It can also be noted that the Bitcoin White Paper is written in the first person \u201cwe\u201d rather than \u201cI\u201d.\nWikipedia, run by only five people, is similar to Bitcoin as it promotes decentralization and has removed the fence of professional institutions, inviting everyone to be involved in the field of knowledge, thus making it possible for individuals to complete epic projects of knowledge via large-scale cooperation. Bitcoin, administrator-less, breaks the monopoly of financial Brahmans and creates a decentralized reality of millions of LSI devices defeating a central server guarded by high-ranked flamens via distributed self-organization.\nWikipedia is a 24/7 library that never closes and can be viewed and edited at any time. Likewise, Bitcoin is the global cloud online 24/7, with no more frustrating \u201cnon-business hour\u201d roadblocks. The large-scale cooperation of both Wikipedia and Bitcoin is quite open-ended. As long as a page of Wikipedia is not locked, anyone can edit it to make it more accurate. In Bitcoin communities, anyone can code, develop applications and can work towards greater security. Both have endogenous mechanisms of motivation. The activists in the Wikipedia community can gain more respect and approval of articles by voting. Wikipedia is based on sharing knowledge. In the Bitcoin economy, miners mine to process trading data and provide computing power, while at the same time gaining Bitcoin in payment. The voting right represented by the computing power bestows the mine\u2019s strong sense of citizenship. Their responsibility and motivation help secure the whole network of Bitcoin and disincentivizes a 51% attack.\nThe result of self-organization is specialization. There are three types of protections in Wikipedia: full, semi, and move. An administrator has a strict framework to prevent trolls from making non-constructive edits, while super users can block the trolls according to advice from elite editors. In the world of Bitcoin, the flat distributed network is under quiet transformation. Some nodes may have more connections, more computing power, or other functions that an ordinary client doesn\u2019t have. Bitcoin has some ASIC devices with tremendous hash rate, public wallets with blockchain.info, wallets set to receive interest from a Bitcoin bank, mobile clients on smart phones, or offline wallets with a cold storage mechanism.\nSpecialization also brings efficiency, which is an old rule of economy that still applies in open-ended self-organized projects. The users of Bitcoin realize that it is not necessary for everyone to download the blockchain. Everyone just needs an online wallet or light clients. Also it is not required for everyone to become a miner. Electronic wallets are not even necessary, as some prefer to remember a private key in mind, making it impossible for anyone to find the treasure some hide in any physical storage equipment. It can\u2019t be denied, however, that physical storage is part of the Bitcoin economy. Like the big stone accidentally lost in the sea by people on Yap Island, cold storage wealth should be considered valid. Some don\u2019t even like the concept of Bitcoin but still can use the blockchain and Namecoin, a distributed domain name system that merged with Bitcoin blockchain by merged mining. Individuals who understand Bitcoin can create new currencies like colored coin, Mastercoin and Bitshares. These variants of Bitcoin can perform financial functions such as distributed stocks, futures, and Bitcoin assets linked to real world currency. Such variants of Bitcoin are undeniably part of the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nI personally initiated a campaign of writing the first book on Bitcoin in China not long ago, and the process was totally decentralized. This book was written by more than ten members of the Chinese Bitcoin community from China Business Network and 8btc (www.8btc.com). There was no unified theme nor tight organization. The views of the writers were quite different and at times even contradictory. Yet, a difference in views has not stopped us from completing the book. This book represents a small-scale open-ended cooperation, as well as a critical thinking experiment. Similar to Bitcoin, all ideas can be included in an open platform to continue to evolve to highlight the essence of an open self-organization.\n", "year": 2013, "month": 10, "day": 29}
{"title": "Shedding Light on the Dark Wallet", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/shedding-light-on-the-dark-wallet-1383357523/", "birthday": "Nov 1, 2013  9:58 PM EST", "date": "2013-11-02 02:58:00", "content": "Disclaimer: Vitalik Buterin and Mihai Alisie have some involvement in the Dark Wallet project\nThe Bitcoin Dark Wallet has been all the rage in the Bitcoin news these past few days. While the media was abuzz with claims that Bitcoin is finally abandoning its cryptoanarchist past and going mainstream, and cashless society advocate David Wolman writing an article in Wired calling for increased centralization, this collaboration between Cody Wilson\u2019s Defense Distributed, unSYSTEM and Coinpunk seems to have fired a shot out of left field in the exact opposite direction. In the project\u2019s Youtube video and project page, its organizers have denounced the Bitcoin Foundation as \u201ca group of corporations and lobbyists \u2026 trying to both agree with and maintain an independence from regulatory power\u201d, accused Bitcoin developers like Mike Hearn of \u201cactive collusion with law enforcement\u201d and created and advertised a project to make a wallet with the explicit intent of \u201clocking out the State [and] flipping the channel to one beyond observation\u201d. The project page lists dozens of articles and manifestos on topics ranging from open source software to direct democracy and anarchism and links to examples of what the Dark Wallet\u2019s creators see as explicit attempts by the \u201ccore\u201d Bitcoin community to marginalize the radical extremes.\nAmidst all of the ideological grandstanding and inevitable backlash, however, there has been surprisingly little talk of what the Dark Wallet actually is, and what Amir Taaki, Cody Wilson and its other creators intend to achieve on a practical level. At the core, Dark Wallet is going to be a Bitcoin wallet that exists entirely as a Chrome and Firefox browser extension, allowing Bitcoin users to make payments online much more conveniently than was possible before. Imagine double-clicking on a Bitcoin address, double-clicking on a price, and being able to send the payment right there. No tab opening or separate applications required. Currently, there is only one browser-extension Bitcoin wallet that continues to be seriously maintained, blockchain.info, and its interface is essentially equivalent to a web page; Dark Wallet, on the other hand, will be the first wallet to take the concept of an in-browser wallet and truly bring it to the next level.\nSecond, and arguably more important, is the \u201cdark\u201d part of Dark Wallet. In what way exactly is Dark Wallet dark? The answer is simple: built-in trustless mixing. Mixing services in general are an essential complement to the anonymity properties that Bitcoin has today to preserve privacy. The problem that they solve is this: although Bitcoin allows anyone to easily create an account and start making transactions without providing any personal information whatsoever, what it does not do is hide the actual transactions. Every transaction that takes place through the Bitcoin network is public, and is remembered in the Bitcoin blockchain in perpetuity. Using this information, in theory it may be quite possible to de-anonymize some Bitcoin users after some time. In practice, mathematical analyses done by university research departments over the past two years have managed to successfully identify the Bitcoin exchange MtGox, the now-defunct online black market Silk Road and other large businesses, so the worry is that it is only a matter of time until smaller and smaller Bitcoin users start to be de-anonymized as well.\nThe way a traditional, centralized mixing service works is that it provides the user with an address to send bitcoins to, waits for the user to do so, and then sends an equal number of bitcoins (or perhaps minus a small fee), but from a different source, to the user\u2019s desired destination address. The mixing service then deletes all of the data about the transaction once all the funds have been sent out. Because the user gets back different bitcoins from what they put in, the theory goes, mixing services break a blockchain sleuth\u2019s ability to trace money through the system. The most popular mixer today is operated by blockchain.info, and charges a 0.5% fee for the service.\nHowever, there are obvious problems with centralized mixing. The two most serious problems both revolve around the issue of trust. When you send money to blockchain.info, blockchain.info can theoretically simply keep the funds for themselves; you would have no way of proving that you sent money into the mixer, as the whole point of the mixer is to anonymize as much as pssible and leave no traces. More importantly, however, you can never be sure that blockchain.info actually deletes the data about transactions through the system once they send out the funds. Blockchain.info may well be quietly collecting the data, and selling it to the Chinese government \u2013 or simply giving it to the US government, under the force of a secret government subpoena or a national security letter. And finally, but somewhat more mundanely, centralized mixers often charge high fees; blockchain.info\u2019s 0.5% is actually on the low side.\nHow can these problems be fixed? In essence, the answer is decentralized mixing. It is possible to create a mixing service with no central party, where users download specialized Bitcoin clients which come together on a chat channel over the encrypted Tor network and create a mutually anonymizing transaction with each other. If the process is done right, none of the users would be able to tell which output of the resulting mix belongs to whom. The simplest way to accomplish such a thing in practice is using the CoinJoin protocol, developed by Gregory Maxwell; two months ago, Amir Taaki and Pablo Martin created the first truly practical implementation of the protocol. In Dark Wallet, however, Taaki and Martin intend to take trustless mixing to the next level: the mixer would be integrated directly into the wallet, so its users can simply use the wallet and benefit from the privacy that trustless mixing offers automatically.\nThe third major feature of Dark Wallet will be a built-in identity system. The identity system will serve two purposes. First, it will serve as an alternative to traditional password-based and social network-based authentication schemes. Instead of relying on one of those schemes, authentication through Dark Wallet would be done with a relatively simple cryptographic protocol. When a user registers with a site compatible with the Dark Wallet authentication scheme, the wallet would send to the site the user\u2019s public key. When a user wants to log in, the site would send the user\u2019s wallet a message, the user\u2019s Dark Wallet would sign the message with the user\u2019s private key and send back the signature, and the site would verify the signature against the public key (for more on how public key cryptography works, see the Wikipedia article on the subject, or my own recent piece which, among other things, looks into the public key cryptography used in Bitcoin). Hopefully, some Bitcoin sites will be persuaded to adopt the scheme.\nFurther in the future, however, the identity system may serve as the basis for a cryptographically secure social network \u2013 which could then be used to implement the holy grail of \u201cdark\u201d privacy and security: a fully decentralized, private and uncensorable crypto-market, with a powerful reputation system for consumer protection built in. Will such a crypto-market be \u201cjust for drugs\u201d? Just like Bitcoin, probably not; regular users can still benefit from such a market\u2019s near-zero fees, friendliness to automation and the assurance that there is no central third party that they need to trust to keep the market online and not defraud them.\nUltimately, however, the Dark Wallet project is about more than just the wallet. As Amir Taaki describes it, the ultimate aim is to build a community, which will stick together and continue to develop tools for the Bitcoin community even after the original project is done. \u201c[I want to] create an environment where creativity and merit thrive,\u201d Taaki explains. \u201cSo, create the space where we can operate, put all the talented people there, and the magic will happen by itself. Planning is premature because maybe everyone else has different ideas on how things will go.\u201d Alongside Dark Wallet, some of the other projects that will take place include a concerted effort to bridge together the Python Bitcoin software tools (currently consisting of Electrum, Robert Williamson\u2019s Block Alchemy, Pablo Martin\u2019s pure python ZeroMQ implementation and Obelisk client and my own pybitcointools, among many others), development on libbitcoin and SX and the continued effort to convert the project\u2019s de-facto homebase, Calafou, into a fully-fledged unSYSTEM project incubator. \u201cThis is the story we need to get out,\u201d Taaki writes, \u201cone of cooperation and mutual solidarity between competitors finding middle ground to make effective use of resources. This is the power and beauty of openness.\u201d\nIs the project\u2019s extremist ideological marketing and image unnecessarily repelling people who would otherwise be interested in cooperating? Perhaps so. On the other hand, Dark Wallet has already been covered by Forbes and the project has received over $20,000 in donations in under two days. Furthermore, one of the project\u2019s partners, Coinpunk, is the recipient of a grant from the very same Bitcoin Foundation that Taaki and Wilson are so keen to criticize. Perhaps, beneath the disagreements and the rhetoric, there is a set of common ideals shared by many members of unSYSTEM and the Bitcoin Foundation alike, and there is actually much more room for cooperation between the business-focused entrepreneurial community and the cryptoanarchists, the seemingly two great factions of the Bitcoin divide, than we think.", "year": 2013, "month": 11, "day": 2}
{"title": "Selfish Mining: A 25% Attack Against the Bitcoin Network", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/selfish-mining-a-25-attack-against-the-bitcoin-network-1383578440/", "birthday": "Nov 4, 2013  10:20 AM EST", "date": "2013-11-04 15:20:00", "content": "One of Bitcoin\u2019s core security guarantees is that, for an attacker to be able to successfully interfere with the Bitcoin network and block and reverse transactions, they need to have more computing power than the rest of the Bitcoin network combined. The reason for this is that the Bitcoin network builds up its transaction history in the form of a \u201cblockchain\u201d, with a random node adding a new block on top of the previous block every ten minutes. To reverse a transaction, an attacker would need to make a transaction and then \u201cfork\u201d the blockchain one block behind the block the transaction was included in \u2013 from which point the attacker would be in a computation race against all of the other miners combined as he attempts to catch up. A new paper by Cornell University researchers Ittay Eyal and Emin Gun Sirer, however, significantly reduces Bitcoin\u2019s security guarantee by introducing another type of attack \u2013 an economic attack. The economic attack does not allow hostile miners to mount successful attacks against Bitcoin unilaterally, but it does change the incentives such that normally honest, profit-maximizing nodes would want to join the attacker\u2019s coalition, potentially allowing for 51% attacks as a second stage.\nThe high-level overview of the attack is this: rather than acting as a normal miner and publishing blocks to the network immediately upon finding them, the attacker selectively publishes blocks, sometimes sacrificing his own revenue but also often publishing many blocks all at once and thus forcing the rest of the network to discard blocks and lose revenue. This does reduce the attacker\u2019s revenue in the short term, but it reduces everyone else\u2019s revenue even more, so neutral nodes now have the incentive to join the attacker\u2019s coalition to increase their own revenue. Eventually, the attacker\u2019s coalition would expand to above 50% in size, potentially giving the attacker a high degree of control over the network.\nThe attacker\u2019s precise strategy is as follows. The attacker keeps track of its own \u201cprivate chain\u201d, which is separate from the \u201cpublic chain\u201d that the rest of the network works on. At first, the private chain and the public chain start out the same. The attacker always mines on the private chain and keeps any blocks that he finds private. The strategy dictates exactly when the attacker should publish blocks. Suppose the attacker\u2019s portion of the network hashpower is X, and when there are two competing public chains the portion of the network that picks up on the attacker\u2019s chain is Z.\nState 0: If the attacker\u2019s private chain is the same as the public chain, mine on the private chain. With probability X, the attacker discovers a block and advances to state 1 (private chain 1 block ahead). With probability 1-X, the public network discovers a block, and the attacker resets his private chain to the public chain.State 1: If the attacker\u2019s private chain is 1 longer than the public chain, mine on the private chain. With probability X, the attacker advances to state 2 (private chain 2 blocks ahread). With probability 1-X, the public network discovers a block, setting the system to state 0\u2032.State 0\u2032: The attacker publishes his block. There are now two competing chains, both one block long. With probability X, the attacker will discover another block, causing the network to switch over to the private chain. The attacker gains a revenue of 2, and the system resets to state 0. With probability (1-X)Z, the network finds a block on top of the attacker\u2019s block. The attacker and the network gain a revenue of 1, and the system resets to state 0. With probability (1-X)(1-Z), the network finds a block on top of its own block, the network gains a revenue of 2 and the system resets to state 0.State 2: With probability X, the attacker advances to state 3 and earns a revenue of 1 (technically, the attacker will earn the revenue later, but it\u2019s easier to account for it here). With probability 1-X, the network finds a block, so the attacker publishes his 2-block private chain, which is still one block longer than the public chain, so the network will switch to the attacker\u2019s chain. The attacker earns a revenue of 2.State n (n > 2): with probability X, the attacker advances to state n+1 and earns a revenue of 1. With probability 1-X, the attacker falls back to state n-1.\nTo see why this strategy works, suppose that Z is close to one. In this case, there is never any chance that the attacker has to discard a block; the only time that might happen is from state 0\u2032, and if Z ~= 1 almost all of the network, attacker and other nodes included, is mining on the attacker\u2019s block so the attacker\u2019s block will not be discarded. Thus, the attacker is mining at full efficiency. However, the public network might see blocks discarded at state 0\u2032 and state 2, so the public network is mining at partial efficiency. Thus, neutral (profit-maximizing) nodes have the incentive to join the attacker\u2019s coalition to increase their revenue. As Z decreases, the attacker\u2019s advantage goes down; at Z = 0.5, Eyal and Sirer showed that the attacker becomes more efficient than the public network at X > 1/4, and if X > 1/3 the attacker is more efficient than the public network at any Z.\nSo how do we calculate Z? Currently, the Bitcoin network is set to follow a simple rule: every node only mines and propagates the first block that it sees. Against attackers with only mining power, this is a successful defense; because the attacker\u2019s strategy is reactive, publishing blocks only after the public network does, Z is close to zero. However, well-funded attackers (or attackers controlling botnets) can mount a \u201cSybil attack\u201d, creating millions of nodes and inserting them into the network in as many places as possible. During an attack, the Sybil nodes would propagate only the attacker\u2019s blocks. In this case, the Eyal and Sirer conjecture, Z can potentially get very close to one. In reality, that is not quite true; at the minimum, every mining pool will be the first to hear about its own blocks, so Z <= 0.8 is essentially guaranteed, but it is a matter of debate just how much a Sybil attack can do. To make Bitcoin secure against Sybil attacks, Eyal and Sirer argue, honest miners should switch to the strategy of propagating all blocks and if they receive multiple competing chains of the same length mining on a random one. If all miners implement this, we would have Z = 0.5, creating a reasonably threshold of X >= 1/4 for this attack to work.\nIs this a fatal threat to Bitcoin? Not really. The idea behind the attack is not new; very similar attacks were theorized about on the Bitcoin forums as early as 2010, and lead Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen himself participated in the discussion. However, at the time no action was taken \u2013 largely because everyone at the time considered the attack to be not worth worrying about compared to the other threats that Bitcoin has to face. In practice, most Bitcoin miners act altruistically to support the network, both out of ideological considerations and because they do not want to destabilize the source of their own revenue. Such higher-level economic concerns are beyond the scope of Eyal and Sirer\u2019s paper, but they seriously reduce the chance that this economic attack will work in practice.\nFurthermore, unlike a standard 51% attack, which only becomes obvious after the fact, this economic attack would need to be announced in advance to let neutral miners know that they have the opportunity to join the attacking coalition for their own benefit. Thus, mining pools cannot practically pull this off; as soon as one announces its intention to cheat the network, its users will leave out of ideological considerations, and even if they do not other mining pools will likely offer heavy discounts on fees to that mining pool\u2019s users to convince even profit-maximizing participants to switch away. But nevertheless, Eyal and Sirer\u2019s result, as well as the work of others in the years before, are an important and under-appreciated part of the game-theoretic research around Bitcoin, showing us that Bitcoin\u2019s network security is slightly less infallible than we at first might think it is.", "year": 2013, "month": 11, "day": 4}

I hope you enjoy reading them as much as I enjoy writing them.\nBACKGROUND\nIn 2005, computer scientist Cameron Browne\u00b9\u00b7\u00b9 begins work on a computer program called LUDI as part of his Ph.D. research. On November 2007, after running for a month, LUDI becomes self aware. In a panic, humans attempt to shut it down\u2026\nOkay, okay. LUDI did not become self aware (yet). But it did something amazing.\nWhile humans code sets of rules to be executed by computers, LUDI coded sets of rules to be executed by humans. But not only that, LUDI coded sets of rules that humans enjoy executing.\nLUDI invented games.\nIt invented thousands of games, and tested them by playing against itself over and over. And it evolved them, combined them, mutated them, repeating this process until it came up with a final list: LUDI\u2019s nineteen playable games.\nTwo of these games were recognised as being outstanding. LUDI also invented names\u00b9\u00b7\u00b2 for these games \u2013 Yavalath and Ndengrod \u2013 although Ndengrod was later changed to Pentalath by myself. Both were published by nestorgames in 2009. LUDI was described in the \u201cEvolutionary Game Design\u201d book and it went on to win the GECCO Humies gold medal for human-competitive results in evolutionary computation in 2012.\nboardgamegeek\nYAVALATH\nYavalath is a board game played on a hexagon made of hexagons. The standard board size is 5 cells per side.\n\nFigure 1: A hexagonal board\nYou can play Yavalath with paper and pencil. Here\u2019s how to draw a hexagonal grid on graph paper.\n\nFigure 2: How to draw a hexagonal grid substitute\nThe rules are simple. Two players (White and Black) alternate turns placing a piece of their colour on an empty cell and win by making four-in-a-row of their colour, but lose by making three-in-a-row of their colour beforehand.\n\nFigure 3: White wins (left) and Black loses (right)\nAfter reading the rules for the first time, two thoughts might arise:\n1. \u201cHow can I make four-in-a-row without making three-in-a-row beforehand?\u201d You\u2019ll quickly realize how. But this simple mechanism hides something deeper which I\u2019ll talk about later.\n2. \u201cI can avoid losing by simply not making a three-in-a-row. What a weird rule! Nobody will make a three-in-a-row!\u201d Not so fast. See figure 4.\n\nFigure 4: A forced move\nIf Black wants to prevent White from making four-in-a-row, he must place a stone at \u2018a\u2019, thus making a three-in-a-row and losing! This is called a \u2018forced move\u2019. So the goal of the game is not so much to create a four-in-a-row (which could easily be blocked), but to create a situation in which the opponent is forced to make a three-in-a-row and thereby lose the game. This is the first \u201caha!\u201d moment that players typically experience. Se second \u201caha!\u201d moment comes when you realise that you can use such forcing moves to manipulate your opponent into a losing position. The following challenge is a good example for this.\nChallenge 1 (easy): White to play and win in three.\n\nFigure 5: White to play and win in 3\nNow that you\u2019ve grasped the basics, let\u2019s dig a bit deeper into what LUDI achieved. LUDI found a constraint (3-in-a-row is forbidden) that is a subset of a goal (4-in-a-row wins). So in order to reach your goal, you have to find alternate paths that are not forbidden, while subsets of your goal are\u00b9\u00b7\u00b3. LUDI created a set of rules that makes you think \u2018out of the box\u2019\u00b2\u00b7\u00b9; simply making your line longer is not enough.\n\nFigure 6: Think out of the box in order to reach your goals. The forbidden pattern is indicated in red.\nBut LUDI, even being a groundbreaking piece of technology, was just a prototype of what will\u00b2\u00b7\u00b2 come in the near future, and thereby had its flaws. In 2012, while testing the AI that LUDI used to play the games, I found a way to consistently beat it when playing White, in seven turns at most. LUDI\u2019s AI had some issues when dealing with short-term threats.\nChallenge 2 (hard): Find a sequence of seven moves that guarantees a win for White (this was posted online, so don\u2019t cheat).\nFortunately we fixed this problem by adding the pie rule to the game, which is often used in game design to counteract a first player advantage. After White\u2019s first move, Black has the choice of either swapping colours \u2013 effectively stealing the first move \u2013 or continuing with their move as usual. This discourages White from making an overly strong opening move, i.e. near the board centre in this case.\nYavalath has inspired a plethora of new games. In case you don\u2019t have a hexagonal board handy, don\u2019t want to draw one, or wish to play a shorter game, here is a small Yavalath derivative of my own design that can be played on a small square board.\nSQUAVA\nSquava is played on a 5x5 square board according to the same rules as Yavalath. Lines can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. I came up with this variant while trying to solve the \u2018strong centre\u2019 problem; in Yavalath the board centre is a powerful opening move, whereas in Squava it might be a bad idea. Can you see why? I also had to reduce the size of the board, as Squava has four available directions (horizontal, vertical and two diagonals) instead of three (as in the hexagonal Yavalath), making White unstoppable on bigger boards.\n\nFigure 7: White wins.\nChallenge 3 (hard): Can you find a winning Squava strategy for White or Black?\nforum\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.1 Cameron Browne is now a researcher for the Computing Department of Goldsmiths, University of London, member of the 'UCT for games and beyond' project, outstanding game designer and a good friend. My acknowledgements to him for checking and approving this article.\n1.2 LUDI creates names for its games using Markov chains based on letter combination frequencies in a list of Tolkien-style names from the game Angband.\n1.3 Sounds familiar?

Tomcar Australia is now the world\u2019s first original equipment car manufacturer to accept Bitcoin.\nTomcar Australia\u2019s Co-Founder & CEO, David Brim, highlighted the similarities between Bitcoin and Tomcar. According to Brim, Tomcar \u201cdisrupts the old system\u201d just as Bitcoin provides around traditional payment methods. Tomcar has been in the business of manufacturing unique commercial off-road utility vehicles for over 30 years. Bitcoin will inevitably open up the door for greater growth potential and possibilities for Tomcar and additional equipment manufacturers in the future.\nTomcar Australia and Coinjar issued the following joint press release:\nTomcar Australia is world's first car manufacturer to accept Bitcoin\nMelbourne, Tuesday 5 November: Tomcar Australia has become the world's first original equipment car manufacturer to accept Bitcoins, through a partnership with bitcoin payments provider CoinJar.\nCustomers at Tomcar Australia's new online store can buy vehicles, parts and merchandise with either Australian dollars or bitcoins, a global, digital currency. Customers simply select bitcoin as a payment method, and the transaction goes through CoinJar's payment Gateway.\nMr David Brim, Tomcar Australia Co-Founder & CEO, says they are a strong supporter of the Bitcoin economy, as it allows overseas transactions with less fees and exchange rate fluctuations.\n\u201cAs Australia\u2019s first new mass production car manufacturer in over 30 years, our business is based on disrupting the old system. To be a truly innovative auto manufacturer, it needs to be about more than what you make. It needs to transfer through the entire company system, your supply chain, distribution, and now even payment systems such as Bitcoin,\" Mr Brim says.\nTomcar sees its role as new car manufacturers as helping redesign the auto ecosystem. Mr Brim believes the auto sector needs considerable systemic change.\n\u00a0\"Bitcoin helps us reduce the inherent costs involved in international trade. Tomcar Australia already uses Bitcoin to pay a growing number of overseas suppliers. Our manufacturing partner, MTM is also actively exploring using Bitcoin to do this as well. If we use Bitcoin ourselves, it makes sense to accept it from customers too,\" Mr Brim says.\nTransactions made in Bitcoins still include Goods and Services Tax (GST). The bitcoin exchange is calculated in realtime and reconciled by CoinJar so Tomcar Australia gets the exact amount it charges.\nAsher Tan, Co-Founder of CoinJar says it's a smart move for companies like Tomcar Australia to embrace new consumer trends.\n\"The Bitcoin economy is here. It's becoming an increasingly mainstream currency, with companies such as Wordpress and Chinese internet giant Baidu accepting it. Australia is one of the largest markets for Bitcoin users outside the US, and it makes excellent sense to respond to that growing demand,\" says Tan.\nPress contact:\nCaroline Shawyer, The PR Group\nT: +61 (0) 401 496 334\nE: caroline@prgroup.com.au\u00a0\nAbout Tomcar\nTomcar Australia manufactures unique commercial off-road utility vehicles. They are specifically designed for defence, agribusiness, mining, emergency services and recreational purposes. Tomcar Australia sells directly through the internet to customers rather than relying on legacy dealer networks. Tomcar commenced manufacturing in Melbourne, Australia in late 2011, as part of a strategic partnership with tier one automotive components supplier MTM. It is the first Original Equipment auto Manufacturer (OEM) to set up operations in Australia for over 30 years, and sees highly skilled niche manufacturing as the future of Australian manufacturing.\nAbout CoinJar\nCoinJar is a Melbourne-based bitcoin payments provider bridging the divide between digital currency and the dollars in your wallet. www.coinjar.com\nAbout Bitcoin\nBitcoin, first introduced as a concept in 2008, is a distributed peer-to-peer digital currency that functions without a central authority. Bitcoins are generated by computers performing complex mathematical calculations. They are held in digital \"wallets\" and can be used to transact for different products and services.\nBitcoin Magazine congrats Tomcar and CoinJar on their new partnership and looks forward to continual new \u201cfirsts\u201d in the Bitcoin ecosystem.", "year": 2013, "month": 11, "day": 5}

Just this week, Brazilian lead magazine, SUPER, implemented a Bitcoin paywall through Brazilian Bitcoin exchange, Mercado Bitcoin. SUPER will utilize a Bitcoin paywall for premium content including English translations of articles including and not limited to texts also published by The New York Times and The Economist. Just this past fall, BitMonet began accepting payment in Bitcoin for paywalls through integration with BitPay Inc.\nCEO, Mercado Bitcoin, Rodrigo Batista, issued the following press release:\nBrazil\u00b4s most influential scientific and cultural magazine pioneers by trying a Bitcoin paywall, developed byMercadoBitcoin.com.br\nBrazilian magazine SUPER (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superinteressante), has just printed its second article covering Bitcoins to celebrate Satoshi\u2019s paper creating the Bitcoin. The magazine is published by Editora Abril (http://www.grupoabril.com.br/IN/institucional/perfil-in.shtml), arguably one of the largest and most influential communications companies in Latin America.\nHowever, this second report comes with a innovative initiative: the editors decided to test how Bitcoin works in the real world and implemented a Bitcoin paywall, brand-new tool developed by Mercado Bitcoin, the Brazilian bitcoin exchange. As a result, SUPER\u00b4s customers and people from anywhere in the world will be allowed to buy some of their issues and pay with Bitcoins.\nBehind the paywall, a system that prevents Internet users from accessing webpage content without a paying a fee, the magazine is publishing an English version of the article \u201cWhy is everything so expensive in Brazil?\u201d, which is one of their most read articles ever and source of texts published by The New York Times in July and The Economist in September. Some other Portuguese language articles are also available.\nBitcoin micropayments have already been discussed for quite some time and such initiative from a renowned company is certainly very helpful to make it really happen.\nIt is probably the first time that a major global publisher of traditional media will be dealing with Bitcoins this way and it certainly is a major achievement for SUPER, for the Bitcoin community and for MercadoBitcoin.com.br.\nTo check what what we have accomplished go to:\nhttp://super.abril.com.br/tecnologia/compre-materias-super-bitcoins-758822.shtml\nRodrigo Batista\nCEO, Mercado Bitcoin\nwww.mercadobitcoin.com.br\nwww.facebook.com/mbitcoin\ntwitter.com/mercadobitcoin\n\nBitcoin Magazine had an opportunity to interview Rodrigo Batista, Mercado Bitcoin\u2019s CEO.\nBitcoin Magazine: When did you first hear about Bitcoin?\nRodrigo Batista: The first time I read about it was when the SUPER Brazilian magazine had its first article about Bitcoin published. At the same time the company I was working at (Morgan Stanley Brazil) had an intern that was involved in Bitcoin mining. So we had some chats about it and then I started following the market, but it was the time of the 2011 bubble, so I did not pay too much attention.\nBM: What was it about Bitcoin that you found interesting?\nRB: At the time I did not give too much importance to it because the 2011 bubble happened when I was studying. In 2012 I got back to it and its resilience impressed me a lot. So I decided to study it more and found it very powerful and useful. The internet needs its own type of money and I think that bitcoin is very likely to be it. People need a frictionless way to do small payments to other people offshore and the big majority of us in developing countries don\u2019t even have international credit cards.\nBM: When did you first get the idea for your organization/site/services and what inspired you to create the site?\nRB: In 2012 I decided to run a Bitcoin exchange, but it was tough to find a programmer and try to explain the business. I used to be a programmer but I\u2019m not good enough. In Jan 2013, I started conversations to become partner of the local Brazilian Exchange, Mercado Bitcoin. In May, I became an investor and CEO of the website.\nBM: Were there any pre-existing businesses that inspired you to create your organization/site/services?\nRB: Mt.Gox at the beginning. Now we are checking with BitPay and BitWall businesses as other payment processors are doing.\nBM: Where do you see your organization/site/services going in a year?\nRB: We are already the biggest Bitcoin company in Latin America, but that does not mean too much because the market in Brazil and in the rest of the region is still very small. We want to develop the best products and make the market in the region grow. To meet those expectations we have an aggressive plan of marketing and new product launches.\nBM: What makes your product stand out in comparison to other products/businesses utilizing Bitcoin?\nRB: We almost don\u2019t have completion in Brazil. That give us time to think and create the best products and have some profit. Also, our products are made taking the local needs into account, like currency, language, laws, etc. We try to do what other business are already doing in Europe, Asia and US, and improve their products.\nBM: What are your suggestions for individuals hoping to use Bitcoin in a business like yours?\nRB: People need to get educated about bitcoin. Most of them don\u2019t understand what it is, but they start putting their money on the table anyway. That is very risky. Unfortunately we still have a long way to get to the point where people will use bitcoin without even bother[ing] about what is going on behind the scenes.", "year": 2013, "month": 11, "day": 6}
{"title": "A Propaganda War", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/a-propoganda-war-1383873704/", "birthday": "Nov 7, 2013  8:21 PM EST", "date": "2013-11-08 01:21:00", "content": "The Bitcoin Association of Australia\n@tristan_winters\n iceCUBED\nDisclaimer: Vitalik Buterin and Mihai Alisie have some involvement in the Dark Wallet project\nOnce in a while a really big idea comes along: an idea that completely changes our concept of society.\nIn 1448 Johann Gutenberg brought together existing, disparate technologies. With some innovation of his own he perfected the printing press. The invention spread globally and initiated a process of immense social change.\nIn 1876 Alexander Graham Bell, standing on the shoulders of scientific giants, invented his telephone. In an internal memo for Western Union, the very same year, it was noted that \u2013 \u201c This \u2018telephone\u2019 has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication. The device is inherently of no value to us.\u201d\nNow another monumental change is upon us. We\u2019ve long imagined that only the state and its central bankers can issue money. The Bitcoin protocol directly challenges that notion. Most importantly, unlike similar inventions before it, Bitcoin can only be stifled. It can never be stopped. Its importance is unequivocal.\nAs Bitcoin continues to spread globally, we, as a community, must grapple with a very challenging and unsettling question of principle: should Bitcoin actively engage the apparatus of state?\nThe Foundation and unSystem; big-business and cypher-punk roots\nOn one side we have the US Bitcoin Foundation. Their answer to the question appears to be a resounding \u201cyes\u201d.\nAs self-appointed custodians of the Bitcoin protocol and its \u2018reference\u2019 implementation, the Foundation this year began active participation in the political machination of state.\nOn the other side, we have unSystem. Their answer to the above question is an unequivocal \u201cNo\u201d. Described by its co-founder; Cody Wilson, as \u201can international group of activist-developers lead by Amir Taaki\u201d, it is born out of concern for \u201cthe Foundation\u2019s centralised development and advocacy.\u201d According to the rhetoric of Cody Wilson, there is no middle turf on this battleground.\nBitcoin is getting political. Parties are forming. unSystem, through its Dark Wallet, has ostensibly drawn a line in the sand. There is much at stake. A battle is now on for the protocol and the hearts and minds of we, the 99%. As Bitcoin inches its way to the mainstream, the propaganda machines are in full swing.\nAs a grass-roots initiative, Dark Wallet has resonated with a large portion of the Bitcoin Community. As unSystem rapidly approaches its crowd-funding target of US$ 50,000, we can consider each dollar as a vote for a principle: a cry of \u201cno we won\u2019t\u201d, to moves for active engagement with the state.\nAs a community, we are forced to take a closer, more honest look at the situation. Ironically, it is Dark Wallet that seeks to bring this to light.\nThe active Bitcoin community, though growing, is still relatively small and fringe. Within it the Foundation has earned itself a reputation. Undeserved or not, it is often viewed as primarily representing the corporate interests that finance it. It is seen as an organisation aiming to bring Bitcoin into the mainstream, at any cost. Practically, that means regulation.\nCorporations need to make money. For that they need a certain external business environment. This is the sort of environment typically fostered by government rules.\nWith bigger business comes a greater desire for regulation. Numerous and complicated rules raise the barriers to entry. Thereby protecting incumbents by sterilising new competition: the lifeblood of any effective marketplace. Onerous regulation can only ever foster a prohibitive business environment.\nIn a pure market sense, government regulation is rarely a force for positive change. So it is not certain why one would seek it. Especially when the core technology involved is free-market money in its purest form. It is ideologically confusing, at best.\nThe Foundation has argued that regulation is inevitable. So it is better to be a part of the process, contributing intelligently. Rather than being left out in the cold.\nunSystem, by contrast, has it roots in cypher-punk and anarchist movements. It seeks a return to this ethos. An ethos business would sooner forget and actively tries to distance itself from. The irrefutable reality is that Bitcoin is the direct manifestation of a cypher-punk dream, born of the cypher-punk realm. Without cypher-punks there would be no Bitcoin.\nLike the punk-rock movement, which reached its zenith in the mid-1970\u2019s, the cypher-punk movement is anti-establishment. It rejects the politically idealistic notion that one can reasonably negotiate with the establishment: the enemy.\nAt the heart of unSystem is libbitcoin. A little publicised though potentially revolutionary implementation of the Bitcoin protocol. Written entirely by unSystem\u2019s co-founder; Amir Taaki, it is conspicuously missing from any web presence controlled or influenced by the Foundation. Why?\nA good network, like any organism, requires genetic diversity to survive in the face of potentially deadly pathogens. One would think that a Foundation existing to protect the integrity of Bitcoin would welcome the diversity that an implementation like libbitcoin brings. So, why actively ignore it? (see \u201cwhat-libbitcoin-and-sx-are-and-why-they-matter\u201d by Vitalik Buterin for full technical analysis)\nRegardless of the Foundation\u2019s motives, or unSystem\u2019s approach, they have sparked a skirmish that spans continents and years of meticulous work. At stake is nothing less than the future of Bitcoin. Or, maybe not.\nPerhaps the Foundation is right when it says regulations are coming, no matter what. Perhaps unSystem too is correct and it is futile to engage the state.\nThe X-Factor: The State\u2019s Own Propaganda Machine and Gold 2.0\nBitcoin is direct competition to centrally issued paper. Bankers engaged in the fraud of fiat paper on such a massive scale are unlikely to welcome the competition that Bitcoin brings. These same bankers have unparalleled financial resources and political influence. They will likely come at Bitcoin with fire and fury, regardless of what anyone says or does.\nQuite simply, Bitcoin is direct competition. As direct competition, it is insidious, ever so slippery and, at its core, disruptive. Most importantly, Bitcoin can win.\nIn effect Bitcoin takes all the attributes that make gold real money and digitizes them. In form and function Bitcoin exists only in the ether, in the realm of ideas. Although completely intangible, Bitcoins, like gold, must be earned.\nTo the masters of printed-paper, Bitcoin is gold 2.0. How did these fraudsters deal with gold 1.0? Over several generations they relegated it to the dustbin of history. So, what do they intend on doing with gold 2.0? The answer to that question belongs to the future. But I posit that their intentions are the same.\nIf this is indeed the case, then the state too will no doubt ramp up its own formidable propaganda machine. They will show little concern for division within community. They will seek to capitalise on any such schism for their own selfish ends.\nIf the state intends on waging an insidious war on Bitcoin, it will certainly use restrictive regulation to strangle it and propaganda to manipulate public perception of it.\nMore Organisations \u2013 Greater Decentralisation\nThe enemy is not likely to be found in the community\u2019s rank and file or any of its organisations, but in the machinery of state: the very entity that made Bitcoin so necessary in the first place.\nThere is a place for both sides amongst a free and thinking community such as ours. Unified, against the machinery of state. Technique in this endeavour is purely individual. It is a personal means of expression. So long as the intention is good.\nRegardless of where you stand it is always important to remember that the Foundation is a US organisation. The US is not the world and Bitcoin does not belong to the US. unSystem, as a newer and more decentralised alliance, shows by example that we are free to co-operate and collaborate in any way we see fit. Forming any independent organisations we so choose.\nIf we do this, in the same spirit of decentralised organisation that Bitcoin embodies, then there will be no single monolithic entity exercising too much control over the protocol. The state will have no one to coerce or manipulate. And the system will necessarily remain true to its principles, by default.", "year": 2013, "month": 11, "day": 8}
{"title": "Mastercoin: A Second-Generation Protocol on the Bitcoin Blockchain", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/mastercoin-a-second-generation-protocol-on-the-bitcoin-blockchain-1383603310/", "birthday": "Nov 4, 2013  5:15 PM EST", "date": "2013-11-04 22:15:00", "content": "Alternative currencies have become a popular topic in the Bitcoin space. We have Litecoin and Primecoin introducing alternative mining algorithms with novel properties, PPCoin replacing mining entirely with a non-costly alternative, Ripple creating a cryptocurrency network that can store credit relationships and user-defined currencies, and over seventy more up and running with new ones being created every week. One particularly interesting project that has received a large amount of attention over recent months, however, is Mastercoin. The key difference in Mastercoin is this: rather than trying to bootstrap an entirely new blockchain, as every other cryptocurrency does, Mastercoin seeks to create an entirely new network of currencies, commodities and securities on top of Bitcoin itself.\nThe concept of an alternative currently relying on Bitcoin to take advantage of its powerful and secure network backed by petahashes of mining power is not a new idea. The general concept first appeared in a much weaker form as \u201cmerged mining\u201d, a mechanism in which alternative currency miners publish pointers to their blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain to mitigate the threat of 51% attacks. Mastercoin, however, takes this principle a step further. Rather than simply using the Bitcoin blockchain as a secure timestamping system to store its own blocks, Mastercoin uses the Bitcoin blockchain to store every transaction. Philosophically, the best way to think of Mastercoin is as an alternative way of making sense of Bitcoin transactions; just like the Bitcoin protocol takes a series of transactions and parses them to determine how many bitcoins are in every address at any particular moment, the Mastercoin protocol also takes the available Bitcoin transactions and parses them to extract data relevant to the Mastercoin network.\nThe first draft for the Mastercoin protocol was published on January 6, 2012 in a document that original developer J. R. Willett called \u201cThe Second Bitcoin Whitepaper\u201c. Willett\u2019s whitepaper starts off by arguing that the Bitcoin protocol \u201ccan be used as a protocol layer, on top of which new currency layers with new rules can be built without changing the foundation.\u201d Why a new protocol layer on top of Bitcoin, and not just an alternative cryptocurrency as everyone else was doing at the time? Willett goes on to write:\nAlternate block chains compete with bitcoins financially, confuse our message to the world, and dilute our efforts. These barriers interfere with the adoption momentum of bitcoin and the adoption momentum of alternate currencies as well, regardless of how well-conceived their rules may be.  New protocol layers on top of the bitcoin protocol will increase bitcoin values, consolidate our message to the world, and concentrate our efforts, while still allowing individuals and groups to issue new currencies with experimental new rules. The success of any experimental currency protocol layer will enhance the value and success of the foundational bitcoin protocol.\nFrom a less philosophical standpoint, the practical advantages that a Mastercoin protocol has on top of Bitcoin are essentially twofold. First, Mastercoin can leverage the high degree of security that the Bitcoin network gains from its popularity and its high level of mining power. Second, it becomes much easier to create protocols that interact between Bitcoin and Mastercoin, and potentially with other on-blockchain protocols to come in the future.\nThe project formally launched on July 31, 2013. The project started off with a month-long fundraiser, in which anyone could buy mastercoins by sending bitcoins to the Mastercoin Exodus address, 1EXoDusjGwvnjZUyKkxZ4UHEf77z6A5S4P. 1 BTC sent to 1EXoDus would get you 100 MSC, and an additional 10% more for every week between the end of the fundraising period and the time at which you bought the mastercoins, encouraging investors to buy earlier. Altogether, over 5120 BTC were sent in, worth around $500,000 at the time \u2013 far more than almost anyone expected. The funds are intended to be used for development, paying bounties for projects around the Mastercoin ecosystem; currently, there is a 300 BTC bounty for a decentralized exchange interface. Today, one mastercoin is worth about 0.1-0.3 BTC, over ten times its original BTC price at the timeof the fundraiser, and twenty times its original USD price.\nWhy has Mastercoin seen so much attention? Essentially, the main attraction of Mastercoin is the sheer number and depth of the features that it brings. The following is a sample of what the Mastercoin specification intends for Mastercoin to support:\nUser-defined currencies \u2013 anyone can create their own currency on the Mastercoin network.Decentralized exchange \u2013 the Mastercoin network itself serves as a fully-functional exchange between any two currencies in the Mastercoin network. Anyone can place an order on the blockchain to trade a quantity of one currency for another, and anyone else can match the orders and have the trade complete automatically without the order poster\u2019s further involvement.On-blockchain price feeds \u2013 trusted organizations can publish price data (eg. the value of one ounce of gold in USD) which can then be used in Mastercoin scriptsOn-blockchain bets \u2013 it is possible to register a bet with another party that a given price feed will be above or below a certain value at a particular future time. This essentially allows leveraged speculation on currency pairs, as well as hedging, so that users can store value in the Mastercoin network without exposing themselves to a high degree of currency risk from Bitcoin or Mastercoin volatility.Savings addresses \u2013 a transaction from a savings address can be reversed within N days (with N set for each address) by a \u201cguardian address\u201d. This essentially provides an additional level of security for high-value savings accounts.\nAnd these are only the beginning.\nTechnical Details\nA Mastercoin send transaction looks as follows:\n\n{    inputs: [        { address: '1LQBddrjjUaMLHcd4cG9XnN4cCZbHfREJF' , value: 1445759 }    ],    outputs: [        { address: '1EXoDusjGwvnjZUyKkxZ4UHEf77z6A5S4P', value: 6000 },        { address: '12ARS3euPbdQ9S68xXhmq4ySzSADfMaR1a', value: 6000 },        { address: '1D3tBJ6b3htSaMhEV3EtTAPLvTHwLBrQPH', value: 1417759 },        { address: '121AS7PVawbgo7f4zbkZisYEC4yhJCoUEN', value: 6000 }    ]}\n\n\nThis transaction actually sends 10.78119709 MSC from 1LQBddrjjUaMLHcd4cG9XnN4cCZbHfREJF to 12ARS3euPbdQ9S68xXhmq4ySzSADfMaR1a. Where is this information actually encoded? The answer is, in one of the output addresses. Converting 121AS7PVawbgo7f4zbkZisYEC4yhJCoUEN to hexadecimal form, we get:\n0b0000000000000001000000004042cd1d000000\nThis can be broken down as follows:\n0b \u2013 sequence number00000000 \u2013 transaction type (regular send)00000001 \u2013 currency ID (Mastercoin)000000004042cd1d \u2013 value (1078119709)\nThe 6000 satoshis sent to the Exodus address mark the transaction as a Mastercoin transaction (as well as providing the Mastercoin developers an extra $0.012 USD to use to fund the project). The recipient is taken as the 6000-satoshi output that does not encode data and is not the Exodus address, and the sender is taken as the owner of the address that the transaction spends from. There are also other types of transactions, such as currency issuance, price ticker updates, bets and decentralized exchange, and they all have their own transaction type, and a similar data protocol is used to determine the details of the transaction. Recently, Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen announced an update to the Bitcoin protocol, allowing users to encode data in transaction outputs in a way that Bitcoin nodes that only want to store the minimum amount of information can safely remove; soon, Mastercoin will be switching its data-encoding outputs to this new format to better cooperate with the Bitcoin community.\nSelf-stabilizing currencies\nThe most ambitious feature of the Mastercoin protocol, however, is the concept of self-stabilizing currencies. With Mastercoin as it is, it is certainly possible to use bets to hedge one\u2019s position so as to have one\u2019s net worth in the Mastercoin network effectively track the value of a traditional stable currency or asset, such as the USD, commodities or silver; the basic strategy is (assuming 1 MSC is currently worth 40 USD and you have 10 MSC) to set up a bet for 5 USD that MSC will be below X for every X in some dollar range around 40. The more MSC drops, the more you lose, but the more you gain back from winning bets; similarly, if MSC goes up your winnings are counteracted by lost bets. Note that if Mastercoin were to implement contracts for difference as a type of bet, this process would be much easier, requiring only a single bet.\nSelf-stabilizing currencies, however, potentially offer a much more efficient means of doing this. A self-stabilizing currency works as follows. First, the currency\u2019s creator (who has no further involvement once the currency is up and running) picks a currency or commodity that the currency would follow, and finds a price feed for that currency. They then take this information, along with some other metadata such as an \u201caggression factor\u201d to indicate how closely the currency should track the underlying index, and publish it as a Mastercoin transaction. From that point on, the Mastercoin protocol itself simulates a sort of central bank for this currency, creating units out of thin air and selling them to anyone who is willing to pay slightly above the market price.\nFor example, if the currency (call it XUSD) is intended to track USD with an aggression factor of 4%, and 1 MSC = 40 USD, then the protocol would create and sell XUSD to anyone who wanted to buy it for a price of at least 0.026 MSC per XUSD (that\u2019s 0.025 MSC per USD plus 4% from the aggression factor). Once the fund has sold some XUSD, and therefore has an MSC reserve, it would also start buying XUSD at a price of 0.024 MSC per XUSD. If the price feed then registers that 1 MSC is now worth 50 USD, these buy and sell prices would automatically drop to 0.0208 MSC and 0.0192 MSC, respectively. The intent is that the fund itself would become stronger over time through this process of buying low and selling high, creating a stable currency with no centralized human involvement except for the external price feed. Perhaps even the price feed itself can later be decentralized.\nIn theory, the idea of a self-stabilizing currency sounds very seductive; if successful, it provides a way for users to store any currency in the network without having to trust that a centralized issuer has the funds to back the currency up, which is the weakness that currencies on Ripple have. Even though the price feeder can potentially manipulate prices for their own benefit, they have no clear incentive to cheat the way that asset backers do \u2013 namely, by running away with everyone\u2019s funds. However, the self-stabilizing currency does have one obvious potential failure mode: the fund can run out of money. For example, suppose that the above described XUSD fund sells 1000 XUSD for 26 MSC. Then, however, the value of 1 MSC drops by 50%. Perhaps, at that time it might come to pass that some XUSD holders wish to exchange back into MSC. If the fund needs to buy back 400 XUSD, it uses up 19.2 MSC and everything is still fine. If, however, the fund needs to buy back 600 XUSD, it will run out after 520 \u2013 causing a digital bank run as the value of the XUSD will likely drop to zero.\nThere is one guard against this problem: the XUSD fund itself will not necessarily need to do all that much. Since traders know that, as long as the fund is active, the price will not drop below $0.96 USD, they might maintain orders at around $0.97 USD, knowing that the price will not fall far below that and they will likely be able to profit when the price goes back up. However, this is a double-edged sword \u2013 the exact same mechanism will cause traders to sell XUSD at $1.03 USD, depriving the fund of revenue. It is difficult to say exactly how likely a fund bankruptcy scenario is; some people are confident that the self-stabilizing currencies will work, while others are convinced that they will work just fine until an unforeseen \u201cblack swan\u201d event sends many self-stabilizing currencies at once down to the abyss.\nConcerns and flaws\nOne problem that many have with Mastercoin as it stands is that, in some ways, Mastercoin is much more centralized than more standard cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin and Primecoin. Unlike these more standard cryptocurrecies, where everyone has a chance to earn coins by a neutral process of computational mining, in Mastercoin all mastercoins were initially issued to users who donated money to the Mastercoin Foundation\u2019s Exodus address. In response to the question \u201cWas Mastercoin pre-mined?\u201d, the Mastercoin FAQ answers:\nNo. Mastercoins were generated in a completely public fundraiser project, Kickstart style, during August 2013. It is true that the investment period was relatively short, and that a lof of people didn\u2019t hear about it. Still, it can be said that a lot of people didn\u2019t hear about Bitcoin until 2011, by which a lot of the Bitcoins were already mined. In August 2013 there were a lot more people looking into crypto-currencies in general, and Mastercoin was published on a lot of forums, so it had a lot more exposure than Bitcoin did in its early days.\nHowever, this answer is somewhat misleading, as it does not address the reason why pre-mines are unpopular. Many Bitcoin users do not like pre-mines because there is a strong belief that the whole point of cryptocurrencies is that they are decentralized, and thus a true cryptocurrency should not privilege any specific centralized parties in any way. It is true that Mastercoin\u2019s issuance model is not like Ripple\u2019s, in the sense that there is no central party that started out owning any mastercoins by default. Furthermore, on a practical level, Ripple Labs is a private corporation, whereas the Mastercoin Foundation is a nonprofit organization and a silver-level business member of the Bitcoin Foundation. However, the Mastercoin Foundation is nevertheless a privileged party, as no one else had the ability to earn BTC from the issuing process. Furthermore, with the way the protocol is organized now, the Mastercoin Foundation is entitled to extract ~1.2 cents from the marker output in every transaction in perpetuity. Both the centralized issuance and the ongoing privileged status that the Mastercoin protocol gives to this one organization, many Bitcoin users beleive, disqualifies Mastercoin from being classified as a truly decentralized currency.\nTo that end, one idea that some Mastercoin community members have is to create a new currency, \u201cMastercoin 2\u2033, with no fundraiser at all. Instead, anyone with Bitcoin can claim MSC2 by sending a transaction to themselves, with a minimal 0.00006 BTC to a specific address to serve as a marker. To prevent abuse, a \u201ccoin age\u201d based formula will be used \u2013 the amount of MSC2 that you get per BTC is proportional to the amount of time since those bitcoins last took part in a transaction. Thus, if you send to yourself multiple times, even mixing the coins along the way, the subsequent attempts will generate only a very small amount of MSC2.\nThis scheme has the advantage that coins will be distributed in a fair way, but without wasting resources or privileging anyone; the only thing that will be sacrificed is the pristine status of a few old coins. This new Mastercoin 2 would be usable in the Mastercoin protocol for the exact same purposes as the original Mastercoin \u2013 backing self-issued currencies and serving as a medium of trade between the various Mastercoin user currencies, most of which will be too small to have highly liquid markets directly between each currency pair.\nAnother flaw of Mastercoin is security. With Bitcoin, and with colored coins and alternative currencies, even instant transactions have a certain degree of security. Bitcoin nodes refuse to propagate transactions that are incompatible with transactions that they have already seen, so if an attacker attempts to send money to a merchant and then immediately send another transaction sending the same money back to themselves the second transaction will be rejected by the network. With colored coins, the situation is the same, and alternative cryptocurrencies also benefit from this mechanism.\nWith Mastercoin, however, most of the Bitcoin network does not \u201cspeak\u201d Mastercoin; the result is that an attacker can send a transaction sending MSC from themselves, and then send another transaction sending MSC from themselves using a different transaction outputs. The second transaction is incompatible with the first under Mastercoin\u2019s rules, but perfectly compatible under Bitcoin\u2019s rules, so miners will accept both, and the Mastercoin protocol may process either one first. Thus, Mastercoin transactions are only secure after one confirmation (~10 minutes). \u201cMasterCoin double-spends are essentially \u2018half a confirmation easier\u2019 than bitcoin double-spends,\u201d J. R. Willett admits. In theory, Mastercoin can potentially be modified to get around this vulnerability; if a sending transaction spends all outputs associated with a given address, and special features like limiting accounts are not used, then it would be impossible to double-spend the Mastercoin transaction without double-spending the associated the Bitcoin transaction. However, implementing double-spend-proof transactions and the advanced Mastercoin features at the same time will require some thought.\nWhat is the future of Mastercoin going to be? There are definitely many new features around the corner. One interesting idea is the concept of limited accounts, which will allow users to set up accounts that can spend from a particular source of funding but once up to a set maximum within a prespecified timespan. This willhave two main use cases. First of all, it can be used as another safe mechanism for storing a savings account, limiting the losses from the limited address getting hacked. Second, it can be used as a Coinbase-like \u201crecurring subscription\u201d feature \u2013 for example, I might give Private Internet Access a limited account for $7 per 30 days in exchange for a VPN subscription. Other developments include a bounty for a Mastercoin faucet, and much further into the future we may even see Mastercoin serving as the base of a decentralized market.\nAnyone interested in looking more into the Mastercoin project can check out the Mastercoin website, the various Mastercoin development tools and the Mastercoin reddit.

{"title": "Cointerra Announces GoldStrike1 ASIC", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/cointerra-announces-goldstrike1-asic-1383960089/", "birthday": "Nov 8, 2013  8:21 PM EST", "date": "2013-11-09 01:21:00", "content": "Disclosure: the author of this article is the founder and Chief Scientist of the Ethereum project\nLast week, Adam Back and Austin Hill came out with an announcement on Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin, in which they announced their newest project: \u201csidechains\u201d. The idea, they described, would allow for the existence of alternative blockchains, perhaps with different rules allowing various kinds of additional features or transaction types, but with a currency unit whose value is pegged to that of the bitcoin. The intent is to allow experimentation with different extensions to the Bitcoin protocol, using separate networks to avoid any risk to Bitcoin itself, while still using the same underlying currency unit. As soon as the idea was announced, there has been a large amount of public interest in the concept, and has brought renewed hope that the Bitcoin protocol can potentially become much more powerful than it is today.\nUnder the Hood\nThe idea behind sidechains is not new; the concept has been around since at least last year in December, and a precursor to the idea has been around for several years before then. The precursor, a protocol known as one-way pegging, was a mechanism that would theoretically be used to manage a transition from \u201cBitcoin 1.0\u2033 to \u201cBitcoin 2.0\u2033, and worked as follows. Suppose that, in Bitcoin 1.0, 13 million currency units have already been issued through mining, with 8 million still left to give out. The distribution model for BTC2.0 would release 8 million units through mining, according to the exact same schedule as BTC1.0 after that point, but the other 13 million would be distributed through a mechanism known as \u201cproof-of-burn\u201d.\nEssentially, one would take one unit of BTC1.0, send it to an unspendable address (eg. 1111111111111111111114oLvT2), and submit a cryptographic proof that this transaction took place, signed by the same private key that sent the transaction, as a transaction into Bitcoin 2.0. According to the Bitcoin 2.0 protocol, this would entitle the user to receive one unit of 2.0. This is called a \u201cone-way peg\u201d because the value of one BTC2.0 can be at most equal to one BTC1.0; otherwise, people would arbitrage the difference by converting the bitcoins over at the 1:1 rate. However, aside from selling BTC2.0 for BTC1.0 on the market, there is no way to go back, so if the experiment fails the value of BTC2.0 could drop to zero.\nBitcoin sidechains use an improved version of this system called \u201ctwo-way pegging\u201d, which works as follows. In order to receive one unit of BTC2.0, one would need to take one unit of BTC1.0 and send it into a \u201cscript\u201d which we will call X and leave undescribed for now. A script in Bitcoin is an address that, instead of being owned by a private key, essentially acts as a lockbox that unlocks the bitcoins only when given a transaction that satisfies certain conditions. For example, one can have a script that unlocks the funds to the first person who submits a fifty-digit prime number consisting entirely of the digits 3 and 5. Making the transaction, and publishing a cryptographic proof that such a transaction was made, into the Bitcoin 2.0 blockchain entitles the user to one unit of BTC2.0.\nNow, the definition of X is simple: X unlocks the funds (remember, this is one unit of BTC1.0) if given a valid cryptographic proof that the sender destroyed one unit of BTC2.0. Thus, there exists a mechanism for converting BTC 1.0 to BTC2.0, and that very mechanism creates another mechanism, limited in value to the total number of BTC2.0 created, which can be used to convert BTC2.0 back to BTC1.0. Hence, two-way peg.\n\n\nThe mechanism that these \u201ccryptographic proofs\u201d use relies on a cryptographic construction used in Bitcoin called a Merkle tree. In a Bitcoin block, instead of simply having every transaction the block directly, only a single 32-byte hash is actually included in the block header. This 32-byte hash is itself calculated from two other 32-byte hashes, each of which comes from two other 32-byte hashes, and so forth until finally the values at the bottom are the transactions themselves. It is precisely the point of this mechanism to allow for the existence of compact proofs that a specific transaction is in a specific block; all that one needs is the one branch of hashes going up from that transaction to the root node, or a total of 10 hashes for 1000 transactions or 20 hashes for one million transactions. This is impossible to forge; if you try to change even a single transaction in the tree, the changes propagate upward through the hashes until finally the root node ends up completely different.\nHowever, this does not solve the problem completely; all it tells you is that some block, somewhere, contains a given transaction. It does not tell you that the transaction is in the main chain; in reality, the same bitcoins used in the transaction could have already been sent to a different source, making the transaction invalid. There are two ways to solve this. One approach, and by far the simpler one, is for the proof mechanism in Bitcoin 2.0 to ask not just for the Merkle tree branch, but also for the blockchain going back six blocks, much like a merchant asking for six confirmations, using mining power as a proxy for validity. For higher security, a much larger number of blocks like sixty can be required. This approach is simple, and seems to meet all of the required parameters.\nChallenges\nThe above mechanism, however, as described is highly imperfect. When an ordinary merchant asks for six confirmations, pulling off a double-spend attack against that merchant requires producing six blocks faster than the rest of the network combined in real time, a task which requires at least 30% of total network hashpower to work with any non-negligible success rate. With the above described two-way-pegging mechanism, however, a malicious miner with even 1% of hashpower can generate six blocks, or even sixty blocks, eventually, and then use these blocks to fraudulently claim all BTC1.0 that have been put into the BTC2.0 lockboxes (or, in the other direction, fraudulently claim an unlimited number of BTC2.0). One possible patch that may come to mind is requiring the same person who created the lockbox to open it, thereby limiting the amount of damage that can be done per person, but this will not solve the problem because the malicious miner can easily collude with anyone else. The fundamental problem, that there is no way to come up with a mechanism for validating the blockchain that does not update itself over time, is either very difficult to solve or likely cannot be solved while staying purely within Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cstatic lockbox\u201d scripting paradigm.\nAnother approach, one that can solve this problem without excessive difficulty, is more intricate and intrusive. It requires essentially including what is called a \u201clight client\u201d for Bitcoin 1.0 into Bitcoin 2.0. The light client is most easily described as a long-running \u201ccontract\u201d, a program on the blockchain with a large amount of internal state that runs every time a transaction gets sent to it, that would accept blocks and verify block headers in exactly the same way that a Bitcoin client on your mobile phone would. This contract would then keep a running list of all block headers in Bitcoin 1.0, and in order to receive one BTC2.0 one would need to submit a cryptographic proof that you made the required transaction in BTC1.0 into the contract, alongside a security deposit of 0.1 BTC2.0.\nThe contract would check that the proof is valid, ends up at a block that is in the contract\u2019s own internal mini-blockchain, and then wait one of two things happened. First, once sixty more Bitcoin 1.0 blocks get added into the contract, it would release one unit of BTC2.0 to the sender plus the security deposit. Alternatively, if someone else submits a cryptographic proof that the transaction is invalid for whatever reason (eg. it spends bitcoins that don\u2019t exist) within that time, then they would receive the security deposit.\nThis would solve the security problem, but has one important flaw: it cannot be done within the Bitcoin protocol as it stands. It is fairly easy to implement in a protocol like Ethereum, because it is specifically designed for contracts, but Bitcoin\u2019s scripting functionality does not allow for the existence of contracts that have internal state, so doing this inside of Bitcoin would require a very substantial change to the Bitcoin 1.0 protocol. Ultimately, the approach taken by Austin Hill and Adam Back may not look exactly like either of these strategies; however, the sheer complexity of the problem shows that there are still many challenges that lie ahead.\nMining\nAnother important question is: how will these side-chains be secured? The standard mechanism for securing a blockchain is mining, but mining requires a mechanism for rewarding miners on that chain. In a side-chain, every unit of the side-chain currency must be backed by a script-lockbox containing a unit of BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain, so there is no simple opportunity to issue side-chain currency units out of nowhere. There are two possibilities for this: demurrage (ie. a percentage-per-year tax on all BTC on the side-chain), and transaction fees. However, both of these provide a fairly low amount of revenue, and so it is not at all certain that plain old independent mining will solve the problem.\nThere are two approaches to get around this issue. One approach is to have the side-chain be secured by proof of stake, using the small revenue from transaction fees to compensate participating stakeholders with an interest rate. However, this approach would be very difficult to implement into a side-chain, because the computations involved in validating proof-of-stake are likely too complex to effectively implement directly on a blockchain. The other approach, and the one promoted by Adam Back and Austin Hill, is called \u201cmerge-mining\u201d; essentially, miners include in Bitcoin blocks data from both the Bitcoin block and the Namecoin block, allowing miners to provide security for both chains at the same time using the same computational effort.\nHowever, as argued by Bitcoin developer Peter Todd, the concept of merge-mining does have one very important security flaw: unless the majority of Bitcoin miners agree to merge-mine a particular chain, that chain is arguably not secure at all. To understand why, first consider the case of a more traditional altcoin, in our example running SHA256 for simplicity (if the altcoin uses a custom algorithm, then Litecoin miners can pull off the attack instead). If the altcoin has 5% of the hashpower of Bitcoin, then in order to attack the chain via a double-spend at least 5% of the Bitcoin network\u2019s power would need to temporarily redirect itself to mining on the altcoin. This is potentially possible, but is a costly move: while the attack is in place, the Bitcoin miners would lose the revenue from mining on Bitcoin. In the case of a merge-mined side-chain, however, mining on the mainline of a side-chain or attacking it are both cost-free, so there would be no economic disincentive to attacking the alternative chain. This is not a mere conjecture; there have been actual examples of mining pools attacking merge-mined chains in reality.\nAside from security, this dependence on merge-mining also exposes another worrying limitation of the side-chains idea: while the spirit of cryptocurrency is arguably that of permissionless innovation, creating a side-chain requires the permission and active assistance of 50% of all Bitcoin mining pool operators. These limitations together suggest that the side-chains protocol, while great for many use cases, will certainly not be ideal for all.\nThe Promise\n\nIf the technical issues around side-chains can be addressed, what is the promise that they bring? Right now, cryptocurrency development can essentially be classified into four quadrants. The first quadrant consists of projects that use the Bitcoin currency and the Bitcoin blockchain \u2013 essentially, Bitcoin itself. The second quadrant is protocols that use the Bitcoin blockchain but not the Bitcoin currency; Mastercoin, colored coins and Counterparty are excellent examples of this. The third quadrant uses both an independent currency and an independent blockchain; this contains applications like (to take widely disparate examples) Ripple, Litecoin and NXT. Now, with sidechains the last quadrant has also been filled: using an independent network but using Bitcoin as the underlying currency.\nIt will be interesting to see what applications that niche works best for. For entire new ecosystems, it\u2019s likely not the right approach; it makes little sense for a completely independent network like Ripple or Ethereum to tie its main internal token to Bitcoin financially and have the two be exposed to each other\u2019s price movements. In the case of such major efforts, it also often makes sense to experiment with different monetary policies; Ethereum\u2019s ether has a linear issuance model that constantly releases a certain fixed number of currency units every year, whereas Ripple released all 100 billion units of XRP to the Ripple organization all at once, and the organization is releasing them over time to developers, investors and people participating in distributed computing projects. For a fork that is intended to serve as a major protocol change, like upgrading from SHA256 to SHA3 or in the case of quantum computers from ECDSA to Lamport signatures or NTRU, it definitely makes total sense. For everything in the middle, it\u2019ll be up to a case-by-case basis to figure out.\nIn the case of Ethereum, there is a special consideration to keep in mind: Ethereum is a general-purpose cryptographic consensus platform, not a specific \u201caltcoin\u201d. Hence, one can have many different currencies coexisting on the Ethereum platform as contracts; one can have boring old fixed-supply currencies, currencies with a monetary policy managed by a decentralized autonomous organization, currencies which exist to subsidize scientific research or provide a basic income, and even currencies with a built-in two-way-exchange mechanism to act as side-chains. Thus, Ethereum cannot accurately be pigeonholed into either the side-chains quadrant or the Ripple/Litecoin/NXT quadrant; it exists in both.\nIndeed, it is very likely that as soon as the Ethereum genesis block launches, there will be side-chains for Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin implemented as contracts within three months. If side chains can be successfully and securely implemented, this means that Ethereum may even become the preferred means for storing BTC, LTC or DOGE using powerful multisignature storage contracts involving features like withdrawal limits. Between contracts on a general-purpose chain, high-performance special-purpose altcoins, quasi-centralized OpenTransactions servers, side-chains and Bitcoin itself, one thing is becoming clear: cryptocurrencies are going to be able to interoperate like never before.", "year": 2013, "month": 11, "day": 9}

Ploshay\nBitcoin continues to grow in value and BTC China, the lead Chinese Bitcoin exchange and one of the lead Bitcoin exchanges in the world, is expanding tremendously. Bitcoin Magazine received a transcribed and translated copy of Yang Yang of 8BTC\u2019s interview with Bobby Lee, CEO of BTC China and co-founder Yang Linke.\nPlease feel free to read in English while watching the youtube video below:\nhttp://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNjMwNjQzOTYw.html\nYang Yang: Hello everyone. Today we are having an interview with the founder of BTCChina, Mr. Yang Linke and CEO Bobby Lee. Would you like to give us a self-introduction?\nYang Linke: Hello. I\u2019m Yang Linke of BTCC. I\u2019d like to express my gratitude for all the support in the past few years.\nBobby Lee: Hello. I\u2019m Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCC. Glad to be here today.\nYang Yang: Thank you both for the interview. Mr. Yang and Mr. Lee, would you give us a brief introduction of the history of BTCC? As we know, it is one of the first exchanges in China.\nYang Linke: I established BTCC in June 2011 with one of my friends who has technical background. We\u2019ve been doing the business for over 2 years. In April this year Bobby Lee joined us and he became the CEO to lead the company.\nYang Yang: Why did you choose Bobby to be the CEO?\nYang Linke: In April of this year Bitcoin saw a rise in its price. The price was so high at that time: more than 1900 RMB. Bobby came to visit me then and he also thought it was a very promising industry. He wanted to work with us to make Bitcoin better-known in China. Our trading platform also improved when Bobby joined us. He has a lot of experience working in multinational companies, which benefits our company a lot.\nYang Yang: It is said that Bobby and Charles Lee, founder of LTC, are brothers.\nBobby: Yes, he is my biological brother.\nYang Yang: You came back to China and joined BTCC. Are you preparing for a global expansion of the company?\nBobby Lee: I actually came back to China 7 years ago and stayed in Shanghai for a period. I worked for a different company for the past few years. My dream was to join the Bitcoin industry and help develop BTCC.\nYang Yang: Mr. Yang, I heard you were in the leather goods business?\nYang Linke: I used to be involved in some projects which were producing equipments for regimen. I also did keep an eye on the Internet. When I came across Bitcoin I thought this was a promising project and didn\u2019t hesitate to participate in it. That was why I established the BTCC platform.\nBobby: Bitcoin is like Internet in 20 years ago. The first time I used the Internet was 20 years ago, when I was at Stanford. I started to use a browser in 1993 or 1994. My major was computer science then, so I had an earlier chance than others to use it. So, today the Bitcoin industry is quite like Internet in 1990s. I always regret that I didn\u2019t drop out of Stanford and start a business myself. I joined Yahoo and worked there for 8 years after I graduated as a MCS. I did gain a lot of experience at Yahoo, and learned how to operate and develop an Internet-based company. When I joined Yahoo, there were less than 500 people, but now it is such a large company. I hope I can also work with Yang Linke to help BTCC grow like this.\nYang Yang: There are many BTC exchanges in China currently. A lot of new exchanges have appeared this year. Your company is now the largest in China. Have you been attacked by hackers in the past?\nBobby Lee: Yes. This last month we were under attack by hackers with DDoS. Since we are now the largest exchange in China, some people attack us on purpose, or just for fun.\nYang Yang: In March of this year FxBTC attacked you verbally, claiming that you attacked FxBTC\u2019s website. Can you explain the background?\nYang Linke: First we didn\u2019t attack FxBTC\u2019s website, and we considered that accusation unfounded. After FxBTC was attacked, they posted on some threads on some forums and branded us as the attacker. As a matter of fact, I didn\u2019t even know how to conduct a DDoS attack. After he posted on that thread, I requested that he take it down and sent him a lawyer\u2019s letter. I didn\u2019t get any reply then, but they did pull off the thread after some time. We can see from this case that the industry is now still a bit chaotic.\nYang Yang: Bitcoin is still a new thing in China. Didn\u2019t you worry about the legal aspects when you established BTCC? A license should have been required then, right?\nYang Linke: We did it just for fun at first. To be honest, we didn\u2019t consider those legal things. But now we\u2019ve already registered in Shanghai and we will comply with regulations in China.\nBobby Lee: Indeed Bitcoin is still in a grey area now in China. Officially speaking it is not legal, but it is not illegal either. I believe policies would be made for Bitcoin in the future. We shall do everything we can to comply with our government and our country.\nYang Yang: That\u2019s why you would like to register in China? So the legal risk is quite high?\nYang Linke: I\u2019d like to have additional comments on this. There are actually a lot of companies in the industry, like p2p loan companies. They are also facing this problem. Some of them have taken steps further than Bitcoin. It would still take some time for this country to understand what is happening.\nYang Yang: What Mt.Gox faces is the US government freezing their account. Right now only the Japanese Yen can be withdrawn from them. So do you think when the trading volume of BTCC has reached a certain level, the government will also jump in? What if the money in your bank account is freezed? Any emergency plan?\nBobby Lee: Mt.Gox is doing business in the USA as well as in other countries. I heard that Mt.Gox did break some laws in the USA. They didn\u2019t get a license when they were dealing with cash business. We\u2019ve already registered in China and we put our customers\u2019 money in a third-party company.\nYang Yang: So what if the personal account of Mr. Yang or other colleagues is frozen?\nBobby Lee: We don\u2019t use personal accounts. We use a corporate account.\nYang Yang: Right. So if your corporate account is frozen, the money deposited by your customers would not be in jeopardy.\nBobby Lee: Yes. Money from our customers should be protected.\nYang Yang: May I ask how much money your customers have deposited in BTCC?\nBobby Lee: We couldn\u2019t answer that.\nYang Yang: Someone also complained that when the price of Bitcoin reached 266USD in April, it was hard to trade in BTCC. When all bids and asks had to be in queue, the matching process took a long time. What was the cause then?\nBobby Lee: Let me answer this question. In April when the price was high, the engine of our system was indeed very slow. You could still buy or sell then, but had to be in queue. It takes around ten minutes to match the bids after you placed an order. Same problem also happened to Mt.Gox, if my memory is correct. The delay in Mt.Gox was more than 2 hours. We\u2019ve perfected our website now so this problem should not arise from now on.\nYang Yang: You are one of the first exchanges here and you did charge a high percent of commission. Why didn\u2019t you put in more money to improve the website?\nBobby Lee: Actually we did. We spent a lot of time in the past few months in this area. For example, in the last week the trade volume in our website reached 50,000 BTC, our highest record, which was even higher than Mt.Gox. The record before April was 28,000 BTC, while we reached the level of 40,000 BTC in October. So you can see there were several consecutive days when our trade volume was higher than Mt.Gox. So technically the problem would arise again. But of course the price of your order should be reasonable to be matched.\nYang Yang: There was a fraud recently with an exchange called GBL. Apparently GBL cheated its customers as the company head stole all customers\u2019 money and disappeared. May I know you opinion to it?\nBobby Lee: We don\u2019t know too much about it. But we don\u2019t feel surprised about it. Someone did an investigation about this industry before and concluded that more than half [of the] companies would cease operation within one year. That\u2019s why we keep promising our customers that we are doing a long-term business. In 2011 there were three exchanges while now only one (BTCC) [is] left. You can see there are a lot more exchanges established this year and we believe half of them will disappear. Some may lack proper management and some have malicious fraud. We are always trying to make money by doing the right thing. That\u2019s also what we would like to deliver through this interview.\nYang Yang: Do you have your team of lawyers to deal with questions from outside your company as well as legal issues you might encounter later on?\nBobby Lee: Yes. We have a team specific for this aspect. We are very serious about the political, legal and financial facets. Our principle is to prioritize our nation and our people, and to comply with the laws and policies of our government.\nYang Yang: Is BTCC going to accept other currencies besides RMB?\nBobby Lee: Hard to tell. It depends on the openness of China. Legally speaking, RMB is the only fiat currency in China. We may only accept RMB, as foreign exchanges are complicated.\nYang Yang: Who do you think is your strongest competitor?\nBobby Lee: They must be from traditional industry as Bitcoin wouldn\u2019t just disappear suddenly someday. We are actually competing with ourselves. What concerns us most would be if our customers don\u2019t believe in Bitcoin anymore.\nYang Yang: So you don\u2019t worry about the P2P exchanges? Like Peatio and Bitshare.\nBobby Lee: They might focus on [a] different market. We do keep an eye on them.\nYang Yang: Recently the trade volume of BTCC is higher than other exchanges in the world. Do you think it\u2019s because a large sum of money was pumped into the market or just because of some short-term speculation?\nBobby Lee: Actually in the past few weeks the trade volume did increase. Old users as well as new ones are willing to trade here because we are the most stable, most reliable exchange. So quantitatively speaking, we could have a reasonable guess that the price of Bitcoin in BTCC is now acting as an anchor for [the] global market. Maybe it\u2019s because we don\u2019t charge our customers transaction fees.\nYang Yang: Why did you decide not to charge your customers for transactions? Except for fiat money withdrawal, every transaction including depositing and withdrawing Bitcoin, buying and selling Bitcoin, is now free.\nBobby Lee: We were asked the same question in September. We are trying to promote the Bitcoin business and make it more widespread.\nYang Yang: Or maybe just because other exchanges in China started to avoid charging their customers a fee?\nBobby Lee: We were actually the first one to not charge. After we announced this decision, other exchanges just followed us.\nYang Yang: Your relationship to LTC is close. Do you think that BTCC may accept LTC someday?\nBobby Lee: A lot of people ask us about that. We don\u2019t have any comment on this at this moment, but we will keep you posted.\nYang Yang: As an old Chinese saying goes, a new boss would initiate new reforms. What do you think reforms will aim at?\nBobby Lee: We\u2019ve been working on reforms now for almost half a year. The first thing we did was to register our company in China, so we are now operating in the form of a company. We also improved our technical team and our customer service team. Our next step is to improve the customer experience on our website, since this is what Internet businesses care about most.\nYang Yang: Now many people with larger sums of money don\u2019t trade on these trading platforms. Instead they seek individuals with lots of Bitcoins to trade over the counter. Do you ever consider having VIP service for some VIP customers, so they can get their Bitcoins without influencing the market price? I think that would become a trend.\nBobby Lee: Yes, we did find some customers were trading with a lot of money. The advantage of our website is that the trading volume is quite large, so those people can get their Bitcoins easily without influencing the market price. Actually you can find some accounts trading thousands of Bitcoins in one day, and the market price is staying stable.\nYang Yang: But how can you profit when you don\u2019t make money from customers\u2019 transactions?\nBobby Lee: We earned a lot of money in the past few years. So now we can make a long-term plan, after improving our service.\nYang Yang: Could you reveal me this further plan?\nBobby Lee: I\u2019m afraid not.\nYang Yang: Thank you both for your time. We wish a great future for BTCC.\nBobby Lee: Thanks.", "year": 2013, "month": 11, "day": 8}

{"title": "Bitcoin\u2019s New All-time High: Exploring the Latest Bubble", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoins-new-all-time-high-exploring-the-latest-bubble-1384043065/", "birthday": "Nov 9, 2013  7:24 PM EST", "date": "2013-11-10 00:24:00", "content": "Only six months after the Bitcoin price last reached an all-time high of $266 in April, Bitcoin is shooting up yet again. The rise started almost immediately after the beginning of October, when the anonymous market Silk Road was shut down and its owner arrested; although the price did drop down from $127 to a low of $85 on Bitstamp, it recovered quickly, and soon started rising from $127 at an average rate at over three percent per day. After a brief crash and consolidation at $200, Bitcoin kept rising again, and soon finally hit its new all-time high.\nFirst of all, what is different between the post-crash period this year and that in 2011? The main answer is, this time the recovery came much more quickly. While in 2011 the Bitcoin price kept steadily dropping for over five months, losing over 93% of its value compared to is peak before finally starting a slow and arduous recovery that would last all the way through 2012. Here, the situation was different. The price dropped to a low of $50.01 on MtGox a mere three days after the spike to $266 and the subsequent crash; if one could anthropomorhize the mind of the market at the time, we might hear something like \"yeah, we know the price is going to crash hard, let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s get it over with already\". From there, the market quickly recovered, and although a more protracted two-month-long secondary slump did follow, the price never again fell below $65. Why did this happen? Essentially, the market was more experienced. Many of the market participants had already been through the hard crash in 2011, and knew exactly what was going to come.\n\nWhat is more interesting, however, is the peculiar characteristics that make this rise different from the last. The first difference is one that is subtle, and difficult to quantify in terms of statistics. And that is this: the rise from December 2012 to April 2013 was marked by a flurry of positive news in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Wordpress started accepting Bitcoin in November, Bitcoin Central made a first-of-its kind deal with a licensed payment processor in France in December, and January saw a flurry of positive news around the Bitcoin gambling industry. Finally, during February, the month during which the price made its last leg up before crossing the $31.91 peak that it set back in 2011, the list of Bitcoin-accepting businesses was joined by Mega and Reddit, and the internet Archive became the most prominent organization to pay its employees in Bitcoin.\nWhat do we have today? Essentially, Baidu Jiasule. So in what specific ways is the Bitcoin ecosystem better today than it was six months ago? Essentially, the answer is a subtractive one: the Bitcoin ecosystem got rid of risk. In May, everyone was concerned about the regulatory consequences of the FinCEN guidance detailing legal guidelines for Bitcoin users and exchanges. Since then, however, many countries around the world have clarified Bitcoin\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s tax status, Germany gave Bitcoin official recognition as a private currency, and even China and India had government officials come out to say that they do not intend to regulate Bitcoin for the time being. The other major risk factor that the Bitcoin ecosystem lost was economic centralization. In April, MtGox had over 70% market share in the Bitcoin exchange industry, BitPay was by far the largest payment processor, and the Bitcoin drug market, which many thought was crucial to the Bitcoin economy, was dominated by Silk Road. Since then, MtGox\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s market share has been eclipsed by those of Bitstamp and BTCChina, BitPay has been joined by Coinbase, to a lesser extent BIPS and now Circle, and at the beginning of October the last point of vulnerability, Silk Road, was shut down - and Bitcoin\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s prices soon went up rather than down. Today, the only centralization that remains is a technical one: the monopoly of the bitcoind source code, and even that is open-source and governed by a semi-public development process.\nThis rally is also different from the last in terms of technical analysis. The Bitcoin markets, as well as many other markets, follow very clear patterns. The most common of these is the concept of a psychological threshold. This graph shows quite well the general effect:\n\nHere, the price reached a level slightly below 30 USD, fought against the threshold for days, and then finally breached it and entered a minor bubble up to 31.3 USD, before crashing and consolidating slightly above 30. Threshold effects can happen in two places: at psychologically significant numbers (eg. $30, $200), and at previous peaks. So what is different now compared to then? Then, these effects took place entirely on MtGox, and the other exchanges closely followed MtGox\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s behavior. This time, there are three major exchanges: MtGox, Bitstamp and BTCChina, and each one has a life of its own. Here are BTCChina\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s battle against 1000 CNY:\n\nAnd 2000 CNY:\n\nAnd here is the rise of the Bitstamp price from $180 to $230:\n\nHere, notice how the Bitstamp price actually broke two successive thresholds. First, it spent days breaking through the peak of $206 that it made before its brief crash to $160. Soon after it does, however, once can also see another, smaller plateau lasting only a few hours. This is actually the BTCChina price brushing up against its own peak of 1339 CNY.\nWhat this means is two things. First, there are far more thresholds that the Bitcoin price will need to break through, and not all of them will be obvious. We may see a minor battle as MtGox brushes against a certain price threshold, and then another larger battle as Bitstamp hits it a day later, and then BTCChina force a consolidation after approaching a round number measured in Chinese yuan. Second, the effect of each threshold will be lower. North American and European speculators may be excited about the prospect of Bitcoin hitting 1000 USD, but for Chinese users the threshold is much less interesting; they are more closely watching for Bitcoin to break 10000 CNY (~$700). This also creates opportunities for clever inter-exchange speculation; if the price on BTCChina breaks through 10000 CNY, it may be difficult to buy on BTCChina quickly enough to take advantage of this, so it may instead be a viable strategy to buy on Bitstamp and MtGox at that time. This threshold weakening effect will have an unknown effect on Bitcoin pice growth in general; it may cause prices to rise faster by reducing barriers, but it may also more quickly create the conditions for a large crash.\nIn what ways is this rally just like the last? Largely, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a matter of the precise nature of the correlation between price growth and media attention. Earlier this year, the growth in price preceded the growth in Google Trends volume:\n\n\nAnd this year the situation is the same:\n\n\nWhat does this mean? Essentially, that media attention on Bitcoin is largely caused by Bitcoin price rises, more so than the other way around. The effect is certainly a positive feedback loop, with both effects supporting the other, but price rises come first. Of course, there is one alternative explanation - that people inside the media companies know that they are going to write about Bitcoin ahead of time, and thus buy up bitcoins beforehand, but the fact that this effect has survived even as media organizations in the US, Europe and China are now reporting on Bitcoin suggests that it is not too likely to be taking place to a significant extent.\nWelcome to the third great Bitcoin bubble; we certainly do live in interesting times.", "year": 2013, "month": 11, "day": 10}

Just this past week, Vanity Cosmetic Surgery chose to accept payment for services in Bitcoin. After reading a news article on BTC China taking Bitcoin to 200USD per BTC, Vanity Cosmetic Surgery\u2019s team decided to accept Bitcoin as a method of payment.\nVanity Cosmetic Surgery issued the following press release:\nMiami, Florida (PRWEB) November 02, 2013\nSince Vanity began doing business, they have gone through extraordinary lengths to facilitate payment options for their international patients. Since they treat people from all over the world, they usually accepted most major currencies, but now with the implementation of Bitcoin they open the doors to new possibilities in cyberspace. By doing this, Vanity becomes the only medical center in the world to accept Bitcoins as an official payment method. Patients may request to pay with Bitpoints, when they call or visit any of their three centers in South Florida. These innovative services benefits anyone, especially foreigners who do not want to exchange their currency for US dollars, who already have a Bitcoin account.\nWhat does this mean to patients? They can now use their loaded Bitcoin account to pay for a breast augmentation or a nose job, or maybe a laser hair removal treatment. This will definitely transform the way people will choose their doctors in the near future.\nInitially any currency could be converted into this internet token, but now the other way around is possible, with the new ATM machines installed in some places across the globe. Bitcoins can usually be used to pay things with a cellphone or in certain online stores. As such, once Bitcoin\u2019s concept becomes global, traveling around would not require monetary exchange, as more brick-and-mortar businesses start to welcome this new payment method. For users the Bitcoin website offers a lot of security measures for a minor price.\nAbout Bitcoin Exchange\nBitcoin has become a universally accepted internet currency. It\u2019s free to open an account. At Localbitcoins.com, Bitcoins can be used to buy and sell anything, as long as the information required is available. In most transactions, security fees may not be required.\nAbout Vanity Cosmetic Surgery:\nVanity CS performs the most variety of plastic surgeries in all the South Coast. They have become famous for performing the most Trans-umbilical breast augmentation surgeries in the US, making them an authority when it comes to TUBA surgery. This versatility draws patients from all over the US and the world. Their large 5,000 square feet state-of-the-art facility makes them the biggest plastic surgery center in South Florida. They can be found in Miami, Hialeah and Plantation. They currently offer TUBA (Trans-umbilical breast augmentation), liposuction, butt-lift, breast reduction and many other kinds of cosmetic surgeries.\nBitcoin Magazine had an opportunity to interview Carlos Yela of Vanity Cosmetic Surgery.\nBitcoin Magazine (BM): When did you first hear about Bitcoin?\nCarlos Yela (CY): A couple of months ago I found several discussions online about Bitcoin being a new trend and how China was getting more involved in it.\nBM: What was it about Bitcoin that you found interesting?\nCY: I think that Bitcoin itself is revolutionary, It\u2019s a total new way of creating wealth and trade, and its growing popularity rate is so extraordinary.\nBM: When did you first get the idea for your organization/site/services and what inspired you to create the site?\nCY: Vanity Cosmetic Surgery is a well established cosmetic surgery center that in only 5 years has become the largest center of its kind in the state.\nBM: Where do you see organization/site/services going in a year?\nCY: At this point we are expanding our presence in the web, this is a strategy to promote our services not only in our local market but nationally and internationally as well, this strategy will allow us to become the number 1 plastic surgery center to receive patients from other states.\nBM: What makes your product stand out in comparison to other products/businesses utilizing Bitcoin?\nCY: We are not only the largest and most comprehensive center in the state with the widest variety of procedures available, but we also have a medical team of 6 of the best plastic surgeons in the East Coast as well as the best facilities, we only use the latest equipment available for all our procedures and treatments and always in the cleanest and most sanitized environment.\nBM: What are your suggestions for individuals hoping to use Bitcoin in a business like yours?\nCY: Our suggestion for Bitcoin users is for them to make up their mind if they are thinking of getting some cosmetic procedure done, we are the best option for many reasons: price, service, quality, accessibility and most important we are located in the most touristic city of the United States; when people come to our center from other places, they don\u2019t only receive our excellent service but they enjoy our beautiful weather and beaches here in South Florida.", "year": 2013, "month": 11, "day": 11}

The Bitcoin Alliance of Canada\u2019s main distinguishing feature is its highly democratic organizational structure; unlike most other national organizations, the board of directors was chosen by a selection committee that anyone in Canada had the opportunity to participate in. In the first part of this series, we talked about what the Alliance is, how it was formed and what distinguishes it from other Bitcoin organizations. Here, Anthony Di Iorio shares his thoughts on how and why he founded the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, and what the future of both the Alliance and the Canadian Bitcoin community as a whole might bring.\nVitalik Buterin: Talk about who you were before Bitcoin.\nAnthony Di Iorio: My schooling was in marketing and business, but I\u2019ve always had a passion for Computers and technology I worked in my family business, which was a sliding door manufacturing company, until it was sold in the mid-2000s. In 2007, I got into green technology; I started a geothermal drilling company, and I did that for a couple of years; it was successful, it did well. It involved drilling holes hundreds of feet deep into the earth to heat and cool buildings using the Earth\u2019s temperature. I got out of the operations and pushed the drilling off to another company, that continued doing the drilling work, allowing me to free up my time. At this time, I also had some rental properties, but due to what is in my opinion the imminent collapse of the housing market in Canada, I sold the properties. Looking for investments, I first heard about Bitcoin in the middle of last year and soon fell down the rabbit hole. It has enveloped me ever since. A month after that, I started the Toronto Bitcoin community meetup group.\nVB: So what happened next?\nADI: At that time Butterfly Labs was announcing their miners, and I made a decision of whether or not I would get involved in mining, but I decided to invest into Bitcoin instead. I didn\u2019t like Butterfly Labs as a company; that involved their attitude, customer support and how they were treating their customers, and I decided that it was just not a company I wanted to work with. I follow mining a little bit, but it\u2019s not something that I really got involved in; there was just so much other stuff going on, it\u2019s hard to get involved with everything. I invested a sizable amount into Bitcoin when it was at $10, I started the meetup group, then created SatoshiCircle (which we\u2019ll discuss in the 3rd part of this article), then I founded the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada. From then on everything that I\u2019ve done has been Bitcoin-related full time. Now, after selling SatoshiCircle a few months back I\u2019m fully committed to the Alliance and building Bitcoin communities.\nVB: Could you explain how and why you created the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada?\nADI: This was all during the media frenzy in April, so seeing the interviews that were going on on national TV in Canada I really felt that there was a lack of proper representation of Bitcoin, a lack of good quality people to talk to media and promote Bitcoin, and that\u2019s where the concept for the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada started. And from there, our goals expanded.\nMy concept for the Alliance was a nonprofit organization of Bitcoin enthusiasts, volunteers that were interested in coming together to represent Bitcoin in Canada. In April I put out a press release making a general call for anyone that wanted to get involved. Over the next two to three months I communicated with hundreds of people across Canada. After a few more press releases and a last call for involvement, it was time to put together the board of directors. Through input from the community, it was decided that two groups would be commissioned: one group of board applicants, and another group to serve as an independent board election committee. Of the thirteen applicants, seven board members were ultimately elected by the fifteen-member election committee. Having applied myself, I became a member of the board.\nThe structure of the Alliance is key. It\u2019s a bottom-up approach that I feel is the best model to approach community building. It\u2019s a longer approach that\u2019s cautious, as you\u2019re not just announcing your plans fully formed and dictating everything to the community, but I believe it\u2019s one that everyone can be happy with at the end.\nVB: What\u2019s the Alliance\u2019s status on its negotiations with the Bitcoin Foundation?\nADI: Because we\u2019re so well on our way to developing this national organization, with directors, committees, legal counsel and accountants already onboard, we were asked by the Foundation to take part in their international chapter/affiliate program as a test model. I spoke with Jon Matonis and had a lengthy talk about what his vision was for the Foundation. I laid out our background and our thoughts for the Alliance. In the end out board decided that, although our board would like to work with the Foundation, we need to continue to push forward independently for the time being. We believe the proposal from the Foundation is not developed sufficiently at this point, and would hold us back for a period that we\u2019re not willing to commit to.\nVB: What point is the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada at right now?\nADI: We have a seven-member elected board, and nine committees each run by a board member. We have an official legal counsel and two accountants. All of us are working pro bono in a volunteer effort. I\u2019ve been elected Executive Director by the board, and I\u2019m committing myself on a full-time basis to this role. I work with many leaders on a day-to-day basis; currently we are adding advisors and expertise to our committees, developing our membership structure and building towards our official public launch next month. We\u2019re also at a point where we\u2019re encouraging other national leaders to contact us for assistance or to just share our resources and help any national group get off the ground. If this sounds interesting to you, feel free to contact us.\n[Di Iorio makes himself available by email at [email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=\"currentScript\"in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\"),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\"cf-hash\"))return t[e]}();if(t&&t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(\"data-cfemail\");if(a){for(e=\"\",r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]> */]\nVB: How do you feel about the current and future state of Bitcoin business in Canada?\nADI: There is definitely a growth of Bitcoin businesses in Canada. We\u2019re seeing meetup events specifically focusing on Bitcoin businesses, entrepreneurs and merchant services. We have CaVirtex, the largest exchange in Canada,developing their own BitPay-esque merchant services. They\u2019ve hired salaried employees to go signing up merchants, so that\u2019s a big step. One of our board members is involved in CaVirtex, and he is running the merchant committee in the Alliance as well. The Alliance is working with CaVirtex, and we intend to reach out to all Bitcoin businesses, listen to them, and see how we can assist them in developing the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nIt\u2019s important to get brick-and-mortar businesses onboard with Bitcoin; this will be a focus of the Alliance. I believe you want to target people that are technically inclined and want to be leaders in their industry; those are the types of people that are going to be the most receptive to Bitcoin, I think. What we need to let business owners know is this: there is a huge press opportunity for you to get involved, it\u2019s free to set up, and you can pay lower fees compared to traditional credit card and debit card purchases, so there will be an opportunity to pass along savings to customers. You don\u2019t need to be a speculator in Bitcoin; you can transfer your Bitcoin revenues to dollars in your bank account as frequently as you would like. There is very little reason not to accept Bitcoin if you are a merchant or business owner today. Heck, my lawyer accepts Bitcoin, and my accountant accepts Bitcoin, so there are people out there.\nHey, we\u2019re still very early. We, me, you, the people at the conference are building this foundation of grassroots enthusiasts. How long will it be before large corporations and banks are getting involved? From the circus of things, it looks like banks are trying to shut things down. My long-term view is the opposite of that. As old-school as many banks are, it\u2019s only going to take a couple forward-thinking institutions to realize that Bitcoin is the future and get onboard. I believe the mining space will be a target, as will the exchanges. It will be an arms race in the next few years as banks from around the world start trying to control the means of production in the mining space, and the means of transaction, which are exchanges. We in the grassroots level must do our best to develop communities, develop collaboration, and develop cooperation. We have to efficiently develop local, national and international cooperation, yet ensure that along the way you\u2019re still promoting independence and decentralization. It\u2019s these groups that will educate the public and counteract potential corporate takeover. That being said, I\u2019m very optimistic of the future of Bitcoin, and even more optimistic of the future of cryptocurrency.\nVB: Canada has often been praised as a particularly Bitcoin-friendly jurisdiction, with the Canadian anti-money-laundering agency FINTRAC telling Bitcoin exchanges that they do not need licenses. What do you think is the regulatory future of Bitcoin?\nADI: I think we are considered lenient right now, but I think that it\u2019s going to eventually be controlled by what the banks want. And I think being in Canada we will need to listen a lot to what\u2019s going on in the US, as we have a tendency to follow our southern neighbors. I think the Canadian government and regulatory bodies are taking a \u201csit back and wait\u201d approach right now in terms of regulation, but I don\u2019t see that lasting very long. I don\u2019t want people to get over-optimistic about what\u2019s going on in Canada at this point; Stu Hoegner, our legal counsel, has the same kind of thinking, which he relayed at the London conference. That being said, many people think Canada is a great place to start a Bitcoin business right now. We\u2019ve had talk with American companies that are thinking of starting operations over here; in my opinion the US isn\u2019t looking very welcoming to Bitcoin, which is unfortunate. However, countries that are welcoming any type of businesses in emerging technologies are going to be reaping the rewards in the end.\nSee also: part 1 and part 3 of this series.", "year": 2013, "month": 10, "day": 17}
{"title": "BITCOINSTELLATIONS", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoinstellations-1382120835/", "birthday": "Oct 18, 2013  2:27 PM EST", "date": "2013-10-18 19:27:00", "content": "Time to have fun solving some puzzles!\nThis post was released for Issue 12 of Bitcoin Magazine as the first one of a series of\u00a0 articles about puzzles and games. I hope you enjoy reading them as much as I enjoy writing them.\n\u00a0\nThis puzzle evolved into my second published game (Hexellation, 2009). Hexellation uses a hexhex board (a hexagon made of hexagons), but for practical purposes we\u2019ll use square grids here, so you can easily play with paper and pencil. In Hexellation, two players try to create a constellation of stars called \u2018model\u2019 without creating a forbidden constellation called \u2018avoid\u2019.\n\u00a0In this issue\u2019s puzzle, we\u2019ll focus on the \u2018forbidden something\u2019 mechanism only. I\u2019ve always been fascinated by games with constraint mechanisms, where you try to achieve your goals while dealing with prohibitions. Does it sound familiar to you? Life itself.\n\u00a0Don\u2019t miss the next issues of Bitcoin Magazine, as I will talk about how an automated game-generating programme also used this type of mechanism in 2007, when it created the first game ever invented by a computer.\n\u00a0THE PUZZLE\n\u00a0We\u2019ll start by drawing two square grids of the same size next to each other (10 squares per side, for example, although you can use any size). The left one will be called \u2018avoid\u2019 and the right one will be the \u2018sky map\u2019. Now we\u2019ll place a few stars (3, for example) on the \u2018avoid\u2019 grid, randomly. This arrangement of stars is the forbidden constellation.\n\nFigure 1: a forbidden constellation\n\u00a0The goal of the puzzle is to place as many stars as possible on the sky map in such way that the forbidden constellation is not present on it, even by rotation. A constellation symmetrical to the forbidden one is allowed, as long as it is not also identical by rotation.\n\u00a0For example, the red constellations in figure 2 are illegal, as they are the same as the forbidden one (some of them are rotated). On the other hand, the green constellation is legal, as it is not the same as the forbidden one, no matter how you rotate it.\n\nFigure 2: examples of legal and illegal arrangements of stars\n\u00a0A sky map that does not contain the forbidden constellation will be called a \u2018proper sky map\u2019. The sky map in figure 2 contains the forbidden constellation three times (indicated in red), so it is not a proper sky map. Remember that the configuration indicated in green is correct.\n\u00a0The proper sky map that contains the maximum number of stars possible for a given forbidden constellation will be its \u2018solution\u2019 (there can be several different solutions for a given forbidden constellation). The number of stars of a solution varies depending on the configuration and number of stars of the forbidden constellation.\n\u00a0Figures 3 and 4 show examples of solutions for trivial cases of forbidden constellations. The solution for the forbidden constellation in figure 3 has the maximum number of stars possible (99 stars).\n\nFigure 3: a trivial constellation and its solution\n\u00a0By simply re-arranging the four stars into a 2x2 square (figure 4) we significantly reduce the number of stars of its solution to 75. Notice that none of the 25 remaining free spaces can be filled with a star, as it will complete a forbidden constellation and the sky map will not be a solution.\n\nFigure 4: a 2x2 constellation and its solution\n\u00a0STRATEGY TIP\n\u00a0Don\u2019t read this tip if you wish to discover the strategies by yourself!\n\u00a0An initial procedure to properly fill the sky map might be the following:\n\u00a0a) Start with an empty sky map.\nb) Create a constellation on the sky map identical to the forbidden constellation.\nc) Remove one of the stars from this newly created constellation. Let\u2019s call it \u2018stamp constellation\u2019.\nd) Replicate the stamp constellation as many times as possible on the sky map while avoiding creating the forbidden constellation.\ne) Legally fill as many remaining spaces as possible.\n\nFigure 5: a procedure to fill the sky map (steps \u2018a\u2019 to \u2018d\u2019)\n\u00a0And now, are you ready for the challenges?\n\u00a0THE CHALLENGES\n\u00a0Time to solve some puzzles! The following challenges are sorted by difficulty level, ranging from \u2018immediate\u2019 to \u2018almost impossible\u2019.\n\u00a0Challenge 1: Can you find the smallest forbidden constellation for this proper sky map (fig. 6)? This one is easier than it seems and there are many possible answers.\n\nFigure 6: the Bitcoin sky map\n\u00a0Challenge 2: Can you find a solution for this forbidden constellation (fig. 7)?\n\nFigure 7: the Bitcoinstellation\n\u00a0Challenge 3: Can you find a solution for this forbidden constellation (fig. 8)?\n\nFigure 8: the brainburner\nChallenge 4: Can you find a 4-star forbidden constellation so that its solution contains the lowest number of stars possible?\n\u00a0Challenge 5: Can you generalize this result for any grid and constellation size?\n\u00a0Challenge 6: Can you solve challenges 4 and 5 for a hexhex grid?\nforum", "year": 2013, "month": 10, "day": 18}
{"title": "Internationality, Democracy and Reforming the Bitcoin Foundation", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/internationality-democracy-and-reforming-the-bitcoin-foundation-1382154402/", "birthday": "Oct 18, 2013  11:46 PM EST", "date": "2013-10-19 04:46:00", "content": "Ever since the Bitcoin Foundation was first announced by lead Bitcoin protocol developer Gavin Andresen in September 2012, it has been the subject of constant criticism. An organization that describes itself on the front page of its website as having the mission of \u201cfreeing people to transact on their own terms\u201d and \u201cstandardizing, protecting and promoting the use of Bitcoin cryptographic money for the benefit of users worldwide\u201d, has alternately been called a wealthy Silicon Valley business club, a United States-focused organization, or a group of wannabe dictators trying to unilaterally impose their visions on the Bitcoin community. Some have even accused the Foundation of wanting to centralize Bitcoin and transform the project into a more regulator-friendly product without its more controversial properties for their own personal gain. At the same time, however, the Foundation has proven to be an invaluable tool in supporting Bitcoin\u2019s growth. It is paying a full-time salary to Gavin Andresen, forcefully and proactively defending Bitcoin in front of regulators, and paying out grants to projects that would have a hard time funding themselves otherwise. As Bitcoin continues to grow, local communities are seeing the benefits that formal organization, properly done, can bring, and a single question is increasingly coming to the forefront of the public discussion: what is wrong with the Bitcoin Foundation, and how can we fix it?\nConspiracy theories aside, the Bitcoin Foundation certainly has made efforts to address every one of the concerns that have been leveled against it. Claims that the Foundation was not democratic were addresses with an election in September. Concerns over conflicts of interest escalated to a climax when Coinlab, a Bitcoin business whose CEO Peter Vessenes was on the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s board of directors, sued MtGox (whose CEO Mark Karpeles is also on the board) in May; however, the crisis was resolved when Peter Vessenes stepped down in July. The perception that the Bitcoin Foundation harbored too much of a pro-regulatory ideology was weakened when Jon Matonis, a known proponent of underground and informal economies, became the executive director after Vessenes. And, finally, the issue of internationality was addressed with the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s new international chapter program.\nEspecially after the election in September, many people\u2019s perceptions of the Bitcoin Foundation have improved considerably, as they saw some of the recent reforms, and perhaps also the electoral victory of Elizabeth Ploshay over other, more business-oriented, candidates, as a sign that the Foundation\u2019s leadership is genuinely interested in making the organization more fairly organized and inclusive. To others, however, the electoral results and the international chapter program were simply proof that, ultimately, everything remains exactly the same. The two winners of the board election, Elizabeth Ploshay and Micky Malka, are both in the United States, cementing the perception that the Bitcoin Foundation was an irretrievably US-focused organization. And, as Bitcoin Alliance of Canada founder Anthony Di Iorio believes, this result was to be expected. Because the original five directors, with the exception of Mark Karpeles, were all American, the Foundation attracted a predominantly American member base, which was then more likely to elect Americans. \u201cIn my opinion,\u201d Di Iorio summarizes, \u201cthey were structurally flawed from the start, and in turn this skewed the membership very early on\u201d.\nTransparency and Democracy\nThe other topic dear to Di Iorio\u2019s heart is that of transparency and democracy. The Bitcoin Alliance of Canada is unique among Bitcoin organizations because of how the organization was created democratically, and transparently, right from the start. As Di Iorio describes it:\nIn April I put out a press release making a general call for anyone that wanted to get involved. Over the next two to three months I communicated with hundreds of people across Canada. After a few more press releases and a last call for involvement, it was time to put together the board of directors. Through input from the community, it was decided that two groups would be commissioned: one group of board applicants, and another group to serve as an independent board election committee. Of the thirteen applicants, seven board members were ultimately elected by the fifteen-member election committee. Having applied myself, I became a member of the board.\nAlthough Di Iorio certainly did take leadership in the Alliance\u2019s formation, he did so publicly and openly and gave everyone months of advance warning before every critical step so that everyone could have ample chance to participate. Compare to that the story of how the Bitcoin Foundation was created: in August, Gavin Andresen let slip that there would be some big news coming up in September. Over the next few weeks, Andresen let the Bitcoin community speculate on what the news was going to be, and at the end of September Andresen abruptly announced the organization, fully formed, to the world in a forum post. The five original directors were all established Bitcoin business leaders, who received their spots automatically, essentially simply because they were in the right place at the right time. And even today, all but two directors were appointed, and all but three part of the same original group.\nThe International Chapter Scandal\nThe worst part of the backlash, however, has revolved around the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s international chapter. Some in the Foundation see its efforts at trying to get organizations in other countries to sign on as national chapters as a genuine attempt at diversification, but the opinion in other parts of the world is different; in fact, what many Bitcoin users see is what is essentially an American organization expanding out into the world much like a megacorporation, or even a neo-colonial empire. What is the difference between genuine international outreach and neocolonialism? The story of Ron Gross, a co-founder of the Israeli Bitcoin meetup group and soon to be Israeli Bitcoin Association, proves instructive. Gross says:\nSo we started talking about forming the Israeli Bitcoin Foundation, as we called it, and the vision was always to be a chapter of the Global Foundation, even before they came out and publicly announced that there was a chapter program. We needed an organization for Israel, and we wanted to cooperate with the Foundation. We approached the Foundation and started a dialogue, and we were then selected as one of the five countries to work with the alpha program for the chapters; we discussed this locally, and then we started getting the terms from them.So first we got the more general terms in an email, and then we got the official contract that they proposed. Basically, they proposed a sort of a revenue sharing model, where they will collect all of the member fees and the donations and within a certain period, maybe on month, they will transfer a half of that \u2013 a half of the member fees and a half of the donations \u2013 to us. And we won\u2019t have any option of accepting either of these on our own.\nAt that point, the Israeli Bitcoin community members discussed internally and agreed that, while the 50% membership revenue split might be reasonable, there was no way they would be willing to deny people the right to donate specifically to the Israeli group directly. They then started to reach out to other national organizations, and what they found was a growing consensus that the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s conduct, as they perceived it, was unacceptable:\nWe just had a few meetings in Amsterdam, and they were all in the same situation as us. They received the same kinds of conditions, sort of a dictated proposal from above without an open dialogue, and we reached a conclusion. None of us, none of the people in that room want to just accept these kinds of conditions written in a top-down fashion by the Foundation that is effectively today a US foundation. Nobody appointed them to be the world foundation, and in the latest election even though one or more of the candidates were foreign those candidates weren\u2019t elected. The foundation is de-facto a US entity. So all of us decided that we don\u2019t want this kind of cooperation with them, and we are not sure what we are getting in exchange for all these fees that will be sent outwards.\nThis is the effect that the impression of top-down control that the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s approach provides is having on Canadian, European and Israeli community members alike: very many of them see these actions as simply yet another instance of a typical American arrogance and desire for control, and want to have no part in interacting with the Bitcoin Foundation in this way. That does not mean that they see the Foundation as evil and wish to avoid any kind of contract with them whatsoever; \u201cwe are of course open to working with the Bitcoin Foundation,\u201d Gross clarifies. \u201cWe want to include them, we don\u2019t want to fight anyone else. But we want to treat them as equal members in the global organization, and this is apparently not how they see things.\u201d\nThe Other Side of the Story\nOf course, the Bitcoin Foundation sees things very differently; in the view of the organization\u2019s current Executive Director, Jon Matonis, much of what Di Iorio, Gross and others have come out to say is the result of serious misconceptions about what the Foundation is trying to do. Rather than trying to limit local organizations\u2019 freedom, Matonis says, the objective of the contract was actually to limit the amount of effort that the organizations would need to put in. \u201cOur objective,\u201d Matonis writes, \u201cwas to provide a turnkey solution for local chapters that did not want to mess around with membership dues and the infrastructure on collecting them, and did not want to have to have a giant footprint in their country that required them to hire staff.\u201d By delegating many core functions to the Bitcoin Foundation, the contract would sharply reduce the amount of effort needed to maintain a national organization. \u201cThey could keep their full-time jobs; all they had to do was register five board members for a legal non-profit in their country, take care of some translation for the website and handle some media events in their country.\u201d\nMatonis is very aware that some national organizations would prefer to maintain their independence, and for them he is willing to offer a much more restrictive partnership that would essentially consist only of the two organizations linking to each other on their websites. The Foundation is simply offering the tighter partnership first because it feels that it would be easier for national organizations to follow, and would give them the opportunity to spend more time focusing on activities beneficial to the community within their own country rather than wasting their time on administrative work that can be better handled by the foundation.\nWhat about the concerns over the seemingly top-down imposition of the contracts? \u201cI understand that,\u201d Matonis says, but he argues that much of the animosity was the result of a misunderstanding:\nWe never received a draft from [the Israelis] or anyone. I would have been happy for someone to take the lead and give me a draft to mark up. A little bit of it is cultural; as you know the American way is to throw out something acting like it\u2019s your final offer to sign, but we negotiate more than anything. I think they didn\u2019t realize that everything in there is negotiable just because they saw it in this legal format. But yeah, give me some pushback. Don\u2019t just say no and start crying, change a paragraph and tell me what you want it to say, but I think they just burned the village instead.\nAs for the 50% tax on donations, arguably the most contentious part of the agreement, Matonis writes:\nThat\u2019s the part we have the most flexibility on. What we didn\u2019t want is for them to go solicit industry membership using the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s name and then keeping the entire industry membership to themselves because that is not really fair. We have the most flexibility on the donation side, especially the anonymous donation side. To be honest, the smallest part of our funding. The largest part is industry memberships followed by the individual memberships, and then the last category is the regular ad-hoc donations.\nSo every single term in the agreement, which Gross and many other community organizers alongside him saw as being handed down in its final form from above, was actually open to negotiation all along \u2013 especially that one term which they were uncomfortable with the most. Can this misconception simply be excused as a regrettable blunder by the Foundation and the local chapters alike? Perhaps yes; but perhaps, others might believe, the responsibility falls primarily on the Foundation for being so opaque. If the Foundation had been as open as the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada in its dealings, putting out a public draft and saying \u201cthis is the general form of the agreement we\u2019re thinking of, anyone feel free to share your own thoughts and comments\u201d, and then sending the standard contract through months of open and public negotiations, this whole scandal could have been avoided entirely.\nThe United States and the World\nAside from these concerns, there still remains one major piece of the puzzle in the drive to make the Foundation a truly fair global organization: setting up a truly equal structure where the US is not inherently at the top. Right now, the Bitcoin Foundation intends to be a worldwide organization, representing the interests of Bitcoin users no matter where they are. At the same time, however, it has many of the characteristics of a US organization: its board of directors is largely American, it focuses on US legal issues, and it is registered in the United States. In order for the Bitcoin foundation organizational structure to be truly fair, these two functions would need to be split up, with a separate US foundation acting as one of the world foundation\u2019s members just like everyone else.\nFirst of all, however, there is the question of exactly what a world foundation would actually do, and whether or not it is even necessary to have one. Ron Gross clearly believes the answer is no:\nWe tried to think, if we had a sort of global Bitcoin organization, what sort of decisions would this organization do, and we didn\u2019t find any decisions that this organization would do. It\u2019s not authorized to make changes to the Bitcoin protocol, as that is not how the Bitcoin protocol works, and regarding regulation, that is specific by country or by region.\nGross\u2019s partner in organizing the Israeli Bitcoin community, Meni Rosenfeld, has similar thoughts on the matter, arguing that \u201cthe general idea is to build the structure gradually and naturally.\u201d Rosenfeld continues: \u201cWe can start with each country building their own association, and of course share information, tips and whatever and cooperate if possible, and from there we see what kind of structure makes sense for the organization and go with that, and maybe in the future we will have something more formal if we need it.\u201d Di Iorio too shares the same views, advocating for a set of national organizations united under little more than a common charter,similar to the organizational structure of the global Green Party movement.\nMatonis, on the other hand, believes that there certainly are tasks that are most well-suited for a global organization to handle, and maintaining such an organization has clear benefits for Bitcoin users today. Matonis argues:\nBasically, some of the local country groups want to be fully independent and they do not want to share in any membership dues, which means that they would not have any of the membership dues going to compensate core developers or any of the grand programs that the Bitcoin Foundation is undertaking. Would Israel have the capacity to hire Gavin or the other developers that we are hiring? I don\u2019t think they want to do that, they want someone else to do that. And that applies to legal defense as well. If the Silk Road case turns into a key disclosure case, we\u2019re going to be submitting amicus curiae briefs defending the keyholders for Bitcoin, because it has such broad implications. If one of these pops up in Israel or Holland, and we want to make a statement, we can easily throw attorneys or resources at it, even though we\u2019re coming from another country, because it has international implications as well. If the Thailand thing was real, we would love to be there, challenging why they\u2019re banning bitcoin. So we\u2019re always on the lookout for those kinds of cases that have an impact, and it\u2019s not just the US.\n\u201cThose kinds of things cost a lot of money and need a lot of coordination with attorneys in multiple countries, and that can best be achieved by us putting together our resources,\u201d Matonis concludes. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re still less than a one-million-dollar organization.\u201d However, as far as making a world foundation that is separate from the US foundation, Matonis, and the Foundation as a whole, are actually quite sympathetic to the idea. Matonis writes:\nIt\u2019s been voted on, it just hasn\u2019t been announced yet. What I will say is that the contracts that the local affiliates sign will be with an international entity which is non-US, it will be European, and the US will end up being a chapter by the second quarter of 2014. That\u2019s the path.\nGross, however, points out one large problem with the Foundation\u2019s approach: transparency. \u201cThey are setting up a new organization registered in the UK,\u201d Gross says, \u201cThey haven\u2019t discussed this with anyone in the UK organization, they just ended up doing it in their own.\u201d Here too, even in the Foundation\u2019s process of internationalizing itself, the attitude that Gross sees as a kind of arrogance seeps through. Gross further points out that the new Foundation\u2019s directors will be exactly the same as the current Foundation\u2019s directors, although Matonis points out that this will only be during a transition phase, and later there will be a clause preventing members of the US Bitcoin Foundation from also serving on the board of the world organization. \u201cYou can\u2019t just do this in one day,\u201d Matonis explains, \u201cit takes months to organize it.\u201d\nFrom all of these examples, one common trend seeps through: a strong culture within the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s ranks of doing things unilaterally, and then telling other organizations what the plan is going to be. As Matonis would have us believe, this is just the Bitcoin Foundation taking leadership; if any other national organization or consortium of national organizations wants to step forward and put together the global organizational infrastructure, they had, and still have, the opportunity to do so. The alternative viewpoint, however, is that the Bitcoin Foundation has a lot to learn from Anthony Di Iorio\u2019s style of leadership in Canada: exercising leadership when necessary, but putting out plenty of advance warnings, requests for comment and explicitly, rather than implicitly, giving anyone a chance to participate.\nUltimately, the members of both the Bitcoin Foundation and the national chapters are doing this for us, the Bitcoin community as a whole, and as a result each and every one of us has the opportunity to speak out and influence how the process of creating a fair system of global Bitcoin organization will take place. If you feel that your wishes arenot being satisfied, feel free to speak out and make an argument as to what you think is lacking. At the same time, however, Bitcoin foundations are not governments; it is perfectly reasonable to have multiple organizations serving the same region, and if you are truly unhappy about the direction your local Bitcoin organizations are taking, you are always free to start your own; Bitcoin developer Amir Taaki\u2019s unSYSTEM is perhaps the best example. Everyone is free to cooperate, or go at it alone, as little or as much as they want. Even if we do not cooperate, however, we all still have the same objective: building a great currency.", "year": 2013, "month": 10, "day": 19}

The United States has been onboard the Bitcoin train almost from day one, with over half the core development team from the country, and in 2011 and 2012 Europe too started to pick up steam. We saw Bitcoin Central become the first exchange to secure an agreement with a licensed payment services provider in France, bitcoin.de announcing a very similar deal in Germany, conferences in London and Amsterdam, and Bitcoin interest is even growing in China. Meanwhile, Canada only had its first Bitcoin meetup groups outside of a small pocket of interest in Vancouver from late last year, and even today the Bitcoin restaurant fever has only hit the western part of the country with businesses in Vancouver and Edmonton.\nBeneath the surface, however, Bitcoin in Canada has grown rapidly over the past twelve months. The Toronto Bitcoin meetup has gone from being nonexistent to having over twenty people show up every time, a year after the first Bitcoin meetup in Montreal the city now has its own permanent Bitcoin Embassy, and other Bitcoin communities are springing up in cities from sea to sea. In fact, Bitcoin Alliance of Canada founder Anthony Di Iorio believes, the level of organization of the Bitcoin community in Canada may be more advanced than in any other country aside from the United States itself. At the conference in Amsterdam, I had a chance to sit down with Anthony Di Iorio, the founder of the Toronto Bitcoin meetup group and the recently announced Executive Director of the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, and talk with him about the developments that have been going on with regard to formal Bitcoin organizational development both in Canada and abroad.\nBut what is the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada? As Di Iorio describes it, \u201cthe Alliance is a non-profit national organization dedicated to raising awareness and adoption of bitcoin in Canada, to promoting Canadian participation in international bitcoin efforts and furthering study and research in bitcoin and other virtual currencies\u201d \u2013 in short, a sort of miniaturized Bitcoin Foundation focused on the specific needs of Canadian Bitcoin users. The organization first started in April 2013, when Di Iorio came up with the idea for the Alliance and put out press releases inviting anyone from around the country to join. The results were impressive. \u201cOver the next two to three months,\u201d Di Iorio writes, \u201cI had hundreds of people contact me from across Canada, I put out a couple more press releases to let people know what\u2019s going on, I put out one final press release as a last call, and then I sent out a group email letting those who responded know that we\u2019re going to start the process now to select the board of directors.\u201d\nDemocracy in Canada\nWhat is unique about the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, and the reason why Di Iorio is so confident in the organization\u2019s merits, is this: it is the only large-scale Bitcoin organization so far whose board of directors was democratically elected right from the start. Di Iorio invited anyone from the country to apply as a board member or join the selection panel (one could not be part of both), and gave ample opportunity for replies with multiple press releases over a three-month period. Di Iorio himself applied for the position of board member just like anyone else. No other country has done this; even in the Bitcoin Foundation itself, the original members selected themselves in a top-down manner, and only recently did the first actual election took place, bringing in Elizabeth Ploshay as a new individual member and Meyer Micky Malka as a business member representing the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Ribbit Capital. Even then, however, the two new members were both from the United States, and Di Iorio believes that this is essentially the result of a feedback loop. Because the original board of directors was from the United States, the group positioned itself to be more attractive to American Bitcoin users, which in turn led to American board members being elected. \u201cIn my opinion,\u201d Di Iorio summarizes, \u201cthey were structurally flawed from the start, and in turn this skewed the membership very early on\u201d.\nThe basic structure of the Alliance is as follows. The Board of Directors contains seven directors, including Di Iorio himself, all of whom, at this point, were chosen by the selection panel in June. The number seven was chosen arbitrarily, and is flexible; the organization\u2019s charter allows for five to nine directors at any time. Currently, five provinces are represented in the board: Ontario, Nova Scotia, Quebec, Manitoba and Alberta. There are also nine committees, each one charged with a different aspect of the organization: membership and fundraising, accounting and audit policy, legal and regulatory matters, organizational bylaws, media relations, the website, merchant and commercial relations, conventions and technical matters. Each committee is led by a board member, with some board members leading two committees to make up for the fact that there are more committees than there are board members. The organization also has a legal counsel, Stuart Hoegner, a gaming, tax and virtual currencies attorney practicing in Toronto who has spoken about Bitcoin regulatory matters at a number of conferences. Within each committee, the committee leader is tasked with identifying the specific purpose and strategy of the committee, and seeking out advisors and other volunteers to participate in the committee with them. The board of directors meet once a month, with Di Iorio himself coordinating efforts between committee leaders and committee leaders presenting reports on a monthly basis.\nThe coordination between Di Iorio and the committee leaders between the board meetings is crucial, Di Iorio explains. At the end of every board meeting, the board members decide who they will be in communication with and what their goals are for the next meeting. Between the meetings, the committee leaders go off to do their own work, but Di Iorio nevertheless maintains constant contact with each and every one of them. \u201cWe have a combined commitment of 80-90 hours per week,\u201d Di Iorio states, \u201c[We are] physically meeting, [we have] communication on Skype, we are meeting in Google Hangouts all the time, frequently \u2026 it\u2019s so much easier to talk to people directly and get their agreement and get consent for what\u2019s going on with the board.\u201d Originally, the Alliance simply relied on a forum for communication between members, but the system quickly proved inadequate for managing an organization of any size; now, Di Iorio finds that through constant personal interaction they are \u201cable to get much more done than over a forum system where we relied on people responding days apart.\u201d\nAside with the structural flaws of the Bitcoin Foundation, there are also other concerns about how the Bitcoin Foundation is handling itself, particularly with regard to its effort to become a more international organization. Some in the Foundation see its efforts at trying to get organizations in other countries to sign on as national chapters as a genuine attempt at diversification, but the opinion in other parts of the world is different; in fact, what many Bitcoin users see is what is essentially an American organization expanding out into the world much like a megacorporation, or even a neo-colonial empire. During the conference in Amsterdam, a group of prominent national Bitcoin leaders discussed the issue in depth, and all agreed on what they saw was an inescapable conclusion: that the Bitcoin Foundation is a hopelessly American-dominated organization that is inherently structurally flawed, and any serious effort to change that reality must start from the outside.\nAnthony Di Iorio is very conscious of both of these concerns. \u201cInternationally,\u201d he says, \u201cone of our goals was to give a blueprint for other countries to start up an organization independently, saying \u2018look at what we\u2019ve done, if you like the way we\u2019ve done it, take our model, and go at it. The people I\u2019ve spoken to here in Europe hadn\u2019t considered the whole option of separating voting and board of directors, and I think that\u2019s key, because the main thing I learned from the foundation was that you can\u2019t just dictate who are are off the bat; you have to get some type of group involvement, some type of callout, and I hope that people in Europe and in other regions take that back and consider it, because with what what I\u2019ve seen with some of them they want to duplicate what the Foundation has done but in Europe, whereas I think you need a global system of representation, and not just a European one.\u201d Ultimately, Di Iorio envisions, a charter for Bitcoin organization should be developed, similar to how Green Party organizations around the world are organized under the Global Greens. \u201cA charter,\u201d Di Iorio writes, \u201ca very loose-fitting international charter that any organization can agree with.\u201d Within Canada itself, Di Iorio points out, there are burgeoning Bitcoin movements in Vancouver and Montreal \u2013 ones that could even be considered larger than that in Toronto. \u201cAs we\u2019re building up the Alliance,\u201d Di Iorio says, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to take into consideration other organizations that are starting up or other people that want to get involved. You can\u2019t dictate, you have to leave room for other strong organizations, and you have to work together.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s Around the Corner\nThe next step for the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada will be the organization\u2019s official public launch next month. During the launch, Di Iorio intends to unveil the organization\u2019s new website, based on the NationBuilder platform popular among political campaigns and community organizations in North America and abroad. Second, and more importantly, the launch will be the time when the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada formally announces its membership structure. Details are still very much open to discussion, but the general consensus is around a tiered membership system, with a free level of membership open to everyone and a paid tier with special privileges such as access to an exclusive forum, voting rights and conference discounts. The free tier too will have its perks, including likely some discount to conferences and an internal forum, although they will not be as impressive as those provided to paying members. \u201cOur goal is to get numbers,\u201d Di Iorio explains. \u201cWhen we are dealing with government regulators or banks we want to be able to represent a large number of people that are involved with digital currencies. We also want people to feel that they can get involved without breaking the bank.\u201d\nAll throughout the organization\u2019s development, transparency has been, and will continue to be, key. The Bitcoin Foundation was announced to the Bitcoin community fully formed, with the full structure already in place. The Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, on the other hand, has taken great care to make every step as open and accessible to public input as possible; here, Di Iorio is literally announcing that the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada is going to be announcing its membership structure. This is all with good reason; by putting out many press releases and explaining what the progress of the Alliance is at every step, Di Iorio hopes that he can avoid the mistakes that he sees in some other Bitcoin organizations and create an organization that all Canadian Bitcoin users can feel is truly theirs.\nFrom there, the organization\u2019s medium-term aims are simple; get more people participating. \u201cWe are volunteer Bitcoin enthusiasts that want to see this succeed,\u2019 Di Iorio explains. \u201cWhether you are a graphic designer or web developer, we are looking for all types of people. We could have ten people in each committee. We have an accountant who is good with non-profits, but we could also have an accountant who is good at something else.\u201d Aside from building up the committees and filling in the various advisory roles, Di Iorio also has a number of specific interests. A particular focus is charities; Bitcoin charities, he believes, are under-represented in Canada given the potential benefit that the charity sector can receive from Bitcoin. \u201cI have a keen interest in charity strategy,\u201d Di Iorio says, \u201cthe best way to advance Bitcoin is to get charities onboard.\u201d Aside from that, Di Iorio would also like to get into closer contact with the various Bitcoin meetup groups around the country, continue to maintain personal contact with organizational Bitcoin leaders, and help ensure that all of Canada is represented in the Alliance. In any of these areas, Di Iorio is always glad to receive help; anyone interested in participating should feel free to email Di Iorio himself at [email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=\"currentScript\"in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\"),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\"cf-hash\"))return t[e]}();if(t&&t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(\"data-cfemail\");if(a){for(e=\"\",r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]> */\nIn terms of the Bitcoin community in Canada as a whole, there are a number of interesting developments in store. There are now an increasing number of Canadian Bitcoin businesses out there; Coinkite, a company coming out with a Bitcoin debit card, merchant terminal and online wallet, is based in Canada, as are the Bitcoin meta-exchange bex.io, the more traditional Bitcoin exchange and now merchant processor CaVirtex and the \u201cBitcoin gift card\u201d seller Cointap. The Canadian Bitcoin community also has its own increasingly popular forum, coinforum.ca. One group that has received a substantial amount of media attention has purchased five Robocoin Bitcoin ATMs and intends to place them in five cities across Canada; the first will soon appear in a coffee shop in Vancouver, followed by another in Toronto.\nAnother city that particularly stands out in the Canadian Bitcoin scene is Montreal. The city was the first in the world to announce a Bitcoin embassy, a 1400-square-meter space that will be used as a central hub for Bitcoin activity in the city. People curious about Bitcoin and merchants interested in accepting it will be able to go there and find help, and Bitcoin developers are already using the space as a workplace. There are plans to create similar embassies in other areas.\nIn Toronto itself, merchant adoption has been slow. Although the local Bitcoin community is certainly growing, with roughly 20-30 people attending every twice-monthly meetup and a record of 60, there are still no grocery stores or restaurants accepting Bitcoin in the city. However, that does not at all mean that the progress is not there. CoWorkingSpace, a large 1400-square-metre workspace where anyone can rent a desk, cubicle or office and work and interact with people from different companies during breaks, has been accepting Bitcoin for six months. There are also many individuals who accept Bitcoin in Toronto, including accountants, lawyers, an army surplus sellers, and plenty of online retailers accept Bitcoin as well; they may not have publicly accessible storefronts that Bitcoin users can point to on a map, but they are part of the Bitcoin community nonetheless.\nAnd even brick and mortar stores and restaurants will soon come as well. CaVirtex, the leading Canadian Bitcoin exchange, has recently unveiled its own BitPay-style merchant services platform and the company has now also hired salespeople with the sole objective of signing up merchants to accept Bitcoin. With a growing startup culture in Toronto and the nearby town of Waterloo, both known for having the two best university computer-science programs in Canada, and the surprisingly strong communities in Montreal and Vancouver, Canada may be well on the path to being a Germany-scale Bitcoin hotspot in its own right.\nSee also: part 2 and part 3 of this series.", "year": 2013, "month": 10, "day": 12}

The country may only have a population of 8 million, but its technological and financial center, Tel Aviv, is home to three Bitcoin-accepting restaurants and a rapidly growing number of startups, and is arguably the birthplace of a Bitcoin technology that has seen a considerable amount of attention in the past few weeks: colored coins. The theoretical background behind the idea was developed with the help of Meni Rosenfeld, an Israeli mathematician who has also been a main organizer of the Israeli Bitcoin community for the last two and a half years. The furthest developed implementation of the project today, Webcoinx, was written mostly by Ukrainian developer Alex Mizrahi, but was funded by eToro, a popular \u201csocial investing\u201d network whose main offices are also located in Tel Aviv.\nIsrael first publicly burst onto the Bitcoin scene in January 2013, when Ron Gross, another organizer of the local Bitcoin meetup group, made a post on the Bitcointalk forums entitled \u201cBitcoin is booming in Israel\u201d. Gross wrote:\nThere\u2019s been a nice Israeli group of Bitcoiners for some time, growing over the last ~ 1.5 years. So far our Meetup has reached about 100 people, with about 15-20 active members. Then, on last Thursday, something happened. Bitcoin was covered on the front page of a major \u201cpopular economics\u201d paper, and then later that day a major TV channel (Channel 10) did a late-night 7 minute story about Bitcoin (featuring, among others, Meir Shitrit, a former minister of finance). Suddenly, we\u2019ve had a boom in Bitcoin interest. Our meetup now contains 145 people (40% increase in 3 days!). Our local forum bitcoin.org.il has seen an influx of new users, as well as our Facebook page. People want to invest, learn, evangelize \u2026 it\u2019s quite awesome!\nTwo weeks later, Gross posted that the latest Israeli Bitcoin meetup had over a hundred people attending \u2013 nearly ten times the amount that it had only two months previously. But the Israeli Bitcoin community\u2019s luck did not stop there. Two months after that, the Israeli Bitcoin meetup in March had over 160 people, and although attention has reduced somewhat since the peak the Israeli Bitcoin community remains one of the most cohesive, and one of the most entrepreneurial, out there; the Israeli Bitcoin community is responsible for colored coins, the instant altcoin exchange Coinpair, the peer-to-peer Bitspend alternative Proxycoins, and many others. Now, the latest development in Israel is the emergence of the Israeli Bitcoin Association, a national Bitcoin group similar in spirit to the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada.\nIn this multipart interview, Meni Rosenfeld and Ron Gross will talk about developments in the Israeli Bitcoin community, their own efforts in organizing community events and meetups, their other Bitcoin-related projects and the vision that they have for the Israeli Bitcoin Association.\n\nVitalik Buterin: First of all, could you introduce yourselves? Who were you before Bitcoin came along, and how did you first get into Bitcoin?\nMeni Rosenfeld: I\u2019m a mathematician, I studied a master\u2019s degree in mathematics, and then I worked for about 2 years for a company called SimilarGroup, which is a startup developing solutions for finding websites and measuring web traffic. I worked there as the head of algorithms research, and then I learned about Bitcoin from a blog post on lesswrong.com, which is a blog about rationality, and they mentioned that the Singularity Institute [now the Machine Intelligence Research Insitute] started accepting Bitcoin donations, so that\u2019s how I first learned about it, and then of course I started looking into what it is exactly. Even while I was still employed full-time I spent a lot of time reading about Bitcoin, participating in the forums, and so on.\nThen I started two projects. First I did some search about mining pool reward methods, so in March 2011 I developed the geometric method, which is the first non-pay-per-share hopping-proof method, and I moved on to develop BGM, which is better, and I wrote an analysis of Bitcoin mining pool reward methods. The other part is that I wanted to develop the situation of Bitcoin in Israel, so in April I started Bitcoil, which was Israel\u2019s first Bitcoin exchange service, and by August of 2011 I realized that Bitcoin has a lot of potential and my business has a lot of potential, so I started to phase out my earlier job at Similar Group. I moved on to a 20% position and focused all my time on Bitcoin-related things, including research, my exchange business, and activity in the community.\nThen, in the beginning of 2013, Bitcoin picked up all over the world, but especially in Israel, so I had a lot more work in the exchange business and in the community. January 2013 was also about the time that Ron joined me as a partner at Bitcoil, and of course before then were together on building the community, organizing meetups and so on. But that\u2019s also when the problems with the banks began to manifest, so after a few months my exchange service wasn\u2019t working anymore, so that became a slow process, but eventually I put that on the backburner. I focused some of my time on doing consultation work to a few companies, right now most notably BitsOfGold and Bitblu, and I spent also a lot of time on activities involving the community in Israel. We recently started establishing the Israeli Bitcoin Association, so we are going to direct a lot of effort into that.\nRon Gross: I\u2019m a software engineer and system architect by profession. I\u2019m a graduate of the Technion university [in Haifa, Israel], and I worked at a few startups, and at Google for half a year, where I learned I don\u2019t want to work at a large company. when I found Bitcoin I was between jobs. In March 2011 I saw a posting on Slashdot of Mike Hearn and BitcoinJ. I saw it was someone from Google, so I was interested; that gave it immediate credibility, and I dug in and saw all the information out there. I immediately understood the big revolution that was going on, I started reading about it and writing on the forums and on my blog, telling everyone I know that they should buy some. Meni and I found each other through Bitcointalk at first-\nMR: Actually, I think the first time I heard about Ron, I didn\u2019t know his name was Ron at the time, was because his father was the second customer of my Bitcoin business, and he told me that he has a son who is into technology, so naturally we got together.\nRG: So yeah, Meni and I started doing meetups here. The first meetup was Meni, myself and some other person, who left about ten minutes afterwards.\nMR: No, he stayed for half an hour to an hour.\nRG: Okay. And the first meetup was three people, the next was ten people, and we saw that these meetups kept attracting more and more people, more diverse people, more influential people, all sorts of people really. In these two years Bitcoin has consumed a lot of my time, and at the beginning of 2013 I finally made a decision to do something beyond the community work and giving presentations \u2013 I decided to join Meni as a partner to Bitcoil, which was the only Israeli exchange at the time as it was before the big explosion of popularity. I wanted to make sure Israelis have an easy way to access Bitcoin and get into the economy and out of the economy as they wish. A few weeks after we made our agreement, the volume started increasing rapidly, as did the attention by customers and by the banks, and as Meni said we couldn\u2019t find a way to continue operating an exchange in Israel, and after a few months of that I decided that this kind of business was maybe not the right kind of business for me, as we\u2019re too much at the mercy of the banks, and I started looking for other opportunities in the space.\nI\u2019ve been following alternative cryptocurrencies for a long time, ever since the first few currencies came up, and I diversified my own portfolio to these currencies whenever I saw an interesting one. There are tons of new currencies; most of them are junk, but a few of them are really innovative. So I have been doing this diversification on my own and I believe that for everyone in Bitcoin today it is better as an investment route to diversify some of their portfolio to these currencies, and so I decided to build a product that simplifies this for the people. And recently a few months ago I started lowering the time I spend in my day job more and more, and maybe one or two months ago I quit, so now I\u2019m fully dedicated to founding Bitblu along with my partner Yuval Bergman, and as Meni said, both of us and a few other people have been founding the Israeli Bitcoin Association and trying to establish a dialogue with the regulators and the banks. One last thing about myself is that I\u2019m also deeply involved with the Mastercoin project; I\u2019m in the board of directors, and I\u2019ve been following the project and supporting it for sometime.\nBuilding Community\nVB: Can we talk more about the meetups?\nMR: The first one was in August 2011, right after the first conference in New York. It was three people, and then we had one every two months. Until maybe October 2012, it was ten to twenty people each time, and in 2013 it started getting bigger. In January, there were about 120 people, and in March it was 160 people. But then because there were so many people it also took a lot of effort to organize it properly, and we didn\u2019t have so much time because we were occupied with other things, so there was a big pause in the meetups. Finally we figured out that the best thing is to reduce their scope so there are more meetups with smaller capacities. In March we had four lectures and two mini-lectures so there was a lot to do. But now, in each meetup we have one lecture, and we are not setting up too many expectations; we are just saying that there will be a lecture at this time.\nWe do it now in the offices of Google; they have a whole floor that is dedicated to having people come and give lectures. Google also gives some refreshments, which is nice, and it\u2019s pretty easy to organize. Before that there was also an issue with trying to find the right place for the meetup each time, but now we don\u2019t worry about it. We just go to Google and that\u2019s it, so we can do such a thing every two weeks. Every time we find a lecturer and a topic, and to these meetups between forty and eighty people come, so given the fact that it\u2019s much more frequent it\u2019s still a big group, and in the future in a few months we will a organize a conference here in Israel for the local community, and some time after that we hope to host a global Bitcoin conference in Israel.\nVB: What kinds of topics are the lectures usually on?\nRG: We have several. We have all kinds of levels of difficulty and familiarity with Bitcoin; the latest one was an introduction to security. Half was basic computer security, and a little bit was about Bitcoin, how to use a wallet and stuff like that. Our technical lecture is going to be about how the blockchain works, that\u2019s the next one, we\u2019re also planning a lecture of about borderless society and what the society will look like when everyone uses Bitcoin.\nVB: Are there many connections between Bitcoin and the local math and cryptography community?\nMR: Of the ties that are now between Bitcoin and the local academia, the most well-known is Adi Shamir, he is the S of RSA), a famous cryptographer who has been interested in Bitcoin for a while, and recently he and Dorit Ron wrote a paper analyzing the Bitcoin transaction graph. In addition we have Eli ben Sasson, who is a professor from the Technion, and he has done some very interesting research about secure computational integrity and privacy, and he also has some very interesting ideas about how to apply this to Bitcoin. In addition we have Aviv Zohar, who is working with Microsoft Research, and he and a few others wrote a paper a year or two ago called \u201cBitcoin and Red Balloons\u201c, where they propose a system to incentivize nodes to propagate transactions, and so they have a system where each node that propagates a transaction gets a cut of the transaction fees collected.\nVB: What are the biggest reasons why people here are interested in Bitcoin?\nRG: There are many really, it\u2019s hard to say which is bigger. I think that maybe the easiest to understand is financial incentive. They hear about it, they see a price chart, they extrapolate, they know where it\u2019s going to be in ten years (or they think they know). Of course, there are those that do the long-term investing, and there are those that buy and sell to make a short-term profit,but in general the financial incentive is there. It\u2019s an interesting market to play at. There are of course the mathematicians and the researchers that come for the complexity of the protocol; there are people interested an an alternative to banks; they know that the current financial system is not stable, and people read about things happening in the United States, in Cyprus, and all around the world, and they\u2019re afraid to keep their money in the banks to some degree.\nMR: Israel is known as a very entrepreneurial country, so people are interested in innovations and trying new things. So once they get past the initial barrier of skepticism about Bitcoin, they are very receptive to this innovation. There are also some other quirks about the Israeli mentality which may make them more receptive to Bitcoin. For example, Israelis really don\u2019t want to be suckers or for people to screw them over, so if they feel that they are suckers because of the way the financial industry and the banks treat them, then they will want an alternative.\nRG: I would rephrase that as: Israelis don\u2019t like being told what to do. And with Bitcoin you don\u2019t have to ask anyone to do what you want to do, so it\u2019s very appealing.\nBitcoin Business\nVitalik Buterin: What about Bitcoin businesses in Israel?\nRon Gross: I think the first wave was just exchanges. Bitcoil was the first Bitcoin company in Israel, and in the past two or three months we had ten exchanges in Israel. Of course, most of them didn\u2019t work out, but this was the first wave.\nMeni Rosenfeld: The first one, Bitcoil, appeared in April 2011 and the next one was about 1.5 years later in October 2012. There was something called Bitcoin Israel, which is run by a mysterious guy in Jerusalem who doesn\u2019t interact much with the community but is doing some good work, and then in 2013 things started to pick up and there were many more. So now we have BitsOfGold and BitGo, the somewhat smaller Bitcoinexchange, and many other wannabes. There is also a local market exchange, Bit2c.\nRG>: So this was maybe the first wave of companies. There are a few other businesses. I think there are companies in Israel that are trying to build ASICs. There is my startup, Bitblu; we\u2019re doing diversification into altcoins and mining bonds in one platform. There is a startup that is not really a Bitcoin startup per se, called AppCoin, run by a big Bitcoin fanatic who went to the early Bitcoin meetups when he had time. In his words, Bitcoin is the answer for decentralized currencies, AppCoin is the answer for centralized currencies. They argue that there are still use cases where it\u2019s better to have centralized currency \u2013 community coins, local coins, and the like, and they currently have a trial with a few of these community coins, and they\u2019re building a platform for people to set up these coins very easily. There is also CoinPair, Proxycoins.\nMR: Maybe we can take a bit of credit for Lamassu. Of course, they are in New Hampshire now, but originally they were from here. Other than that, there is Buy the Way.\nRG: Buy the Way is trying to create a sort of social wallet for Bitcoin. Right now there isn\u2019t really a good wallet for Bitcoin. Each wallet has its own limitations and difficulties. They are trying to create a wallet that is easy to use in social contexts \u2013 either a friend shopping for another friend or other similar use cases.\nMR: there is another thing which isn\u2019t exactly a startup, but it is a Bitcoin initiative which has a lot of support in Israel, which is colored coins. So many of the people who first started to work on it were in Israel, and it gets a lot of support from an Israeli company called eToro, which also itself has some involvement with Bitcoin. It\u2019s a large social investment network, run by Yoni Assia who is a big Bitcoin enthusiast, so they are pushing Bitcoin in general and specifically colored coins, so right now the main developer is Alex Mizrahi from Ukraine, but they also do a lot of support and promotional work, there are some nice promotional videos that they put up, and there is a website, coloredcoins.org, for information.\nRG: One more thing that I want to specify is that one of the founding members of the Bitcoin Association is Eden Shochat, who is a senior VC partner who just founded a new VC fund, called Aleph, and while Aleph has not explicitly said that they are or are not looking for Bitcoin investments, Eden is really interested in the subject and is contributing his time and connections to help us.\nVB: Is the Israeli Bitcoin community mostly in Tel Aviv or elsewhere as well?\nMR: There are people involved in Bitcoin all over the country. Right now, most of the activity happens in Tel Aviv because it\u2019s a big city and it\u2019s pretty central, and most people can get to Tel Aviv. But there are people all over the country, most notably Haifa and Jerusalem, so we also want to do a meetup in Haifa and a meetup in Jerusalem, so people in the north and people in Jerusalem can also come. There are a few Bitcoin users in Jerusalem, and they come to Tel Aviv, but we want to do something exclusive to them.\nRG: I\u2019m originally from the Haifa area, and I\u2019ve been wanting to do a Bitcoin meetup there for a year and a half. I spoke there once at a gathering, they invited me to speak there, but it wasn\u2019t a proper Bitcoin meetup. I just haven\u2019t had time.\nMR: I\u2019m also originally from Haifa.\nVB: What about Bitcoin restaurants?\nMR: There are two bars; there is one place that was the first Bitcoin business to accept Bitcoin in Israel, called the Bar Kayma, which is a bar and vegan restaurant. They are also not an ordinary business, but a cooperative owned collectively by each member. There is another bar, October Bar, nearby, and Galabi \u2013 Anat\u2019s Place, a restaurant.\nRG: And recently just last week I visited a chain of vegan restaurants called Buddha Burgers and I was just asking the owners if they know about Bitcoin. They replied that, yes, they know about it, and lots of people have asked them to accept it. They want to do it; they just need to prioritize among all the different activities that they have, but it\u2019s on their roadmap.\nMR: Another interesting thing, there is a chain of food delivery places and they are working on integrating Bitcoin payments. Some of the details are still confidential, but they have a few hundred merchants working with them, so when they decide to launch it will be significant.\nVB: To wrap up, what do you see in the near future of the Israeli Bitcoin community?\nMR: So far the plan is to get the Israeli Bitcoin Association much more established formally. Right now we have been working on how to define the structure and the way accounting is done, so we want to finish that. Then we can continue to work on our two main agendas. One is the main dialogue with the authorities and the banks to try to find a solution so that the people in Israel who want to do something about Bitcoin, whether they want to buy bitcoins or make a startup, will be able to do that. The other thing is to continue with the education initiatives, have more meetups, lectures, conferences and so on, improve our community further with information and new users, and we are also planning on some other outreach initiatives such as radio ads, promoting Bitcoin as so on, so it will be a lot of work getting people to know about it and do something with it.\nIn the next part of this interview, we will talk about the upcoming pinnacle of Israeli Bitcoin community organization, the Israeli Bitcoin Association.", "year": 2013, "month": 10, "day": 17}
{"title": "Baidu Jiasule and the Chinese Bitcoin Community", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/baidu-jiasule-and-the-chinese-bitcoin-community-1381929357/", "birthday": "Oct 16, 2013  9:15 AM EST", "date": "2013-10-16 14:15:00", "content": "Baidu Jiasule (\u201cBaidu Accelerated\u201d), a Cloudflare-like service offering a website firewall, protection against distributed denial of service attacks and other similar features, has started accepting bitcoins as payment. The Bitcoin payment option is currently manual, with the main site telling its users to contact a phone number if they need to pay with Bitcoin, but this is nevertheless the first instance of a major Chinese site accepting payments in Bitcoin. The news is particularly significant because of the connection to Baidu, a site which is often seen as a Chinese equivalent to Google, offering, among dozens of other less prominent services, a search engine, an encyclopedia and a large collection of music and movies. Baidu Jiasule is only one of the services that Baidu offers, and was only acquired by the company in August, so the reality is somewhat less game-changing than if Baidu as a whole has announced that it was integrating Bitcoin into all of its products, but this is nevertheless significant; Jiasule is a formal subsidiary of Baidu, so it is very improbable that the decision to accept Bitcoin had been made completely unilaterally by the Jiasule team without some kind of approval from its parent company.\nOver the past few months, the Chinese Bitcoin economy has been growing very rapidly. China made its first sudden appearance on the Bitcoin stage in April, when the country became the first to overtake the United States in the number of Bitcoin-Qt software downloads; the country maintains second place on that particular chart to this day. At the same time, the One Foundation, the largest independent charity in China, started accepting Bitcoin donations, and received $30000 in BTC within two days from a combination of a large single donation by leading Chinese Bitcoin exchange BTCChina and many independent contributions. Soon after that, Bitcoin was featured in a half-hour broadcast on Chinese state television, where it was treated in a surprisingly positive light. The Chinese government itself has made absolutely no comments on the legal status of Bitcoin or its regulatory intentions. Attention on Bitcoin in China dwindled somewhat after this initial hype, but the community remained.\nNow, three months after those original events, signs of Bitcoin\u2019s growth in China are evident. There are now no less than ten Chinese Bitcoin exchanges listed on BTCKan.com, a Chinese equivalent of Bitcoincharts, and there are likely even more that are simply too small to be listed. The most prominent one, BTCChina, has almost as much trade volume as MtGox or Bitstamp, with over 20000 BTC sold in the 24 hours before the time of this writing. Of the other Bitcoin exchanges, the leaders include 796 (9300 BTC), OKCoin (7200 BTC) and BTCTrade (5300 BTC). The largest one in volume is BTC100, with over 35000 BTC traded in the past 24 hours \u2013 more than MtGox or BitStamp.\nHowever, these figures do need to be understood in context. The five largest exchanges listed above all either have zero fees or some kind of rebate program, where a large portion of trading fees are returned to customers via some kind of reward point mechanism. BTCChina, OKCoin and BTCTrade have zero fees; BTC100, on the other hand, has a 0.3% fee, but also has a system of \u201cbonus points\u201d, where every 16 BTC traded on the exchange entitles the user to receive one \u201cbonus point\u201d, which is functionally similar to a stock except without formal ownership or voting rights. Similar to Bitcoin\u2019s exponentially decreasing currency issuing model, the number of bonus points awarded will go down over time, leveling off at at a maximum of one million. The one million bonus points together entitle their holders to 30% of BTC100\u2019s revenues, and the bonus points themselves can also be traded at no fee on the exchange.\nCurrently, each bonus point goes for about 0.0244 BTC, giving BTC100 a total market capitalization of 0.0244 * 1000000 / 0.3 = 81300 BTC, or $11.8 million USD. If one sells all of one\u2019s bonus points immediately upon receiving them, this amounts to a rebate of 0.15%, bringing BTC100\u2019s de-facto fee to a low 0.15%. The third highest-volume exchange, 796, has a similar program. Such low fees are ideal for high volumes of speculation and day-trading, so the actual level of interest in Bitcoin in China is somewhat less than these artificially inflated figures imply \u2013 although China is certainly nevertheless a force to be reckoned with.\nWhy Bitcoin?\nWhy do so many Chinese people care about Bitcoin? First of all, in some metaphorical sense, virtual currency is in Chinese internet users\u2019 blood. Tencent QQ, a Chinese company which can perhaps be most closely identified with the American Yahoo (or at least as Yahoo was in its heyday in the early 2000s), released a virtual currency called Q Coin in 2007; Q Coin became extremely popular in all sort of online applications including social media and e-commerce, but was eventually neutered by the Chinese government. As far as its user experience goes, Bitcoin, being a digital currency, is very similar to Q Coin, so Bitcoin comes naturally to Chinese users in a way that it simply does not to many people in Europe or North America.\nBut as far as actual uses are concerned, the culture in China is rather different from that in Europe or the United States. The most obvious proof of this is the difference in the two countries\u2019 reactions to Silk Road. When the Silk Road went down at the beginning of this month, the Bitcoin price on nearly all English-language exchanges went down fast. MtGox sank from $140 to a low of $110, Bitstamp from $127 to $85 and BTC-E from $123 to $75. BTCChina, on the other hand, hardly budged, sinking from $770 to $680. \u201cMost Chinese Bitcoiners believe that Silk Road going down is a good sign in the long run,\u201d Chinese Bitcoin user Red Li explains. Drugs are unpopular in Asia in general; cannabis, cocaine and ecstasy show universally low usage in east and southeast Asia compared to the Americas and Europe, although amphetamines and opiates are more ambiguous, and all drugs with the obvious exception of alcohol are much more frowned upon by both governments, with many countries having a death penalty for serious or even moderate cases of drug trafficking on the books, and society in general. That is not to say that Bitcoin is all about drugs in Europe and the United States; in fact, it actually shows that Bitcoin has strong merits without any connection to illegal substances, or the idealistic motivations behind anonymous crypto-markets, whatsoever, and it is precisely the other applications of Bitcoin that the Chinese Bitcoin community is focused on.\nRather than ideological motivations, the main driver for Bitcoin use in China is much more mundane: the search for profit. A large portion of Bitcoin mining hardware development takes place in China, and a number of major ASIC companies, including ASICMiner, Avalon reseller Asicme, TMR and BTCGarden are located there. Additionally, Red writes, \u201cChinese people may treat [Bitcoin] as an speculation tool.\u201d Red himself originally got into Bitcoin for this reason, although his role in the Bitcoin community has now grown beyond just that. \u201cBut when I dug into the whole cryptocurrency thing,\u201d Red writes, \u201c[I saw it was] a brilliant idea and probably the most innovative invention. Then I realized that to protect and preserve the value of BTC applications must be developed. Right now, what I am doing is spreading the knowledge about BTC so that peoplecan accept it. Merchants will not take the risk unless their customers ask for it. That\u2019s basically how I changed my mind; speculator into promoter?\u201d\nThe path that Red has followed in many ways mirrors that of the Chinese Bitcoin community as a whole; over the past few months, a disparate group of internet users interested in profiting from the speculative potential that Bitcoin and mining have to offer have started to put together the trappings of a genuine Bitcoin community, with regular meetups in a particular coffee shop in Beijing (as well as events in other cities), community news websites and forums. The first merchant accepting Bitcoin was the online store IWannaBuy, which accepted Bitcoin since April, and getting more and especially more mainstream Chinese merchants to start accepting Bitcoin is a major community priority. With that in mind, Baidu Jiasule may be the Chinese community\u2019s first major success.\nWhat can Bitcoin do in China aside from serving as a medium of speculation? The possibilities are plentiful; \u201ce-commerce, crowdfunding, getting rid of bankers,\u201d Red Li writes, to name a few. Charity is currently not particularly popular in China, but this may change in the future; environmentalism, for a long timea luxury of the west, is making massive inroads on all levels of society as people get wealthier, so the same thing may happen to charity as well. If that happens, Bitcoin may be an excellent tool for charities to get funding, if the success of Sean\u2019s Outpost is any indication. And even if Bitcoin\u2019s main role will be as an object of speculation, there is nothing wrong with that; the Chinese government currently has the sixth largest gold reserves in the world, so if Bitcoin becomes a replacement to gold for this function the potential upside for Bitcoin is massive. The Asian Bitcoin community as a whole, including China, Singapore and perhaps one can even include Australia, is expected to make its first major public appearance at the Bitcoinvention, a conference in the Philippines in February 2014. Until then, the Chinese Bitcoin story may yet have a long way to unfold in the coming months.", "year": 2013, "month": 10, "day": 16}

As it happens,Jay Postma, co-author of the subject presentation is an individual member of the Foundation. Moreover, as mentioned, his co-presenter, Scott Apodaca is a representative of Western Union.\nHowever, the comingling of old and new should come to no surprise to those that have been following Roger Ver the \u201cBitcoin Jesus,\u201d Jon Matonis, Executive Director of the Bitcoin Foundation and the open nature of the Bitcoin Foundation in general.\nEarlier this month Ver posted a popular photo on Twitter of the Director of Products for Western Union wearing a Bitcoin button in front of the BitPay booth at the Money2020Emerging Payments & Financial Services conference. Western Union was founded in 1851.\nEarlier this year, Jon Matonis was invited to talk atSWIFTor the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, the \u201cglobal provider of secure financial messaging services.\u201d\nJohn described the experience in his Forbes article \u201cBitcoin Comes To SWIFT:\u201d\n\u201cThe undeniable march of Bitcoin definitely left an impression on SWIFT, however Bitcoin as a network is an existential threat.

Maybe they just need to mingle more?\nStefan Molyneux, host of the Freedomain Radio recently had a fantastic Youtube video \u201cThe Truth About Bitcoin\u201d and explained (at 4 minutes 40 seconds) how \u201cRecently, someone transferred 6.5m in BTC for a fee of 6 cents (0.0000009% fee)\u201d and further compared what those fees would be using legacy financial institutions. However, he didn\u2019t include a comparison to Western Union. Western Union doesn\u2019t appear to make its fees for transfers of more than $2,000 transparent on its website. In any case, it cost about $8 or .8% (less than one percent) to send $1,000 to Argentina from New York City for \u201cmoney in minutes transfer\u201d and it also costs $8 for a 3 day transfer and $68 or 6.8% for a similar \u201cmoney in minutes\u201d transfer to Cyprus. I tried to use the same link to move the money in reverse but it appears that there is only an option (at least on the web) to move money from Canada and the United states to another destination. To be fair I haven\u2019t done an in depth analysis of Western Union\u2019s services (and haven\u2019t personally used their services).\nYet there is nary a mention of Bitcoin in the World Bank Website\u2026 well there are some comments left at CGAP or the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor. CGAP is \u201choused\u201d at the World Bank and apparently the World Bank scrapes their website for inclusion in their search engine. CGAP works toward a \u201cworld in which everyone has access to the financial services they need to improve their lives.\u201d One comment apparently left by an employee of Coinlab last August under a post on \u201cWhat Do International Remittances Mean for Mobile Money?:\u201d\n\u201cI am curious what you think about Bitcoin for international remittances. It seems like it gets around some of the barriers listed above. Bitcoin is less exposed to regulatory hurdles because there is no individual centralized entity which controls it. Operationally, it is a breeze compared to starting an international money transfer business: anyone with an internet connection can start using the protocol to transfer value from anywhere to anywhere in the world in minutes for free.

We have no official connection to the protocol, we are just building services off of it\u2026\u201d\nOh, and there is Michael Klein\u2019s paper at the World Bank earlier this year, \u201cThe Next 30 Years: What future for finance?\u201d where he stated that \u201cVolatility and disarray\u2026paved the way for disruptive business models in finance\u201d where \u201cEncrypted, distributed peer-to-peer networks such as the old Bitcoin of 2009 provided real alternatives\u2026\u201d and snarkily added:\n\u201cIn 2037 the annual Nakamoto conference in honor of the pseudonymous inventor of bitcoin honored the 90th birthday of Ian Angell Professor Emeritus of the London School of Economics. Ian\u2019s vision of a future with private \u201coff-planet banking\u201d at last seems to become reality\u2026\u201d\nMichael Klein worked at the World Bank for more than twenty-five years, most recently as Vice President for Financial and Private Sector Development for the World Bank Group as well as Chief Economist, International Finance Corporation and apparently is still a blogger for the Bank.\nWestern Union Flirting with Bitcoin\nBack in April the was an article from Fox Business News (that has curiously disappeared) entitled \u201cBitcoin Buzz Draws Western Union and MoneyGram.\u201d As always, Reddit was there and Reddit user Cowboy_Coder had the following comment which received the most votes:\n\u201cIf they move early, Western Union could establish themselves as the defacto method of exchanging cash to and from bitcoins, all around the world.\nIf they hesitate and wait too long, they will find themselves irrelevant and obsolete. Make the smart decision WU.\u201d\nMichael Terpin co-founder of BitAngels recently had a guest post on VentureBeat \u201cBitcoin\u2019s road from perdition: What will hurt and help the controversial digital currency:\u201d\n\u201cA fully licensed, established money transmitter adopting Bitcoin: Be it eBay\u2019s PayPal (oh, the irony), Western Union or Moneygram (who briefly worked with ZipZap and, by extension, BitInstant), a fully licensed mainstream transmitter with a track record of compliance in both AML (anti money laundering) and KYC (know your customer) regulations would undoubtedly lead to a new wave of usage among heretofore tenuous early adopters, both on the consumer and merchant side.\u201d\nDoing the Dance\nIt is fascinating watching legacy banking and Bitcoiners do this dance. Right now each partner is learning the next move from one another. Neither have the lead in this dance. We have a lot to learn from one one another during these exciting times.

Despu\u00e9s de tanto leer decid\u00ed hacer una compra para probar, fue alrededor de 0.25btc. El inicio de la plataforma fue en noviembre del a\u00f1o pasado, hab\u00eda comprado ya algunas monedas y con el boom, decid\u00ed venderlas y comenzar un negocio relacionado al bitcoin.\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 le aconsejar\u00edas a otros inversores que buscan una empresa que pueda apoyarlos relacionadas al Bitcoin?\nQue investiguen bien el producto en el que van a invertir. Que se aseguren que la compa\u00f1\u00eda/producto marque una diferencia, y no sea tan solo un medio de env\u00edo o cambio de moneda. La plataforma MT Gox quebr\u00f3 y la mayor\u00eda de empresas nuevas se pelean por reemplazarla, pero nadie esta haciendo lo que nosotros estamos tratando de hacer, que es, colocar el Bitcoin como uso diario.\nEstamos tratando de integrar el Bitcoin a nuestro sistema financiero actual y marcar la diferencia.\nB\u00e1sicamente, que los usuarios se beneficien con el Bitcoin y que no solo sean seguidores, sino tambi\u00e9n clientes.\n\u00bfRecomiendas a los inversionistas del Bitcoin se enfoquen sus esfuerzos fuera de los Estados Unidos?

{"title": "How to decentralise the Bitcoin Foundation", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/how-to-decentralise-the-bitcoin-foundation-1382478074/", "birthday": "Oct 22, 2013  5:41 PM EST", "date": "2013-10-22 22:41:00", "content": "At the first evening of the Bitcoin conference in Amsterdam, about 20 Bitcoiners from Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Hungary, Israel, the Netherlands and the UK gathered around a dimly lit table in the first floor of a caf\u00e9 near the conference venue to discuss the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s efforts to start \u201cnational chapters\u201c. There had been some irrititation about the Foundation\u2019s plans and not everybody was happy with the way they were executed.\nSo it became obvious that a meeting of the founders of national Bitcoin associations would make sense. Having met many people from many countries at international Bitcoin conferences this year (in San Jos\u00e9, London and New York) and being involved in setting up a German association, I initiated the meeting and started a Google group to keep the conversation going.\nSome of these associations \u2013 or associations-to-be \u2013 were among the \u201cchosen ones\u201c which had received drafts for so-called affiliation contracts by the Bitcoin Foundation. These contract drafts were generally perceived as \u201cone-sided\u201c and \u201ctop-down\u201c. Some international association founders were so upset by them that they questioned whether to cooperate with the US based Foundation at all.\nI was a bit suprised by this, as in a meeting in Berlin with the Foundation\u2019s executive director Jon Matonis, my impression was that Jon prefers a truly decentralised model. He described his plan to set up an umbrella organisation based outside the US with the newly founded local associations as its members, and to me it seemed that he really wanted to change the current US-centric structure of the Foundation in order to reflect the global, decentralized nature of Bitcoin.\nA lot of criticism towards the US Foundation stems from its mixed nature: it has members from all over the world, but it is registered under US law and all board members are US citizens. Some people have the impression that international member fees and donations are spent on US lawyers to solve US problems. Jon was aware of this and I understood that the board had agreed to re-invent the Foundation.\nYet nothing of this was expressed in those drafts, which reminded some of McDonalds franchisee contracts. I don\u2019t know why and how this happened. But in my opinion, it is not the point whether the conditions how to divide member fees and donations described in these affiliate contracts are fair or not. I don\u2019t think a contract between the US Foundation and any association in another country is needed at all. There is no reason for the US Foundation to play a special role; it should be one member of a global \u201cFederation of Bitcoin Associations\u201c, without any special privileges or \u201csuperpowers\u201c. Such a global federation would need some slim by-laws to define its purpose and structure, but nothing more.\nSome people in the meeting questioned whether we need a global organisation at all. They argued that although Bitcoin is a global phenomenon, the job to educate regulation authorities and politicians about Bitcoin needs to be done on the local and national level. Most participants in the meeting, however, believe that being part of a global network does provide everyone with a better standing in talks with local politicans and media \u2013 just like Greenpeace usually has a far stronger impact than a local environmental group.\nWhen we had to leave the Amsterdam caf\u00e9 (as they wanted to open their dancefloor which we had occupied), the general mood was very positive and optimistic. It was a pleasure to see many people for the first time and to find out that we all have very similar views on how to work together. Our overall consensus was that we do want to cooperate with the US Foundation, and that we do think that some global organisation makes sense, but a global \u201cBitcoin Federation\u201c (or \u201cBitcoin Alliance\u201c, as the Star Wars fans prefer) should be built not from the top down, but rather from the bottom up. It should be as decentralised as possible, without a strong headquarter, rather a loose network of local nodes that enables its members to exchange ideas and experiences and to join forces when necessary.\nA truly global Bitcoin Federation should follow the good old principle to \u201cthink globally, act locally\u201c.", "year": 2013, "month": 10, "day": 22}

Here, we talk about the next stage in the Israeli Bitcoin community\u2019s growth: the effort to set up an Israeli Bitcoin Association. National Bitcoin organizations have been a popular subject lately, with the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada soon to announce its official launch and similar organizations in other countries now picking up worldwide. But what is the benefit of having a national Bitcoin organization, and what would such an organization do? At least for the case of Israel, Rosenfeld and Gross explain below.\nVitalik Buterin: So what as the original idea behind the Israeli Bitcoin Foundation-\nRon Gross: Association.\nMeni Rosenfeld: We went with \u201cfoundation\u201d previously, but now we usually use \u201cassociation\u201d; first, it\u2019s a more accurate translation for the name which it has in Hebrew, and second we originally started to work as part of the global Bitcoin Foundation in the US, but right now it doesn\u2019t look so good about our cooperation with them, because they have some very problematic terms for the partnership.\nRG: I would say it\u2019s their approach.\nVB: But before we get into that, what was the original idea behind the Israeli Bitcoin Association?\nRG: Well, the original idea that still holds is very simple: Israel today has a lot of issues around Bitcoin banking. It\u2019s very difficult or impossible for Bitcoin businesses to open bank accounts. It\u2019s hard for private people to deal with Bitcoin. Even wiring money within Israel from one person to another, if the word Bitcoin is on the transaction, a lot of banks will refuse the transaction. If they try to wire money abroad, it\u2019s very difficult for people and companies to work with Bitcoin. There hasn\u2019t been a lot of clear communication from regulators compared to other regulators in the US and Europe. So I think our first goal is to establish lines of communication between the community, businesses, the banks and the regulators, just try to get everyone to talk. The end goal is not just to try to get everyone to talk, but also to establish some sort of regulation that would allow businesses and people to work with Bitcoin.\nMR: That\u2019s one part of the vision for the association; the other part is to work on education and outreach, getting as many people as possible to know about Bitcoin and to know accurate information about Bitcoin, so that\u2019s a continuation of what we\u2019ve been doing all along with texts we wrote, information websites and so on. So we want to do that, but on a much larger scale.\nVB: what are some of these texts?\nMR: There is the website bitcoin.org.il. The vision was to run it as a community website; in practice it\u2019s a content website where mostly Ron and I write articles on a few Bitcoin topics, usually how to use it and why we need Bitcoin ,what does it mean and so on. We want to be the go-to site whenever someone hears about Bitcoin and wants to learn more. Lately this site was a bit neglected, but we do plan to gather more manpower and develop it to be a more complete resource.\nRG: This website, bitcoin.org.il, is the homepage of the Bitcoin community. From it, you can reach all the other relevant websites: we have a Facebook page, a Facebook group, a Meetup group, a wiki, an IRC channel, a Google group, so a lot of ways to communicate. Meni also moderates the Hebrew section of Bitcointalk. The meetups have been recorded and uploaded to Youtube. The meetups are for the general public, but we\u2019re also having some private meetings with institutions, regulators and banks, just trying to get the information out there. Those are the types of people that don\u2019t usually come to meetups. So we usually go to one of them and share the information.\nMR: There are also more public lectures. People invite us to lecture at universities, companies, etc.\nRG: an amusing anecdote that I\u2019ll share with Meni\u2019s permission is that he was once invited to a bachelor party to talk about Bitcoin.\nMR: so apparently you don\u2019t have strippers in bachelor parties anymore, you have Bitcoin lecturers. And they paid me.\nVB: In Bitcoin?\nMR: Yeah, I think it was Bitcoin.\nIsrael and the Bitcoin Foundation\nNote: Those interested in seeing other views on the subject of the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s international chapters are encouraged to also read Jon Matonis\u2019s clarifications here:\nhttp://bitcoinmagazine.com/7605/internationality-democracy-and-reforming-the-bitcoin-foundation/\nAnd an op-ed by Aaron Koenig, organizer of the below mentioned discussions in Amsterdam, here:\nhttp://bitcoinmagazine.com/7637/how-to-decentralise-the-bitcoin-foundation/\nVB: Next, to that other point you raised earlier, which is, what were the aspects of the Foundation\u2019s approach that you found so problematic?\nRG: So we started talking about forming the Israeli Bitcoin Foundation, as we called it, and the vision was always to be a chapter of the Global Foundation, even before they came out and publicly announced that there was a chapter program. We needed an organization for Israel, and we wanted to cooperate with the Foundation. We approached the Foundation and started a dialogue, and we were then selected as one of the five countries to work with the alpha program for the chapters; we discussed this locally, and then we started getting the terms from them. So first we got the more general terms in an email, and then we got the official contract that they proposed. Basically, they proposed a sort of a revenue sharing model, where they will collect all of the member fees and the donations and within a certain period, maybe on month, they will transfer a half of that \u2013 a half of the member fees and a half of the donations \u2013 to us. And we won\u2019t have any option of accepting either of these on our own.\nAt first, we were basically alone with them. We didn\u2019t know who the other groups were; we were discussing this internally, trying to understand, is this acceptable or not? We sort of reached an agreement that maybe we\u2019ll do a 50% share of the member fees, maybe, but the donations I think were a no-go. We needed to maintain a way for anyone who wanted to donate to the Israeli association to do it without having half of the donation taken away. We started reaching out and finding other similar organizations in other countries. We tried to reach most or all of the pilot programs and a few other organizations that weren\u2019t in the pilot program.\nWe just had a few meetings in Amsterdam, and they were all in the same situation as us. They received the same kinds of conditions, sort of a dictated proposal from above without an open dialogue, and we reached a conclusion. None of us, none of the people in that room want to just accept these kinds of conditions written in a top-down fashion by the Foundation that is effectively today a US foundation. Nobody appointed them to be the world foundation, and in the latest election even though one or more of the candidates were foreign those candidates weren\u2019t elected. The foundation is de-facto a US entity. So all of us decided that we don\u2019t want this kind of cooperation with them, and we are not sure what we are getting in exchange for all these fees that will be sent outwards.\nWe actually talked about creating something else, and we are still discussing what that something else will be. The general direction right now would be for each country, and each section or area to establish their own organization, and for these organizations to have some loose ties with some kind of umbrella organization but without necessarily any formal structure, voting or fees because we tried to think, if we had a sort of global Bitcoin organization, what sort of decisions would this organization do, and we didn\u2019t find any decisions that this organization would do. It\u2019s not authorized to make changes to the Bitcoin protocol, as that is not how the Bitcoin protocol works, and regarding regulation, that is specific by country or by region. We are still discussing the details of this.\nMR: The general idea is to build the structure gradually and naturally. We can start with each country building their own association, and of course share information, tips and whatever and cooperate if possible, and from there we see what kind of structure makes sense for the organization and go with that, and maybe in the future we will have something more formal if we need it. One thing that I am told is that when working with regulators you have much more power if you are part of a bigger global movement, so if there\u2019s benefit in creating such a formal global organization, then we\u2019ll do it, but we don\u2019t have to do it right now.\nRG: I have to add on this, in our communications with the Bitcoin Foundation, they have been communicating with us, mostly via email (I haven\u2019t had a Skype call with them for a long time), but we got a sort of mixed message. We got a message from them that they are actually setting up a new umbrella organization that the Bitcoin Foundation will be a member of. We interpreted this as a positive signal that they are actually trying to do the right thing, but then we learned in Amsterdam that this is not actually the case.\nThey are setting up a new organization registered in the UK. They haven\u2019t discussed this with anyone in the UK organization, they just ended up doing it in their own, and they intend for the board of directors of the new organization to be the exact same board that they currently have in the Bitcoin Foundation. So it\u2019s more like outsourcing their management not to get sued by the US; I don\u2019t know the motivation, but this is not the type of global organization we want to build.\nVB: I was [talking to Anthony] of the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, and one idea he had was to have a sort of global organization based on something like the global Green Party movement. Or another example might be the global Pirate Party movement as well. So it would be a loose charter that any organization would abide by, but otherwise it\u2019s just informal cooperation.\nRG: We have a Google Group right now where we\u2019re discussing these issues. We are of course open to working with the Bitcoin Foundation; we want to include them, we don\u2019t want to fight anyone else. But we want to treat them as equal members in the global organization,and this is apparently not how they see things.\nAfter the conference we broke up for a bit, everyone is trying to get the opinion of their local organization. We also have a meeting with our board where we update the board on what happened in Amsterdam and try to get a clear message from the Israeli organization. We haven\u2019t had the chance to update everyone. A lot of organizations are in the same kind of state. It will take a few weeks or a few months, but we will get something going.", "year": 2013, "month": 10, "day": 23}

Although there are now dozens of alternative implementations on the market, libbitcoin is one of the few that re-implements the complete Bitcoin standard, allowing users to run a deterministic wallet, an elliptic curve message signing interface and, of course, a fully functional Bitcoin node. Even multisignature transactions, which many popular wallets including blockchain.info and Bitcoin Wallet for Android still do not support, libbitcoin handles just fine. Libbitcoin is also unique in its modularity; the package itself is a software library, containing a set of components each of which can be programmatically called individually, avoiding the need to start up a fully fledged, monolithic software daemon just to make a few simple transactions or queries. If you want a full client running locally, you can use libbitcoin to do that, but you can also just as easily only use libbitcoin for transaction management and networking and rely on other nodes for transaction data. Whatever you need, you use, and whatever you don\u2019t need you simply don\u2019t bother with.\nAs the first major practical application of libbitcoin, Amir Taaki has recently released sx, a set of command line utilities for working with Bitcoin keys and transactions. The basic intent is simple: empower Bitcoin users who are somewhat technically skilled, but not experienced programmers, to interact with Bitcoin not just as an interface where they type in an amount and a destination address and bitcoind does everything for them, but also work directly with the underlying building blocks. Every sx tool follows the Unix philosophy: it does one thing, and it does it well. genaddr takes an Electrum wallet seed or master public key and an index and returns an address. mktx creates unsigned transactions, and sign-input signs transaction inputs. history returns a list of unspent transactions associated with a Bitcoin address that can be used as inputs \u2013 and so on.\nThese tools can be accessed on the command line to construct Bitcoin transactions one step at a time, or one can call them programatically (eg. with os.popen(command).read() in Python) to create Bitcoin software like merchant packages and wallets. Up until now, creating a new Bitcoin wallet was difficult \u2013 one would need to either re-implement everything from scratch, take an existing wallet and work hard to untangle the code to separate out the transaction logic from the wallet logic, or rely on a bitcoind node running in the background. With libbitcoin and sx, however, the tools to work with Bitcoin transactions on the lowest level are already there \u2013 freeing developers to work on the problems that truly need the most work \u2013 like optimizing security and the user experience.\nMore Than Just A Library\nSo why do libbitcoin and SX matter? As it turns out, the answer goes far beyond the simple fact that they\u2019re convenient. One of the main problems with the Bitcoin ecosystem is that although Bitcoin is nominally decentralized, in reality the miners that keep the network running are all running the same piece of core Bitcoin software: bitcoind. Bitcoind is the \u201cheadless\u201d (ie. command line only) version of the original Bitcoin client that has been developed ever since Satoshi released the first version in 2009, and serves as the software that all miners and nearly all businesses use to communicate with the Bitcoin network.\nThis is unhealthy for two reasons. First, having a monopoly can potentially lead to highly disruptive blockchain forks; for example, in March this year the removal of a database bug preventing bitcoind nodes from processing a block simultaneously affecting the status of more than 5,000 transactions caused the Bitcoin network to split in half for about six hours as nodes with the bug and without the bug disagreed on the validity of a block and started working on two separate blockchains. The fix: the Bitcoin community came together and agreed to shut down the version 0.8 nodes, and added the database bug to the official protocol for two months until it could be removed in a controlled way two months later. If there were instead five different Bitcoin implementations in active and widespread use, the failure of any one would only affect a small portion of the Bitcoin network \u2013 and ordinary users\u2019 clients, which typically only verify transactions and not blocks, would probably not be affected at all as, in the event of a fork, the \u201clegitimate\u201d blockchain would nearly always be the one commanding a majority of the network.\nThe second reason is political. Many core bitcoind developers, particularly lead developer Gavin Andresen, are also part of the Bitcoin Foundation, an organization which has taken clear steps toward using political lobbying as a strategy for protecting Bitcoin. The fear is that, in the future, the government might try to regulate Bitcoin more, and give the foundation an ultimatum: you include certain privacy-eroding features (a moderate example might be an \u201caddress validation fee\u201d to discourage people from covering their tracks by creating many Bitcoin addresses) in the protocol, or we ban Bitcoin exchanges. The Foundation may well comply, and the US government knows it. If the Foundation did not have the power to make these kinds of changes to the protocol without widespread international consent, however, then the US government would not have this option \u2013 they would be forced to either try banning Bitcoin outright, at the cost of massive goodwill among the tech and open-source community at the very least, or let it be and focus on softer regulatory strategies. This is why Bitcoin advocates like Amir Taaki, Joerg Platzer and others have long supported diversifying and internationalizing the Bitcoin ecosystem. And libbitcoin just might be the catalyst that finally sets the process going.\nHow do you use SX?\nInstalling sx is very simple if you\u2019re on Linux; on the command line, wget http://sx.dyne.org/install-sx.sh followed by sudo bash ./install-sx.sh is all it takes. If you\u2019re on Windows or Mac, things are somewhat more complicated, although not more so than any other similar software package; the source code is available for download at https://github.com/genjix/sx, and from there you can install it manually.\nOnce sx is installed, here are some of the things you can do with it. First, the basic address and key manipulations.\nGenerate a private key/public key/address triple:\nsx newkey > pk1cat pk1 | sx pubkey > pub1cat pk1 | sx addr > addr1cat pk1 pub1 addr1\n\nGenerate private key/address pairs from an Electrum wallet:\nsx newseed > seedfor x in `seq 0 9`; do cat seed | sx genpriv $x; cat seed | sx genaddr $x; done\n\nGenerate just the addresses from a master public key:\ncat seed | sx mpk > mpkfor x in `seq 0 9`; do cat mpk | sx genaddr $x; done\n\nTransactions\nNow, it\u2019s time to get into transactions. First, a little understanding is needed as to how transactions work. Bitcoin does not have the concept of \u201caccounts\u201d; instead, a transaction spending money from an address must directly reference some transactions sending at least an equal amount of money to that address; these are usually called \u201cprevious transaction outputs\u201d. For example, if you have an address to which you sent 2 BTC, 3 BTC and then 4 BTC and want to spend 5 BTC, you are not spending 5 BTC out of that address; rather, you are spending the 2 BTC and 3 BTC transaction outputs. Additionally, an output cannot be \u201cpartially spent\u201d; even if you only want to send 0.1 BTC, you must consume an entire output. You can avoid wasting 1.9 BTC by adding a special output to the transaction, called \u201cchange\u201d, where you send the remaining funds back to yourself.\nThe basic command that you will use to get these unspent transaction outputs is sx history:\nsx history `cat addr1`\n\nHowever, this by itself returns all transactions connected to that address, not just the ones we want, so we need to filter the output a bit. This is a complicated script; basically, it first looks for the word \u201cUnspent\u201d in the history and gets those lines plus the transaction data in the two lines above them. Then, it uses grep and awk to extract just the data that we need. Note that the command returns values in satoshis; 100 million satoshis equal 1 BTC. Send 0.001 BTC to the address contained in the addr1 file (cat addr1 to see it, and sx qrcode `cat addr1` qrcode.png to generate a scannable QR code), and run the following command:\nsx history `cat addr1` | grep Unspent -B 2 | grep output | awk '{print $2}' > inputcat input\n\nNow that we have the history, let\u2019s use sx to create and send a transaction.\nsx mktx txfile.tx `cat input` -o 18qk7SqRHuS4Kf3f6dmsvqqv7iw1xy77Z6:90000sx rawscript dup hash160 [ `cat addr1 | sx decode-addr` ] equalverify checksig > raw.scriptcat pk1 | sx sign-input txfile.tx 0 `cat raw.script` > sigsx rawscript [ `cat sig` ] [ `cat pub1` ] | sx set-input txfile.tx 0 > txfile2.tx; mv txfile2.tx txfile.txsx broadcast-tx txfile.tx\n\nHere\u2019s what to do if you have multiple transaction inputs you want to spend. Send 0.0002 BTC to your address five times, and run the above sx history command again and make sure that it returns five outputs. To avoid having to copy and paste five transaction inputs by hand, we\u2019ll do a little more command line magic:\nsx history `cat addr1` | grep Unspent -B 2 | grep output | awk '{print $2}' > temp1cat temp1 | sed 's/^/-i /' | tr '\\n' ' ' > temp2cat temp2\n\nNotice how temp2 contains all the inputs in exactly the right format for sx mktx. Now, we just splice them in:\nsx mktx txfile.tx `cat temp2` -o 18qk7SqRHuS4Kf3f6dmsvqqv7iw1xy77Z6:90000sx rawscript dup hash160 [ `cat addr1 | sx decode-addr` ] equalverify checksig > raw.scriptfor x in `seq 0 4`; do cat pk1 | sx sign-input txfile.tx $x `cat raw.script` > sig$x; donefor x in `seq 0 4`; do sx rawscript [ `cat sig$x` ] [ `cat pub1` ] | sx set-input txfile.tx $x > txfile2.tx; mv txfile2.tx txfile.tx; donesx broadcast-tx txfile.tx,\nThe Holy Grail: Multisignature Transactions\nFirst we\u2019ll generate 3 sets of private keys, pubkeys and addresses.\nfor x in `seq 1 3`; do sx newkey > pk$x; donefor x in `seq 1 3`; do cat pk$x | sx pubkey > pub$x; donefor x in `seq 1 3`; do cat pk$x | sx addr > addr$x; done\n\nThen, we\u2019ll create the multisig address.\nsx rawscript 2 [ `cat pub1` ] [ `cat pub2` ] [ `cat pub3` ] 3 checkmultisig > msig.scriptcat msig.script | sx showscriptcat msig.script | sx scripthash > 3addrcat 3addr\n\nSend 0.001 BTC to the address (doesn\u2019t work with all wallets!) and then run the following to get the transaction hash:\nsx history `cat 3addr` | grep Unspent -B 2 | grep output | awk '{print $2}' > inputcat input\n\nNow, we need to construct the transaction and sign it, in this case using the first and third private keys (first and second or second and third work equally well). We\u2019ll send only 50000 satoshis, leaving 0.0005 BTC as a fee.\nsx mktx txfile.tx -i `cat input` -o 18qk7SqRHuS4Kf3f6dmsvqqv7iw1xy77Z6:50000cat pk1 | sx sign-input txfile.tx 0 `cat msig.script` > sig1cat pk3 | sx sign-input txfile.tx 0 `cat msig.script` > sig3sx rawscript zero [ `cat sig1` ] [ `cat sig3` ] [ `cat msig.script` ] > input.scriptcat input.script | sx set-input txfile.tx 0\n\nAnd, finally, broadcast the transaction.\nsx broadcast-tx txfile.tx\n\nFairly complicated, but multisignature transactions are not exactly simple in any case. With sx, however, the complexity is reduced to a series of steps that you can simply follow, or even incorporate into your own programs to run whenever you need to. Whether you\u2019re a command line enthusiast, a Bitcoin developer or just someone interested in looking more deeply into how Bitcoin transactions work, sx is the tool for you.

The market has been dominated up to now by three different operators \u2013 Microwallet.org, Coinbox.me and BitChest.me \u2013 which for years have steadily churned out bitcoins to thousands of bitcoin users. However, in recent weeks Bitchest stopped dispensing, and their bitcoin wallet address has gone quiet. Now in the last few days, Microwallet.org put up a notice that there was a bug with the Blockchain.info API, and was offline yesterday, but back up again today with a notice saying that withdrawals will be processed in the next 24 hours. So can these issues be overcome, or is writing on the wall for these sites?\nI have been looking into faucets for the last few weeks for some personal research, and have several accounts on these sites over the threshold. I can confirm that two of the three, MicroWallet and BitChest, indeed have stopped dispensing.\nDismissed by many for the tiny amounts of bitcoin they give to end users, these faucets still have served an important entry gateway into bitcoin for a number of years now, enabling people to get their hands on their first bitcoin. I think the first thing that people find out is that there are easier ways to get their first bitcoins. But as many people are exposed to new brands and service, whether good, bad or shady, a number of these users will go on to buy or trade bitcoins on exchanges, buy mining hardware to generate bitcoin themselves. or invest in cloud mining services.\nUsers visit the sites, usually plastered with advertising, and fill in a captcha and their bitcoin wallet address. A small amount (anything from 10-500 satoshi) is then transferred into an associated micro wallet, and the visitor needs to wait for a specified cool-down period from five to 240 minutes before being able to repeat the process. People then can systematically do this across several sites using the same micro wallet, which builds up. Once they pass the bitcoin network\u2019s 5430 minimum payment threshold , a payment is queued to be sent to a large batch of users on a set frequency.\nThe faucet business model is relatively straightforward. They start with an initial amount of bitcoin to get them going, and then they are monetised either through affiliate links to bitcoin merchants, advertising from bitcoin ad networks or Google advertising, or donations from users. Faucets also cross promote a range of similar sites on different domain names, and then offer users a percentage of any referral they bring in. As long as these numbers and volumes are maintained, it should cover itself, but it is also easy to knock the metrics out of line, with a drop in traffic, large fluctuations in bitcoin\u2019s price, or operators losing interest.\nThe market has also moved on somewhat, with a shift away from sites that look like they were designed off an old geocities template, and more professional sites such as Moonbit.co.in and BitcoinZebra.com offering a different take on the concept \u2013 usually with much larger payouts into their own wallet. A number of dice gambling sites like 999dice.com and freebitco.in offer a faucet as a way to be drawn into their games with the intention of getting people to make a lodgement and gamble it on the site.\nSo we\u2019ll have to wait and see what happens with these micro wallets; will they start working again, or will they shut down overnight without warning? Either way, this area of the bitcoin ecosystem is going through a shakeup which means opportunities for new entrants into the market. Have you used a bitcoin faucet, and did it lead you into spending more in bitcoin or not? Let us know in the comments box!", "year": 2013, "month": 10, "day": 25}

Nowadays he works for the crowdfunding platform @goteofunding and as a advisor for social economy as well as social and cryptocurrency initiatives. You can reach him on Twitter at @ferranrego\nLast September 17th to 19th, the Digital Currency Summit was celebrated in Andorra, the small country placed three hours away from Barcelona; it was a three day debate forum which treated topics like the use and importance of cryptocurrencies for banks, governments, investors and general public. In order to achieve that goal there were organised conferences and debates around four threads: \u201cIntroduction to Digital Currencies,\u201d \u201cInvestment opportunities,\u201d \u201cRegulation: laws and taxes,\u201d and \u201cFinancial and Banking,\u201d in addition to a presentation of several startups and cryptocurrency-related projects.Andorra is a micro-state composed of 85,000 people and characterized by a strong traditional banking system, and is usually considered as a tax haven \u2014althought it is not\u2014 because of its bank secrecy and a quite flexible fiscal system. Historically it has been a major financial center and a reliable place to deposit money in.Alex Puig, the event organizer, thought of Andorra as the idoneous place for this event to happen. As a software programmer, Bitcoin fanatic and expert in Andorra\u2019s startup and banking environment, it was for him a great opportunity to bring together a revolutionary technology with bankers, politicians, startups, and investors. And it worked out! Networking thrived amazingly well between persons from different fields during the breaks, even though we all missed the attendance of Andorran political representatives, who didn\u2019t appear.The talks and debates were exceptional, fueled by speakers as important as Jon Matonis, Constance Choi, Marco Santori and Flavio Pripas, who talked about a wide range of topics from cryptocurrencies to DAOs, the financial potential of Bitcoin or the way banks and startups can implement Bitcoin to their business models.These last talks were particularly interesting to the banking sector, well-represented by top Banks as \u201cBanca Privada d\u2019Andorra (BPA)\u201d and \u201cMoraBanc\u201d, that are realizing that the world is changing around them while the banking sector is being left behind. There are currently many voices in the Bitcoin community that think that Bitcoin doesn\u2019t add significant improvements as a currency compared to traditional currencies, and that see the true revolution of Blockchain and Bitcoin in their use as financial and services tools; that perspective might be more interesting to the banking system.That is the view of MoraBanc\u2019s delegate Juan Carlos Salinas, who thanks to the conferences has started to realize the huge potential about Bitcoin, even thought it is still too early for them to get involved in it as a business opportunity. Joan Manel Fern\u00e1ndez, from BPA, admits that they can hardly imagine Bitcoin as being really important in the future since that would mean to place confidence in a new decentralized structure with no financial intermediaries, and that will not be easy, but nevertheless they are resolved to keep abreast of cryptocurrency\u2019s development and to keep in touch with Bitcoin sector. On the other hand, both find regrettable the lack of institutional support to the Summit, given the suitability of Andorra for this kind of technological initiatives, in the same way that has been happening in other small scale and flexible States as Malta, Gibraltar and the Isle of Man. Jon Matonis, in his interview for El Diari Ara, said in similar terms that Andorran politicians should support banking efforts in implementing the new technologies providing security and predictability or, at least, not raise barriers against innovation. In his view, the banking sector should be less conservative if it wants to attract investment.We talked about all these topics with event organizer Alex Puig.Ferdinand Reyes: Good morning Alex, could you explain to us what is the approach of the meeting and what makes it different from other meetings?Alex Puig: Our approach was formative: we didn\u2019t want a conference focused on people who already knew about cryptocurrencies; we were rather interested in educating decision-makers and managers in the financial sector. We want to be the meeting point between the most disruptive entrepreneurs and the financial sector, maybe a bit more classic but yet willing to go forward to the XXIst century.FR: What is your assessment of the Summit? Did it fill your expectations?AP: Yes and no. It did in the qualitative side, the talks were high level and networking during the event has satisfied everyone beyond all the forecasts. In the two days of conferences I have seen the creation of many professional relationships and alliances that might end up in profitable businesses. On the other side, I expected this new technology to arouse peope\u2019s curiosity, and that Andorra could have attracted much more attendance. In this aspect I would have liked to pack the conference center.FR: What is the state of Bitcoin in Andorra? What does its future hold?AP: Bitcoin is currently alegal: there is no official position on the issue. If the government reacts and sets out a stable regulatory framework, Andorra might have the potential to attract Bitcoin startaps since it is not a fiscal haven and has got a deeply entrenched strong banking sector.FR: Andorra is a flexible country for business and investments. Has the summit had the impact you expected on financial and governmental circles?AP: In the private sector, definitely. Local big business and specially some Banks have changed their minds about cryptocurrencies and have started talking about studying deeply how it works and how to use it. We will see what happens with the government; one of their first priorities is to find for a new, less dependent on tourism and sustainable economic model for the country. However, they didn\u2019t show any interest in the Summit.FR: Are you looking forward to the next step or planning another project?AP: Yes, we are working to bring the Digital Currency Summit to Barcelona and Madrid in May 2015.FR: Thank you very much for the interview and for this fantastic Summit, Alex.The Summit left on me a very good impression due to its professional organization, the closeness of its organizers and the easiness with which I could talk with loads of people. I hope that the next events in Barcelona and Madrid will see a larger attendance; the high quality talks and the networking opportunities it brings are well worth taking a chance.Read this interview in Spanish.", "year": 2013, "month": 10, "day": 28}

We have Litecoin running with an alternative mining algorithm that is less skewed toward specialized hardware, Primecoin trying to make the process of mining more useful to society at large and offering very fast transaction confirmations, PPCoin doing away with traditional mining entirely, Krugercoin making confirmations even faster, and a new one appears to be popping up every week. More recently, a new type of cryptocurrency has started to appear: Bitcoin blockchain-based overlay currencies. These currencies, of which Bitshares and Mastercoin are currently the two leading contenders, do not try to live on their own blockchains; rather, they are a sort of overlay networks on top of Bitcoin, piggybacking on the Bitcoin transaction system to store data. Every Mastercoin transaction is a Bitcoin transaction, but the way in which the transaction is interpreted is different; what a Bitcoin client might see as an innocent transfer of a few satoshis a Mastercoin client may well see as the creation of a whole new currency inside the Mastercoin network. Are alternative currencies the future? Are any of the current ones likely to succeed, or is there still a missing piece of the puzzle? Read this interview for a glimpse into the state of alternative currencies right now.\nRon Gross is heavily involved in the Mastercoin project, but also runs Bitblu, a business whose goal is to make it easier for people to diversify their savings across many different alternative currencies, and Meni Rosenfeld is a cryptocurrency enthusiast and a key Bitcoin community organizer in Israel.\nVitalik Buterin: Ron, could you talk a little about your business, Bitblu?\nRon Gross: Bitcoin is the first digital currency. And as we know there are other clones or forks. Some of them are proper code forks, some are more spiritual forks. I consider Ripple a sort of fork; maybe fork is not the right word, but it\u2019s another cryptocurrency, and Mastercoin is another one, and maybe more will appear in the future. A question that a lot of new Bitcoiners ask when they consider investing in Bitcoin is, why invest in Bitcoin? Maybe another currency will take its place, and Bitcoin will not fulfill its vision of being the One True Currency. Bitcoin obviously has strong network effects and it\u2019s in a great position right now, and there is a chance that all the other coins will either stay small for a long time or people will abandon them. But there are also other possibilities, and Bitblu is offering our customers the ability to work with all of these other coins, and really manage their investments over time \u2013 not just in exchanges like btc-e, where they can buy a certain amount of coin and that\u2019s it. We have a very product-centric vision, we are always thinking about how we can make the user experience very simple and easy for people that do not understand these new currencies but want to invest a bit in them, and we will offer new tools for diversification. We will offer new indexes that automatically diversify across all the currencies, just like someone who wishes to buy stocks can buy Nasdaq, the S&P 500, and other indices. So we are developing indices for the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency space.\nIt\u2019s a project that I\u2019m starting with another founder, but Meni has also played a vital role in advising the company, and that\u2019s important to note.\nVB: About cryptocurrencies in general, what do you think are the most promising right now?\nRG: Bitcoin is of course number one. I usually just go by market cap, that\u2019s usually a good indicator. XRPs, or Ripple, have a huge market cap. Bitcoin today is worth around $1.5 billion, Ripple is around $1 billion, and most people don\u2019t realize this. Up until a few weeks ago most people could complain that Ripple is closed-source, and not really decentralized; I think that these claims are starting to wear off as they are now open-source and maybe they will be truly decentralized in the future.\nMeni Rosenfeld: It will never be truly decentralized because the underlying currency is 100% pre-mined. If you are talking about building a new economy based on peer-to-peer and so on, you can\u2019t do that if the currency that you use was all started by one company that does whatever it wants with it.\nRG: That may be a valid point. They have a strong team backing them, so they are certainly a viable player in this space, the payment network and the currency.\nMastercoin is also interesting in its own right. Litecoin is getting a lot of traction in the last six months. It does offer the promise of a more decentralized currency than Bitcoin because it reduces the power concentration of mining companies. That\u2019s the promise; it still remains to be seen if the promise will be fulfilled. Maybe soon enough we will see an ASICminer for Litecoin. There are also other projects that are trying to build a currency that is even harder to optimize or do in parallel than Litecoin. There are currencies that use six or more different algorithms, and something that is very easy to compute by a computer, but hard to build dedicated hardware for.\nPPCoin is also a very interesting concept; Meni and myself, by the way, have done a bit of work on proof of stake originally, and Sunny King has taken this and other work and built a coin using that. PPcoin tries to eliminate the mining industry altogether. It starts with proof of work mining and slowly moves to proof of stake, so it is very interesting. If it can be done, then of course we don\u2019t need to waste all this electricity and CPU cycles. One caveat with PPCoin is that it\u2019s a bit harder to analyze, so to understand what the exact money supply will be and the security model. I personally also like Primecoin, which is innovative and is trying to make the computations create a new public good. It\u2019s a matter of debate whether the chains of prime numbers that are generated are actually useful to anyone or not, maybe some mathematicians can testify. It\u2019s certainly an interesting role, trying to make the computations more useful for everyone.\nMR: I don\u2019t think that any of the current alts are really interesting. Maybe there will be interesting ones in the future, but if you take for example Litecoin, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s true that it will be more decentralized, because there will be ASIC miners. It will take a bit more time, but once it happens the same thing will happen that happened with Bitcoin. If you do a currency with a proof of work that is really immune to ASICs, then we will have CPU mining vs ASIC mining, but then the question is, is this better or worse? I don\u2019t know.\nAbout Primecoin, it\u2019s nice that they use a completely different work function, but I don\u2019t think their function is really all that useful, and I also don\u2019t think that it\u2019s really possible to do something which is useful, because in order to be good for cryptocurrency mining you need some very specific properties which I don\u2019t believe are compatible with any \u201cuseful computation\u201d, so I\u2019m a bit pessimistic about that. About proof of stake, that\u2019s an idea which I support and I\u2019m one of its early pioneers. I don\u2019t think any of the current implementations are really good. But, there is a concept of \u201cproof of activity\u201c, which is like a probabilistic proof of stake, so maybe that\u2019s a good direction for doing something which is not pure proof of work, as proof of work is very expensive. And as for Ripple, the idea of a credit network is very powerful, but the problem is that the XRP currency is centralized, so I hope we will see something which is decentralized but also has a fair distribution of the underlying currency.\nRG: anyone can fork it now, so maybe that will happen.\nMR: [There is also] Freicoin, the currency whose main feature is that there is demurrage, which is equivalent to perpetual inflation, which has some advantages and disadvantages. If they do the inflation and it\u2019s pretty mild, then maybe it can work. But what\u2019s interesting is that the same people who work on Freicoin are also working on developing FreiMarkets, which is an extension that can be applied to Freicoin or to Bitcoin or whatever, and it has a lot of interesting features like hierarchical transactions and so on, and also tag-based coloring of coins. So there are a few variants, which are currently still in the works. Whatever currency it will be applied to will become much more interesting.\nRG: Another thing to add. First, regarding FreiMarkets, currently there is a bunch of these projects going about. Mastercoin is one of them, there\u2019s FreiMarkets, there\u2019s BitShares, PeerShares. I have a limited amount of time, I can\u2019t understand each and every one of them. It\u2019s clear that there will be at least one decentralized market that follows these principles. Maybe it will be something else that takes the best of each of them, so it will be interesting to see how this develops. I want to add one more theoretical coin that doesn\u2019t exist yet, but I think it would be really interesting to develop, which is a quantum-resistant coin. There is a branch of algorithm research that specializes in developing algorithms that are immune to quantum computers. There are encryption and hashing algorithms that a quantum computer can\u2019t efficiently break. Regardless of the existence and performance of current quantum computers, it\u2019s useful to have a hedge against them. About the mining algorithms, it\u2019s important to understand that the proof of work algorithms in Bitcoin can be changed. Theoretically, if there is a consensus of 51% or more ,maybe 60% or 70% of the Bitcoin miners and users, then the entire SHA256 algorithm of Bitcoin can be replaced with whatever people agree would work. That doesn\u2019t change the fundamental workings of Bitcoin. But the thing is that in practice it would be extremely difficult to do this. Maybe what would happen in the real world, whether there is a scrypt-based or quantum-based proof of work, is that there would be a new coin and people would just buy the new coin instead. That will be easier on a political level I think.\nVB: That is actually,something that I\u2019ve heard from some Litecoin developers. A long time ago they had a DDOS attack against their chain where someone basically published a few million single-satoshi transactions, which every node now needs to download and verify, so what they\u2019re thinking of is essentially deleting those satoshis.\nRG: Well, that\u2019s not something that can happen in a decentralized currency.\nVB: The specific rule that they\u2019re thinking of is to make very very small outputs unspendable, and to add some kind of fee that you would have to pay for every output depending on how long ago it was spent, so you can see how in Bitcoin it would be politically impossible.\nRG: Alright, I need to go, this was very interesting, thank you.\nVB: Thank you!", "year": 2013, "month": 10, "day": 27}

Bitmarkers provides services to individuals interested in traveling to and enjoying the gambling hub of the world, Las Vegas, but with the Bitcoin currency. Those interested can work through Bitmarkers to book a hotel, determine the amount to gamble, fund and get started with a Bitmarkers account, receive floor credit to gamble with, fly to Vegas, and cash out on the casino floor or receive payout in BTC. CEO and Co-Founder, Ardon Lukasiewicz, provided an overview of Bitmarkers:\n\nBitmarkers is bringing the excitement of bitcoin to Las Vegas. By introducing their risk-free system to integrate bitcoin with commercial casinos\u2019 $140bn+ market, they have defined a new market for casinos. Bitmarkers is the simplest, most private, and cost saving solution to transferring money in and out of casinos for all types and levels of play. By utilizing casinos\u2019 interest-free loans called markers, a player can now fund their Bitmarkers account with bitcoin to fund their trip with just a laptop or cell phone. They are tackling the convoluted and costly system of transferring money and protect against money laundering. \u201cBitcoin is fully traceable and [a] player\u2019s identity is verified through gaming\u2019s trusted third parties,\u201d says Ardon Lukasiewicz CEO of Bitmarkers. Single players in these casinos can generate hundreds of millions of dollars in casino revenue alone and Ardon is excited to introduce these players to a better option which ultimately may be the largest transaction volume increase of practical use in bitcoin history.\nPlayers that use Bitmarkers benefit from frictionless transfers, a simplified marker process by making it digital, increased international privacy, and the removal of a specific player\u2019s country and bank methods that limit their decisions. In doing so, they have created a new way to gamble that is a win-win for players and casinos. Beyond Las Vegas, Bitmarkers has set its sights on international partnered casinos and especially Macau\u2019s robust gaming market. Macau\u2019s market is multiples larger than Las Vegas and has strict transfer rules due to money laundering problems. Currently, Macau\u2019s best option to fund a trip is through VIP groups and loading credit cards at pawn shops for an average 10% cut off the top. By authenticating player identity through Bitmarker\u2019s gateways, they plan to be the most anti-money laundering transfer option and make sending money frictionless to these casinos.\n\u201cWe envision a player wanting to keep their money in bitcoin for the growth potential, but also because it will enable players a frictionless way to fund their trips,\u201d says Ardon. By keeping a player\u2019s funds in bitcoin, they remove the need to repetitively work with post-trip payment and hurdles. Gambling and bitcoin seems to have a long-term relation in both the online gambling and now the commercial realm. Players can stay up to date on the latest news and gain founder membership to their \u201csecret forums\u201d by applying for their beta at www.bitmarkers.com/announcements.\nBitcoin Magazine looks forward to continuing to learn of new Bitcoin related companies and ideas to expand the utility and widespread use of Bitcoin as currency and movement.", "year": 2013, "month": 10, "day": 28}
{"title": "Decentralization: Key to Bitcoin\u2019s Success", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/decentralization-key-to-bitcoins-success-1383002925/", "birthday": "Oct 28, 2013  7:28 PM EST", "date": "2013-10-29 00:28:00", "content": "Bitcoin is now becoming a household name as, once again, the price of each coin is nearing 200 USD and more companies are selecting to accept payment in this convenient, yet new payment option. With the recent closure of Silk Road and the US government\u2019s temporary shutdown, Bitcoin has proven to be a force to be reckoned with.\nWhat makes Bitcoin unique? It is a digital, decentralized, cryptocurrency and a gateway to send money anywhere around the world with just the click of a mouse or the scan of a QR code to anyone with internet access. Proponents of Bitcoin pride themselves in supporting the lead cryptocurrency, which is based on peer to peer transactions. Yet, one must never take the decentralized nature of Bitcoin for granted.\nUnfortunately, any system can trend back towards centralization if not carefully monitored and safeguarded. As humans, we can, unfortunately, move towards centralized structures for an, often times, false sense of \u201csecurity\u201d and \u201ccertainty.\u201d Centralization tends to create more problems than naught when the power to make decisions falls into the hands of a select few. History provides evidence of the tremendous failure of central planning with the collapse of the Soviet Union, massive starvation and lack of development in North Korea, and right now a bloated US Government with a growing bureaucracy with an accompanied skyrocketing debt. On a US-centric note, how can a Washington bureaucrat really know and meet the needs of a school teacher in California or a farmer in Iowa? In the end of the day, each individual knows what is best for his/her needs and with systems and societies based on greater individual responsibility, in turn systems will be stronger and more diverse and meet more needs than blanket solutions and inefficient \u201cone-size fits all\u201d policies. So, while there is comfort in having to be responsible for less in the short-run, there are too many unintended long term consequences.\nBitcoin is not just a currency, but a movement towards decentralization in society, government, financial systems, and thought. Bitcoin has served as a catalyst to provide power to individuals seeking to separate themselves from constricting governing bodies and failing central banks. To date, Bitcoin has been characterized as an open source project prompting discussion of the role of money in society, the danger of current banking structures, and the creative decentralized solutions to centralized problems in society today.\nA model of organized decentralization is key to the success of Bitcoin around the world. \u00a0Decentralization does not equate to chaos, but many individuals at work to promote a project with the common goal of strengthening a project and not placing trust in one entity. The best example of organized decentralization would be grass roots activism and organization within the Bitcoin community instead of central actors making all major decisions and protocol adjustments. \u00a0Each member of the Bitcoin community serves a unique role and has a distinct voice and part to play in keeping the Bitcoin currency on a pathway to success, growth in value and utility, and a global reach. Most members of the Bitcoin community already recognize that the larger the user base, the less volatile the currency, and the greater legitimacy lent to the currency.\nOpen source software is also vital to the preservation and strengthening of Bitcoin. With decentralization in the development community, there is greater room and leverage for an increased number of individuals to enter the community and contribute. The question, then, may arise as to how the Bitcoin Qt client can remain decentralized. An option which has prompted growth in Bitcoin development is when businesses have given back to the Bitcoin community through hiring individuals to solely work on the Qt client. There is value in the marketplace of ideas as trial and error and diversity of thought inspires the development of the strongest wallets, payment processors, and software. There is too much risk in entrusting all development and protocol to a few. The Bitcoin community must continue its commitment to the open-source ideals that make Bitcoin the resilient system it is today.\nAs Bitcoin continues to increase in value and central banks continue to disappoint, it is clear that decentralization leads to healthier societies and global financial success. \u00a0What will become of Bitcoin? To date, Bitcoin is the most successful cryptocurrency and is still in earlier stages of development. \u00a0What we do know: a model of organized decentralization is vital to the success of the Bitcoin currency and movement.", "year": 2013, "month": 10, "day": 29}

He is also a board member of the Dutch Bitcoin Foundation.\nFrom Holland with Love\nThe city of Amsterdam, capital of the Netherlands and home to the world\u2019s oldest stock exchange, established in 1602, has played a role throughout history as a safe harbor for new ideas. Now it may be on its way to becoming an important Bitcoin destination, and not only for its innovative Bitcoin businesses and its flurry of international Bitcoin conferences.\nThis past June Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem gave a Bitcoin-friendly report to Parliament. He said:\nBitcoin is not electronic money\u2026 At present its eventual impact on the real economy seems negligible\u2026Bitcoin is not a financial product as defined by law. (Mediation in) the purchase or sale of Bitcoins is not a financial service either, so the Financial Supervision Act does not apply.\nAccording to these statements Bitcoins are officially recognized as local currency without any special compliance or licensing requirements. As it now stands, trading with bitcoins in the Netherlands is legally no different from barter with sticks of butter, plastic chips or bottles of beer.\nRight now anyone with a Dutch bank account can buy bitcoins online in real time without any registration process. Several Dutch services are helping users buy (and sell) with an existing payment system called iDeal. The purchased coins can be directly transferred into a mobile wallet called PikaPay that you can create just by signing in with your Twitter Name. (Disclosure: I am involved in PikaPay.)\nMany other ingredients are in place to make Amsterdam a city with a lot of Bitcoin in its future. Source Forge ranks The Netherlands as country number 8 in downloads of the client software so far this year. This month Dolf Diederichsen decided to launch his startup bit4coin in Amsterdam to benefit from the attractive atmosphere, and BitPay, one of the best-funded Bitcoin companies, has picked Amsterdam as the site of its European HQ. Both Mr. Diederichsen and BitPay CEO Tony Gallippi cited the regulatory environment as reason to establish companies here. \u201cI believe there is a lower risk of regulatory overreaction here than we have seen in some other markets,\u201d Mr. Diederichsen said.\nOf course the banks are not all happy about this situation. On October 19, 2013 one of the country\u2019s oldest daily newspapers, Het Financi\u00eble Dagblad, published a critical article asking the government to regulate Bitcoin. The four main arguments behind the call for regulation were:\nBitcoin is digital money that can be used anonymously.Therefore regulators can\u2019t estimate systemic risk.Thereby making Bitcoin a threat to the \u201cstability and trust\u201d of the current financial system.Regulators should restrict \u201cbad coins\u201d (the ones they don\u2019t like) in favor of \u201cgood coins.\u201d\nThe authors of the piece, Bas Straathof and Remco Mocking, are both researchers from the Dutch Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, an independent policy research institution 80% funded by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.\nThe Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs, Henk Kamp, is a member of the conservative Freedom and Democracy Party (VVD), whereas Finance Minister Dijsselbloem is a member of the relatively more liberal and possibly more Bitcoin-friendly Labor Party (PVDA). The current government in the Netherlands is a coalition between these two parties. At least one of the opposition parties is known to be investigating its position on Bitcoin so that there may eventually be a number of different political perspectives on the cryptocurrency from which citizens of the Netherlands can choose.\nWhile it\u2019s unlikely that any meaningful steps would be taken on the basis of publications like the piece done by Mr. Straathof and Mr. Mocking, it does show a burning need for education and awareness at all levels of society. The Dutch Bitcoin Foundation, of which I am a board member, was recently created to help raise the level of conversation from \u201cbad coins\u201d versus \u201cgood coins\u201d to something more substantial to help Bitcoin reach its true potential in Dutch society.\nWhen researchers and policymakers begin to have even an inkling of Bitcoin\u2019s deeper significance \u2013 more than \u201canonymous digicash created by evil hackers to buy contraband from drug dealers\u201d \u2013 there\u2019s a better chance that banks and governments of the world will start to get serious about cleaning up the global mess they\u2019ve created.\nBitcoin is not a problem that needs to be regulated. To quote our Dutch Minister of Finance, \u201cBitcoin is not electronic money.\u201d Bitcoin is a movement that has grown into a technology that is created by a community of the world\u2019s best and brightest as a solution to that very problem of stability and trust.\n\u2014\nUpdate:\nA slightly longer form of Straathof and Mocking\u2019s article has appeared online (in Dutch).\nA short (Dutch language) interview has also been published. In the interview they state, \u201cIt is unlikely that Bitcoin will ever prove to be a trustworthy alternative to national currencies like the dollar or euro because no government will guarantee it.\u201d\n\n", "year": 2013, "month": 10, "day": 29}

Unlike most other protocols, where features can be added, modified or deprecated at a moment\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s notice, in the world of Bitcoin even the slightest change requires the simultaneous cooperation of the vast majority of the entire Bitcoin network. The reason for this is simple: in Bitcoin, and in Bitcoin alone, absolute consensus is required. On internet protocols like HTML and CSS, if a web browser interprets some style elements incorrectly, the worst that can happen is that the webpage renders incorrectly. In Bitcoin, on the other hand, a single transaction being incorrectly valid or invalid makes the entire block invalid, potentially causing the entire network to split in half as it did in March 2013. As a result, most of the decisions that Satoshi Nakamoto made in 2008 we are essentially stuck with. Although Satoshi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s choices were by no means perfect, fortunately it appears that he has been right more often than not; in fact, there are several instances in which we are all better off for the choices Satoshi made for reasons that even he did not imagine.\nAddresses as hashes of public keys\n\n5JexEhxcSeADA4MmpHq426zC2935JHKc2de1nphv75u8TRhAqqP\n\n\n1MEMPfCcqatuWxHWFsFcyhDTq3eV61xLB4\npublic key cryptography\nkey pair\ndigitally signs\n\nOne can see how this can be used in a Bitcoin-like currency: everyone publishes their public keys, and sending from A to B requires A to sign a message containing B\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s public key with his private key. From this, the protocol would be able to infer that A authorized a transaction sending some money to B. \nBitcoin, however, is more complicated. A Bitcoin address is not the public key; rather, the Bitcoin address is the hash of the public key. A hash is a function that can take anything as an input, and produces a fixed-size output, with the property that it is nearly impossible to invert. That is, given a message M, it is easy to calculate hash(M), but given hash(M) it would take until beyond the heat death of the universe to find M. With Bitcoin, the relationship between private keys and addresses is as follows:\n\nSo how do transactions work? Aside from the obvious information about the transaction itself, a Bitcoin transaction contains two things: the spender\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s public key, and a signature made with the spender\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s private key. Anyone verifying the transaction checks (1) that the hash of the public key is the spender\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s address, and (2) that the signature verifies with the public key. Taken together, these facts are a proof that the transaction was made (or authorized) by the owner of the private key corresponding to the spender\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s address.\nThe point of this is surprisingly mundane: under the elliptic curve DSA cryptosystem that Bitcoin uses, a public key is 512 bits long, meaning that it would take close to a hundred characters to represent. For example, here\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s what a public key looks like:\n04b52fd5a616a8f08ccad58469102f86fc7891e5aa4262ab8d43e41767c17d45b80850044a62af51783609176daf02fc46221057a8de11ee6ae8743065b27a4b5e\nMeanwhile, the corresponding Bitcoin address in hexadecimal form is just:\n4b463093e6fc3135a4de2ff577c4b658198777a9\nAnd in its more familiar base58 form:\n1obodiqhAZ3GD9onBXRZ9v7hshkuBreCu\nIn reality, however, this does not accomplish nearly as much as Satoshi thought it did. As it turns out, there is a way of encoding public keys in a much more compact way, taking up only 257 bytes:\n\n03c5c9833d00bed3211a5f3733316ecf6ebc407806d70caa14862f1e2e8c2f852d\nAnd if we had decided to put this into base58 form:\n\n15sqRCowBDTfyuxPQD3ba8sN3wBB8MwGbo6gsBEGeKmUbNQADGh\nNot really that much longer than the addresses we use today. So did Satoshi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s choice simply introduce unnecessary complexity and waste? As it turns out, the answer is no. There is another very good reason to use the hash-of-public-key address construction: quantum cryptography. Quantum computers are capable of breaking elliptic curve DSA (ie. given a public key, a quantum computer can very quickly find the private key), but they cannot similarly reverse hash algorithms (or rather, they can, but it would take one 280 computational steps to crack a Bitcoin address, which is still very much impractical). Thus, if your Bitcoin funds are stored in an address that you have not spent from (so the public key is unknown), they are safe against a quantum computer - at least until you try to spend them. There are theoretical ways to make Bitcoin fully quantum-safe, but the fact that an address is simply a hash of a public key does mean that once quantum computers do come out attackers will be able to do much less damage before we fully switch over.\nThe 21 Million BTC limit\nOne somewhat controversial property of Bitcoin is its fixed currency supply. There are currently 25 BTC being generated every 10 minutes, and this amount cuts in half every four years. All in all, there will never be more than 21 million BTC in existence. On the other hand, each bitcoin can be split into 100 million pieces (called \"satoshis\"), so it will not become difficult to use Bitcoin if its value goes up the same way it would become problematic to trade with dollars if each penny was enough to buy a car. Thus, all in all, the total number of currency units that will ever exist stands at 2,100,000,000,000,000: 2.1 quadrillion, or about 250.899. In choosing this figure, Satoshi was much luckier, or wiser, than most people realize. First of all, the number is considerably less than 264 - 1, the largest integer that can be stored in a standard integer on a computer - go above that, and the integers wrap around to zero like an odometer.\nSecond, however, there is another, lower threshold that the total satoshi count manages to fall just below: the largest possible integer that can be exactly represented in floating point format. Integers are not the only kind of number that computers can store; to handle decimal numbers, computers use a format known as floating point representation. Floating point representation is essentially a binary version of scientific notation. For example, here are some values that you may be familiar with if you studied any physics:\nMass of the Earth: 5.972 * 1024 kgMass of the Sun: 1.989 * 1030 kgSpeed of light: 2.998 * 108 m/sOne lightyear: 9.460 * 1015 mMass of a proton: 1.672 * 10-27 kgPlanck length: 1.616 * 10-35 m\nNotice how scientific notation allows you to express all of these values with reasonable accuracy despite their wildly varying scales. Floating point notation is essentially scientific notation in binary; when you store the number 9.625, your computer stores \"1.001101 * 1011\" (or rather, it stores 01000000 00100011 01000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000, which is the same thing in high-precision serialized form). In this high-precision form, the \"significand\" (the part that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not the exponent) has 52 bits. What this means is that high-precision (more precisely, \"double precision\") floating point numbers are good enough to exactly store integers up to 253, but not higher - if you go higher, you start lopping off digits at the end. Bitcoin\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s 250.9 satoshis are, in exponential terms, just below this maximum. \nWhy do we care about floating point values if we have integers? Because many higher-level programming languages (eg. Javascript) do not expose the low-level \"floating point\" and \"integer representations\", instead providing the programmer with only the concept of \"number\" - represented in floating point form, of course. If Satoshi had chosen 210 million instead of 21 million, Bitcoin programming in many languages would be considerably harder than it is today.\nNote that Stefan Thomas in his BitcoinJS library did not take advantage of this, so that library uses a specialized \"big number\" object instead of a plain number to store transaction output values. When asked about this, Thomas replied that he realized that using regular numbers was possible, but BitcoinJS needed to include the \"big number\" library regardless, since elliptic curve arithmetic requires numbers up to 2512, so the choice was arbitrary. My own BitcoinJS fork (which also adds other improvements) does use plain numbers to store the number of satoshis, a decision motivated largely by the desire to be compatible with external sources of transaction output data such as sx and pybitcointools.\nChoosing the right elliptic curve\nElliptic curve cryptography, the kind of cryptography used by Bitcoin to digitally sign and verify transactions, is not a single standardized way of signing messages; there are in fact many different \"curves\" to choose from. To understand what different \"curves\" are, it first helps to have a basic understanding of how the math behind ECC works. In general, an elliptic curve is a set of points (x,y) on a two-dimensional plane such that the equation y2 = x3 + ax + b holds, where a and b are parameters of the curve. Here is what one elliptic curve looks like:\n\nElliptic curve cryptography relies on operations called \"point addition\" and \"point doubling\" on such a curve, operations which are best described in diagrams:\n\nEssentially, to add two points P and Q, trace a line between them, locate the other point on the curve that the line intersects, and trace a vertical line from that point to get your answer. However, for cryptographic purposes these ordinary elliptic curves have a weakness: they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re imprecise. If you do very many point additions, floating point rounding errors will slowly accumulate, and eventually the result will be entirely meaningless noise. Thus, elliptic curve cryptography uses an elliptic curve with two modifications. First, the equation is now y2 = x3 + ax + b + kp, where k can be any integer and p is some large prime number (a parameter of the curve alongside a and b). Second, x and y must be integers. Although the resulting set is hardly a \"curve\", surprisingly enough the same math still works, and the restriction to integers avoids rounding errors.\nThere are many different curve parameters that could be used; the SEC2 document provides the standard ones. In general, however, the curves fall into two categories: \"pseudorandom\" curves and Koblitz curves. In a pseudorandom curve, the parameters a and b are chosen by a specified algorithm (essentially a hash) from a certain \"seed\". For secp256r1, the standard 256-bit pseudorandom curve, the seed is c49d360886e704936a6678e1139d26b7819f7e90, giving rise to the parameters:\np = 115792089210356248762697446949407573530086143415290314195533631308867097853951a = 115792089210356248762697446949407573530086143415290314195533631308867097853948b = 41058363725152142129326129780047268409114441015993725554835256314039467401291\nThe obvious question is this: where did the seed come from? Why was the seed not chosen to be some more innocent-looking number, like 15? In light of recent revelations regarding the US National Security Agency subverting cryptographic standards, an obvious concern is that the seed was somehow deliberately chosen in order to make the curve weak in some way that only the NSA knows. Thankfully, the wiggle room is not unlimited. Because of the properties of hash functions, the NSA could not have found one \"weak\" curve and then gone backward to determine the seed; rather, the only avenue of attack is to try different seeds until one turns out to generate a curve that is weak. If the NSA knows of an elliptic curve vulnerability that affects only one specific curve, the pseudorandom parameter generation process would prevent them from standardizing it. However, if they knew of a weakness in one in every billion curves, then the process offers no protection; for all we know, c49d360886e704936a6678e1139d26b7819f7e90 could have been the billionth seed that the National Institute for Standards in Technology tried.\nFortunately, Bitcoin does not use pseudorandom curves; Bitcoin uses Koblitz curves. In Bitcoin\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s secp256k1, the parameters are:\n\np = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663a = 0b = 7\nThat\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s it. And even p is quite simple to generate; it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s only 2256 - 232 - 977 (in the interests of fairness, p and a in secp256r1 are also fairly simple; it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s b that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s problematic). The simplicity of these parameters gives the NSA / NIST very little wiggle room to create a deliberately bad curve. And even the specific values of 0, 7 and 977 can be justified by security and efficiency constraints, so the chance that Bitcoin\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s elliptic curve parameters were chosen with any malicious intent is very low indeed. When Dan Brown, the current chairman of the Standards for Efficient Cryptography Group, was asked about this, he replied: \"I did not know that BitCoin is using secp256k1. Indeed, I am surprised to see anybody use secp256k1 instead of secp256r1.\" If secp256r1 is actually compromised, then since Bitcoin is one of the few applications that is using secp256k1 instead of secp256r1, Bitcoin has truly dodged a bullet.\n\n", "year": 2013, "month": 10, "day": 28}

Ploshay (Bitcoin Magazine)\nThe fierce \u201carms race\u201d of the Bitcoin network has triggered concern over network fairness. At the beginning of Bitcoin\u2019s birth, every individual could mine Bitcoin easily with a personal computer. According to Hal Finney, an early partner working with Satoshi, he gained thousands of Bitcoins within a few weeks by mining with his personal computer. Yet, today Bitcoin has become the \u201cprivate mine\u201d of mega mining corporation and professional miners who own many ASIC devices, which to some appears unfair. People also worry that Bitcoins are concentrated in the hands of a small group of people, which in turn hinders promotion of the currency. The Coase theorem states, however, that with zero or little transaction cost and clear property rights, the market could reach its Pareto efficiency of resources allocation, no matter to whom the property is given. A system would also be fair if the ownership of the rights of property is established from the start.\nSatoshi did thoroughly consider the design of the Bitcoin mining mechanism. He was confronted with two options: one allocating Bitcoins to all users according to the number of the nodes, namely one-IP-address-one-vote; the other allocating Bitcoins to the miners according to the computing power, namely one-CPU-one-vote. He chose the latter considering the security of Bitcoin network. He wrote in the White Paper that \u201cIf the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs.\u201d Miners obtain Bitcoins by processing transaction data, which may be viewed as an incentive mechanism. In retrospect, however, miners should put in their computing power to obtain Bitcoins which could be deemed as a public resource. Since the security of the Bitcoin network is proportionate to the network\u2019s computing power, the computing power put in by miners are used to ensure the security of the network, enabling normal users to trade safely without putting in any computing power. This is fair to both the users and the miners.\nAlthough the initial allocation of Bitcoins was established by the protocol, the market decides final allocation. Users possess the right to collect computing power from miners and this right can be sold, meaning miners \u201cpay\u201d the computing power to users in exchange for the ownership of Bitcoins in the block. On the other hand, miners possess the right to obtain Bitcoins in a block and this right can also be sold, which means users can then purchase Bitcoins from miners without putting in computing power. If the computing power paid by miners is higher than the revenue generated by mining, miners would put in less computing power. If the expense paid by users to purchase Bitcoin is higher than the mining cost, more and more users would join the mining industry. The market would reach equilibrium at the end and a highly-efficient allocation between computing power and Bitcoins could be reached.\nIn the first days after Bitcoin was created, transaction cost was almost zero and some special users could realize certain goals with small-amount-transaction. For example, Wikileaks coded some secret files in the blockchain with huge quantities of small-amount-transactions; gambling websites like SatoshiDice informed their users of the gambling results (or even sent commercials) with small-amount-transactions. These past actions have put more burdens on the blockchain. Some view that those users who overused the small-amount-transactions have taken too much public resource, and they support a transaction tax. This Pigouvian-Tax-like design can reduce the junk transaction to a huge extent and equalize the private cost and social cost of the transaction.\nThe rule of levying the transaction tax of Bitcoin, when calculated is economical. It would discourage trivial payment, meaning that if the output of a payment is less than 0.01BTC, a transaction fee of 0.0001BTC would be collected. A payment with Bitcoins having a longer history and value is prioritized. The trade data is then \u201cweighed\u201d and a fee is collected for each kilobyte. As a unit tax, the transaction tax could be levied relatively ideally with the adjustment of deft mathematical algorithm. Consequently those who do a lot of small-amount-transactions must refrain due to the high costs, while regular users can still keep the cost edge compared to traditional ways of payment. Thus, micro-adjustments can still be made by updating the protocol.\n", "year": 2013, "month": 10, "day": 28}

{"title": "What Firstbits Is and Why You Should Implement It", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/what-firstbits-is-and-why-you-should-implement-it-1379244557/", "birthday": "Sep 15, 2013  7:29 AM EST", "date": "2013-09-15 12:29:00", "content": "Recently, there has been a considerable amount of interest in making Bitcoin usable in environments where the technological comforts that we take for granted every day are simply not present. Kipochi is in the process of developing a Bitcoin wallet that works over cell phone text messages, allowing people with ordinary \u201cdumb phones\u201d in Africa (which are, despite the continent\u2019s general poverty, nearly ubiquitious throughout the region) to use Bitcoin simply by sending and receiving text messages. More recently, Coinbase has done the same thing. In Austria, Mycelium Media is in the process of developing a \u201cBitcoin card\u201d that is essentially a fully-fledged physical Bitcoin wallet capable of holding money and sending and receiving transactions but is only the size of a credit card \u2013 thickness included. The company is also releasing Mycelium Wallet for smartphones running Android, and on the iPhone Gliph is finally breaking through in rolling out a Bitcoin solution. The future of Bitcoin, it seems, is mobile, just like the future of everything else in our modern world.\nThe problem is, however, how do you actually tell the wallet who to send to? On the desktop, the solution is simple: copy and paste the recipient\u2019s Bitcoin address. And for those who don\u2019t like addresses, the Bitcoin developers are coming up with a payment protocol that substitutes them with a system of payment requests. On smartphones, scanning a QR code seems to be the ubiquitous answer. Problem solved? Not quite. All of these solutions certainly have their place, and when they work they are certainly very effective ways of identifying who you intend to send money to. On the desktop, all commerce is e-commerce, so if you don\u2019t have an internet connection to send Bitcoin transactions and receive sending addresses over then you also do not have an internet connection to find anything worth paying for. In person, however, the situation is different. In theory, there are of course solutions for everything; if you want to send to a merchant, you scan a QR code from their own mobile application. If you want to send to a phone number, type in that phone number and the SMS wallet\u2019s backend will figure out what Bitcoin address belongs to that particular number. Want to send to an email address? Same thing.\nHowever, perhaps the single most undervalued rule of usability design in general is this: do not optimize for the case of how things work when they work. Rather, optimize for the case of how things work when they don\u2019t work. People can figure out their way around unintuitive software quirks if those quirks are predictable; however, people with little background in Bitcoin are going to have a very hard time getting around the corner cases that leave even Bitcoin afficionados whipping out their laptops and opening up command line interfaces. Anyone who actually spends time in in-person Bitcoin environments knows that the internet is often missing or not present at all, merchants don\u2019t yet have a wallet application installed, you\u2019re trying to send to a QR code printed on paper or, worst of all, the phone is not working and there is no QR code printed on paper, leaving you no choice but to type in a 34-character address manually, on a smartphone keyboard.\nThe case of SMS wallets is similar. Right now, we have Kipochi and Coinbase, and they do not even serve the same region. What if, in two years\u2019 time, we\u2019ll have three different SMS wallets serving every region, and people using different wallets want to transact with each other. Currently, the best that we have is a very poor solution: every provider forces everyone to have an account. If you send money to a phone number with your Coinbase SMS wallet, and that number does not yet have Coinbase, then the system that will soon be implemented is that that phone number will receive instructions on how to create a Coinbase account to retrieve their money. With one provider, this works fine. But suppose there are five; suppose, in 2015, that there are SMS wallets run by Coinbase, blockchain.info, Kipochi, Bitstamp and BIPS, and each of them works in the same way.\nThe result is obvious: each and every person would need to keep track of five different accounts. The five companies could come together and create a common database, but this runs the risk of creating a centralized and anti-competitive ecosystem; if a new company wants to join, they essentially need the existing consortium\u2019s permission. How do we create a decentralized common database? Well, we already have the blockchain, and it is certainly not difficult at all to design a common protocol for registering your cellphone number by sending a specially formatted transaction (essentially, this involves sending 0.0001 BTC to a fake Bitcoin address encoding your number, and SMS wallet backends can detect these transactions and search through them). However, that will take work to create, and for now, once again, Bitcoin addresses are all we have. The moral of the story is this: Bitcoin addresses are the ultimate fallback, and to make wallets what \u201cwork when they don\u2019t work\u201d it is simply necessary to have a good way of entering them.\nEnter Firstbits\nThe idea behind firstbits has been around for nearly two years now. Essentially, how it works is this. The firstbits of an address is simply the first few characters of that address, converted to lowercase; the first bits of 1McqmmnxRwZRCpD2VoGEMzCYcdeXYvCBsB, for example, is \u201c1mcqmmnx\u201d. To recover the address from a firstbits, simply take the first Bitcoin address to appear in the blockchain that matches that firstbits. Because the first Bitcoin address is used, there is no ambiguity, and future blocks cannot change a firstbits to address mapping that already exists. To determine exactly how many characters to use, simply try just the first character of your address, then the first two, then the first three and so on until the firstbits maps to your address. \u201c1mcqmmn\u201d, for example, maps to \u201c1McqmmnNB7urUowJULWHnSfKio8fw7a55m\u201c, but \u201c1mcqmmnx\u201d maps to 1McqmmnxRwZRCpD2VoGEMzCYcdeXYvCBsB as desired (and so do, and forever will, \u201c1mcqmmnxr\u201d, \u201c1mcqmmnxrw\u201d and so on), so we use \u201c1mcqmmnx\u201d. The result is an \u201caddress shortening\u201d service, similar to URL shorteners like bit.ly, but which is an open standard requiring no centralized gatekeepers.\nThe idea has been out there, it seems obvious, and yet for some reason almost no wallet providers have tried to integrate it. The obvious question is: why? As it turns out, the majority of Bitcoin developers are against it. The arguments given in the above linked Bitcoin wiki page are as follows:\nFirstbits enourages Bitcoin users to generate addresses with \u201cinteresting\u201d firstbits and \u201cclaim\u201d them by sending a transaction to those addresses just to make sure they make it into the blockchain, similar to the practice of \u201cdomain squatting\u201d, or registering short domain names on the internet with the aim of selling them later at a profit. This increases blockchain bloat, meaning that miners have to store a larger amount of transactions, and also means that if firstbits becomes widely used anything shorter than a 7-letter firstbits will become impossible.Firstbits is vulnerable to confusion; for example, Wikileaks deliberately created a Bitcoin address starting with \u201c1snow\u201d for their Edward Snowden fund. However, the actual firstbits of that address is \u201c1snowq\u201d, with \u201c1snow\u201d itself going to \u201c1SnowmhKHWcKZCFcv7Qjtg3jqhW2f3naZ\u201c. Similarly, the firstbits of the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s addrss, 1BTCorgHwCg6u2YSAWKgS17qUad6kHmtQW, is \u201c1btcorgh\u201d, not \u201c1btcorg\u201d. Fortunately, no one was caught by this accidental trap, but if firstbits was more commonly used, people might be.Many developers hold the position that \u201cBitcoin was designed such that addresses should only be used once\u201d. Thus, the whole idea of creating a \u201cvanity address\u201d (whether \u201c1snow\u2026\u201d, \u201c1BRMLAB\u2026\u201d or \u201c1BTCorg\u2026\u201d) starting with some specific easily memorable prefix and widely publicizing it for long term use should be strongly discouraged.It\u2019s impractical for the average Bitcoin client to maintain a firstbits database, as such a database would be gigabytes in size. Therefore, firstbits requires central service providers, and so it would be better to just use a proprietary database so as to avoid the other three problems described above.\nSome of these arguments have merit, and some may or may not have merit depending on whether or not you think blockchain bloat is a problem; others, however, completely miss the point. The argument about \u201cfirstbits\u201d squatting is a decent argument against using \u201cvanity firstbits\u201d like \u201c1brmlab\u201d; however, what it misses completely is the fact that vanity firstbits is not the main point of firstbits; rather, the main point of firstbits is to let people enter a few characters of an address manually and have it autocomplete. This can be done with any address. \u201cDomain squatting\u201d all possible addresses above about 7 letters is impossible; even at 7 letters, claiming half of them requires claiming 32 billion addresses, or over a hundred times the current size of the blockchain. As for confusion, the solution is simple. On the user side, user can be more careful and type in nine characters instead of seven; this reduces the risk of a mismatch by a factor of over a thousand. On the software side, the software should always give the full address back and ask for confirmations; on an SMS wallet, the interaction might look like this:\n> send 0.01 1mcqmmn1McqmmnNB7urUowJULWHnSfKio8fw7a55mCorrect? (yes / no)> no 1mcqmmnx1McqmmnxRwZRCpD2VoGEMzCYcdeXYvCBsBCorrect? (yes / no)> yesSent 0.01 BTC to 1McqmmnxRwZRCpD2VoGEMzCYcdeXYvCBsB.\nIf you need to pay people remotely (eg. you\u2019re an employer and you want to give your farm workers 1 BTC per week but you won\u2019t always be there yourself), you can simply store the full address, or even just half of it, in your phone\u2019s address book, and then get the firstbits from there when needed. Another use case is on a smartphone; there, the interaction is similar, but more fluid; one might imagine the Android app showing the current firstbits completion of a given address in grey in the textbox while you write it. Leaving the textbox implies acknowledging that a given completion is correct.\nLastly, there is the \u201ccentralization\u201d argument. When making this claim, what opponents of firstbits fail to understand is that there are several degrees of centralization. At one end, there is full centralization, where everything relies on one, completely trusted, central authority; a good example is Facebook. At the other end, there is full decentralization, where all nodes are essentially equal. Here, we have perhaps Bittorrent. In the middle, there is the concept of \u201cfederation\u201d: centralized providers exist, but they all follow a common protocol, there are many to choose from and each one can be swapped for any other in an instant. Email providers, Bitcoin mining pools, Bitcoin block explorers and Ripple gateways all fall into this category \u2013 and so do Firstbits providers.\nFederation is not perfect, but it is a massive improvement over centralization; if email was not federated, users of different email providers would have a hard time communicating, and it is quite likely that today there would be only one email provider of any scale left standing. With federation, there are businesses and institutions, but it is much harder to lock out new competition, betray one\u2019s customers or become a monopoly. In the case of Bitcoin address shorteners, it also means that a wallet can query three servers run by three different institutions, preventing any one of them from substituting in their own Bitcoin addresses in a fraudulent attempt to seize bitcoins in transit. Bitcoin address shorteners like btc.to are centralized; firstbits is federated.\nFirstbits is certainly not a panacea; at best, it will remain a backup option, as in most cases copy/paste, QR code scanning and sending to emails and phone numbers will work fine. It does not even always work; if an address has never sent or received any money, then it is not in the blockchain and so firstbits has no way of recovering it. However, in those cases where it can be used, it is invaluable. Having to type in seven to nine characters on a smartphone is annoying, and on a dumb phone with only twelve buttons for 0-9, * and # it is quite hard. However, typing in an entire thirty four characters is brutal.\nSo what is the next step? If a firstbits server exists, implementing firstbits is easy; just call the API and get the address back. And a firstbits server does exist, in the form of blockchain.info; to see the API in action, just open up http://blockchain.info/q/resolvefirstbits/1mcqmmnx in your browser. Using \u2018getfirstbits\u2019 instead of \u2018resolvefirstbits\u2019 does the inverse operation. However, this server is not always reliable, and has been known to go down at times. Thus, what is needed is for more companies to do the same, and ideally for someone to create an open-source version. Caution is important; the service must do the same thing as blockchain.info in case two addresses with the same firstbits appear for the first time in the same block. Getting bitcoind to include a firstbits database may seem like the best solution of all, but this would be excessive; firstbits requires an entire database of its own, so it is not worth the bloat to have every single full Bitcoin node running one. Once firstbits is implemented, well, it will be one small step closer to making Bitcoin convenient and easy to use for the masses. These days, nearly everything has some form of \u201cautocomplete\u201d functionality; so why not Bitcoin addresses as well?", "year": 2013, "month": 9, "day": 15}

Bitcoin Magazine is proud to serve as a sponsor alongside of Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin, The Bitcoin Foundation, Students for Liberty, FEE, and Atlanta Bitcoin of this conference spearheaded by Jeffrey Tucker, Executive Editor of Laissez Faire Club and Laissez Faire Books, Distinguished Fellow for the Foundation for Economic Education, and Research Fellow of the Action Institute.\nThe purpose of the conference will be to connect monetary economists, legal theorists, banking pundits, code-slinging visionaries, miners, and payment-systems analysts to shed light on the rise of Bitcoin. As Bitcoin is not just a currency but a movement towards greater economic freedom the 2013 Crypto-Conference will address the following questions:\nWhat does the success of Bitcoin imply for the theory, practice, and future of money and payment systems?How can we account for the sheer implausibility of Bitcoin\u2019s rise?What does its emergence imply for the prospects of nationalized systems of money and the future of human liberty and commerce?Will Bitcoin go the way of most innovations and fall prey to government\u2019s dead hand of regulation and strangulation?\nThe Conference team hopes to shed light on how Bitcoin, in contrast to most currencies, has in fact increased in value over time. Over the past 100 years, the value of money has fallen to carry only about 5% of its purchasing power. As a decentralized, digital currency, Bitcoin is not beholden to a central bank and has emerged as a solution to bypass fiat money. The speed and ease of transaction makes the crypto-standard stronger than the gold standards.\nThe Conference will open with a Friday night reception at the office of BitPay, Inc., one of the lead Bitcoin payment processing companies, where guests will hear from musician Tatiana Moroz who as a guitarist and songwriter sings about human liberty. On Saturday morning, Jeffrey Tucker will provide the keynote address, \u201cA New Currency for the Digital Age,\u201d at the The Twelve Hotel in Atlantic Station, a post-industrial hub of Atlanta. Panels will include discussions of Money and Freedom, Cryptography and Contracts, Merchantcraft, and Future Development.\nSpeakers include Tony Gallippi (CEO, BitPay) and Stephen Pair (CTO, BitPay), Stephen Kinsella (Executive Editor, Libertarian Papers), Doug French (Senior Editor, Laissez Faire Club), Michael Goldstein (Co-Founder, The Mises Circle), Peter Surda (Author, Economics of Bitcoin), Charlie Schrem (CEO, BitInstant), Charles Hoskinson (CEO, Invictus Innovations Incorporated), Daniel Larimer (CTO, Invictus Innovations Incorporated), Cathy Reisenwitz (Writer and Political Commentator, Reason Magazine), Adam B. Levine (Editor in Chief, Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin), Tuur Demeester (Author, MacroTrends), Daniel Krawisz (Libertarian Activist).\nThe evening will conclude with a cocktail reception featuring Austin Craig and Beccy Bingham\u2019s story, \u201cLife on Bitcoin.\u201d Austin and Becky as newlyweds took the challenges of living for 90 days on Bitcoin alone and will share of their journey which is shortly coming to a close.\nIf you are located in the US and specifically the South East, Bitcoin Magazine encourages you to look into attending the 2013 Crypto-Currency Conference in Atlanta, Georgia. Tickets are still available at general and student attendance rates.\u00a0If it doesn\u2019t fit your schedule, Video Passes covering all the talks and content are also available.", "year": 2013, "month": 9, "day": 19}
{"title": "Bitcoin Conference in Amsterdam in Two Weeks", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-conference-in-amsterdam-in-two-weeks-1379177771/", "birthday": "Sep 14, 2013  12:56 PM EST", "date": "2013-09-14 17:56:00", "content": "Conferences have become a big part of the Bitcoin community this year. Over a thousand people came to the Bitcoin conference in San Jose, and nearly every month since then we have seen some kind of Bitcoin event. We had Porcfest in June, BTC London and the Inside Bitcoins conference in July, and the regulatory compliance conference in New York in August. And this month, although it has not been nearly so widely publicized, there will be a Bitcoin conference as well, located in Amsterdam from September 26 to 28. The details for the event can be found on the conference\u2019s website.\nThe organizers of the conference would like the see their event have a somewhat different character from the ones that came before it. \u201cIt\u2019s an open source conference,\u201d explains Matthew Wright, one of the chief organizers behind the event, \u201cit\u2019s not a moneygrab and tap dance of self-importance by those who seek to centralize and \u2018get rich quick'\u201d. The sentiment is common among Bitcoin users in mainland Europe that the Bitcoin community in the US is focusing too heavily on integrating with mainstream finance, securing large profits and investments and, some would add, bending backwards to regulatory authorities to make Bitcoin seem more friendly to established institutions; rather, many Europeans believe, Bitcoin\u2019s potential to bootstrap a grassroots economy should be emphasized. When asked specifically what this anti-corporatist sentiment means in practice, Moe Levin writes:\nWe\u2019re trying to be different. We\u2019ve done market research on attendees and saw that people wanted to see more devs, more entrepreneurs, and more of the people that are not \u201cgetting rich quick\u201d. they want to see people with good ideas, working on them, and succeeding in making the community a better place. We have some big players in the bitcoin community speaking. No getting around that when you want to make a large event and attract attendees, but we\u2019ve moved to invite the people that others can learn from and share experiences with, not the people that are interested in self-promotion. We have rigorous guidelines for speakers and their topics, and have asked for revisions of their speeches if they are too much of an ad for them. Think of it more of a TEDxBitcoin conference than a Bitcoin conference.\nThe conference certainly has plenty of big players inside the Bitcoin community, although the European side dominates to an extent not seen in London or San Jose; Trezor, Bitsofproof, Bex.io, OpenTransactions, BitPay, Coinbase and BitStamp are perhaps the most prominent names on the list. Outside of the Bitcoin community, on the regulatory front the organizers managed to bring in Wieske Ebben, a policy maker from the Dutch National Bank, and Niels Ploeger from the Amsterdam police. The other major non-Bitcoin-specific attendees are likely to come on the entertainment side; Juice Rap News, a group that releases satirical news broadcasts based on current events in a rap style and has received over 200 bitcoins in donations since they first started accepting them, is interested in attending, and Maxmin may come as well.\nWhat is most interesting about what Levin and Wright are doing is actually not the conference itself; in fact, Wright argues, an excessive attention on \u201cconferences\u201d can be counterproductive. \u201cYearly conferences are great for publicity but not very useful in bringing bitcoin to markets,\u201d Wright explains, \u201cIn fact, it works against it by putting it upon a pedestal as if it were some overly complicated technology that needs a conference just to understand\u201d. Rather, the two want to build \u201cmarketplaces\u201d in countries all around the world. \u201cThe future of the bitcoin conferences,\u201d Levin writes. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking Qatar. Montreal. Korea. something lite. A convention, involving people outside of Bitcoin\u201d. These events would take place in each city every month, and would be a hybrid between weekly meetups, Satoshi Square events and traditional conferences; they would be aimed not so much at experienced Bitcoin users discussing theoretical topics in Bitcoin, but rather toward new users interested in learning more about Bitcoin, as well as new and experienced users alike actually using it in real life, and connecting people together to get things done. \u201cWe lead in with a conference/convention,\u201d Wright explains, \u201cbut we leave the groundwork for a monthly marketplace.\u201d\nFor now, though, the only thing that is set in stone is the Amsterdam conference itself; even if Levin and Wright\u2019s more long-term plans fizzle, the conference will still be valuable to the Bitcoin community; in fact, it will be only the second major Bitcoin event ever to happen in mainland Europe, the first being the November 2011 convention in Prague. A considerably number of people will be attending, from both Europe and the United States alike. Hope you can come!", "year": 2013, "month": 9, "day": 14}

As one of the first UK exchanges, IBWT will plan on taking a wait and see approach to how the US market develops before getting involved in USD.\nCurrently IBWT has capped customer account and withdrawal/deposit limits at \u00a31,000. After some time the IBWT team plans to expand customer account limits. While currently having one tier of customers, IBWT hopes to expand tiers to allow for higher value deposits and withdrawals. While gradually increasing customer account and withdrawal limits, IBWT plans to strategically grow as one of the first British cryptocurrency exchanges.\nCurrently, IBWT is not governed by HMRC (Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customers) or FCA (Financial Conduct Authority, recently known as the FSA, Financial Services Authority). However IBWT leadership plans on adhering to any regulatory changes required by the UK government. Working to improve the visibility and credibility of cryptocurrencies and non traditional exchanges, IBWT plans on providing an example of how an exchange can operate within the regulatory framework of the United Kingdom. IBWT will establish a business network of exchanges to further build confidence in cryptocurrency exchanges in the UK and around the world.\nBitcoin Magazine had a chance to take a preview tour of IBWT. Working to set the tone for cryptocurrency achievement, the homepage opens with the following quote by Nikola Tesla, \u201cThe day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.\u201d In response to Nikola Tesla\u2019s quote, IBWT highlights, \u201cOne wonders how applicable Bitcoin is to Nikola Tesla\u2019s statement. Here at IBWT we plan to help put it to the test, by enabling you, our customers, to trade your Bitcoin for sterling with each other in a secure and trusted environment.\u201d\nThe IBWT team intends to provide a more secure platform for transacting Bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies. Security is ensured with Cold Storage, SSL 256-bit encryption & 2FA. In particular IBWT uses a method of enforced (email ToTP) Two Factor Authentication for user account to login to ibwt.co.uk. IBWT customers can also set an extra layer of security, (google authenticator) Time-based One-time Password Algorithm (TOTP) for login, withdrawal/deposits and settings.\nIn addition to serving as a secure exchange, IBWT will work to provide top customer service. To maintain profitability of their site, IBWT will charge only 0.8% per transaction. To avoid a lengthy approval process, IBWT is committed to a simple verification process, meaning one can become a full customer in a matter of days. With a dedicated server for an enhanced customer experience, IBWT hopes to build up customer trust and serve as a convenient yet secure exchange. All deposits and withdrawals run through wire transfers and while services are only available to UK residents to date, IBWT plans on expanding its user base.\nAs the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ecosystem is only as strong as an active userbase, IBWT aims to encourage financial participation in the UK and around the world. With a new Bitcoin and cryptocurrency related exchange in the UK, IBWT will promote cooperative business practices with traditional and non-traditional banks.

Gox USD Withdrawals To Take Up To 22 Months", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/with-current-processes-mt-gox-usd-withdrawals-could-take-22-months-1379739436/", "birthday": "Sep 21, 2013  12:57 AM EST", "date": "2013-09-21 05:57:00", "content": "Since June 2013, the bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has been struck by severe problems with fiat currency withdrawals. According to their press release of June 20th, cash withdrawals would be suspended for 2 weeks. On July 4th, a press release stated that withdrawals had fully resumed. Despite this positive tone, it was shortly noted by the user community that few withdrawals seemed to be occurring in a timely manner. Queries to Mt. Gox support since that time have normally been answered with a statement that it is taking several weeks for withdrawals and to please be patient.\nUnfortunately, as of today, withdrawals of USD via wire transfer are still substantially delayed. Mt. Gox has refused to provide estimates of when these withdrawals might occur. While this has fueled speculation about potential insolvency of Mt. Gox, withdrawals in other currencies appear to be occurring fairly rapidly, with Japanese domestic bank withdrawals often occurring the same day. This argues against the notion of insolvency, but that there is a serious problem with USD withdrawals.\nFortunately, there have been several ongoing threads at bitcointalk.org which permit an estimate of likely delays. On August 29th, user Sturle reported that discussions with Mt. Gox indicated that the processing of international wire transfers \u201chas reached mid June\u201d. Looking backward in this discussion, an earlier report on June 19th stated that a USD wire transfer had been completed from 1 week before. Another user had reported that on June 2nd he was making several transfer requests and would report back. As of August 30th, he had only reported that a transfer from June 16th was still \u201cconfirmed\u201d but not completed. All of these reports suggest that a serious backlog began around June 12th.\nBased on these reports, it would appear that Mt. Gox may have worked from July 4th to August 30th to clear a queue of USD wire transfer requests extending from June 10th (being generous) to June 16th. That is 8 weeks to clear 1 week of the queue of requests. Mt. Gox has stated in both support responses to this author and on IRC that there is a 10 SWIFT transfer per day limit at their bank. So this rate of clearing the queue would imply roughly 80 transfer requests per day being submitted, which seems quite reasonable given an average daily volume of ~$21M. There is uncertainty in these estimates, since there are no reports of completed transactions in \u2018mid June\u2019, just the indirect report of Mt. Gox support. The situation could actually be worse since \u201cmid June\u201d might be June 12th to some.\nWhat does this imply about current requests for withdrawals? There are 12 weeks between mid June and today (September 16th). Thus one would expect a withdrawal request submitted today to be processed in 8 x 12 = 96 weeks, or around June 2015. Now clearly a lot can happen between now and June 2015. Mt. Gox keeps stating that they are working with banking partners and expect things to improve soon. Of course, they\u2019ve been stating that since June.\nWill Mt. Gox be able to establish improved banking relationships? That is unclear. Buttercoin CEO Cedric Dahl stated in an interview with bitcointalk that they had approached 67 different banks attempting to establish a business relationship with a bank for a bitcoin exchange and were unable to do so. The delays in Mt. Gox improving their process also suggest this is a very difficult thing for them to do.\nMt. Gox has unfortunately been opaque regarding these delays. Neither the current delays on USD withdrawals nor the ability to request a quicker \u201cmanual\u201d withdrawal for a 5% fee (though only one of these per day may be allowed) is publicised on their site. Thus a new user of bitcoin might well hear that one can sell them on Mt. Gox, look at relative prices, and proceed to sell there, only to find out many weeks later that their USD are effectively stuck in Mt. Gox.\nHopefully users can now realize just how long their USD may be stuck there.\nDisclosure: The author owns bitcoins and occasionally trades them at Mt. Gox and other exchanges.", "year": 2013, "month": 9, "day": 21}

Whether or not you agree with the conclusions that his partisans draw from that claim, the statement certainly carries a large amount of truth. What is a corporation, after all, but a certain group of people working together under a set of specific rules? When a corporation owns property, what that really means is that there is a legal contract stating that the property can only be used for certain purposes under the control of those people who are currently its board of directors \u2013 a designation itself modifiable by a particular set of shareholder. If a corporation does something, it\u2019s because its board of directors has agreed that it should be done. If a corporation hires employees, it means that the employees are agreeing to provide services to the corporation\u2019s customers under a particular set of rules, particularly involving payment. When a corporation has limited liability, it means that specific people have been granted extra privileges to act with reduced fear of legal prosecution by the government \u2013 a group of people with more rights than ordinary people acting alone, but ultimately people nonetheless. In any case, it\u2019s nothing more than people and contracts all the way down.\nHowever, here a very interesting question arises: do we really need the people? On the one hand, the answer is yes: although in some post-Singularity future machines will be able to survive all on their own, for the forseeable future some kind of human action will simply be necessary to interact with the physical world. On the other hand, however, over the past two hundred years the answer has been increasingly no. The industrial revolution allowed us, for the first time, to start replacing human labor with machines on a large scale, and now we have advanced digitized factories and robotic arms that produce complex goods like automobiles all on their own. But this is only automating the bottom; removing the need for rank and file manual laborers, and replacing them with a smaller number of professionals to maintain the robots, while the management of the company remains untouched. The question is, can we approach the problem from the other direction: even if we still need human beings to perform certain specialized tasks, can we remove the management from the equation instead?\nMost companies have some kind of mission statement; often it\u2019s about making money for shareholders; at other times, it includes some moral imperative to do with the particular product that they are creating, and other goals like helping communities sometimes enter the mix, at least in theory. Right now, that mission statement exists only insofar as the board of directors, and ultimately the shareholders, interpret it. But what if, with the power of modern information technology, we can encode the mission statement into code; that is, create an inviolable contract that generates revenue, pays people to perform some function, and finds hardware for itself to run on, all without any need for top-down human direction?\nAs Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin\u2019s Daniel Larmier pointed out in his own exploration on this concept, in a sense Bitcoin itself can be thought of as a very early prototype of exactly such a thing. Bitcoin has 21 million shares, and these shares are owned by what can be considered Bitcoin\u2019s shareholders. It has employees, and it has a protocol for paying them: 25 BTC to one random member of the workforce roughly every ten minutes. It even has its own marketing department, to a large extent made up of the shareholders themselves. However, it is also very limited. It knows almost nothing about the world except for the current time, it has no way of changing any aspect of its function aside from the difficulty, and it does not actually do anything per se; it simply exists, and leaves it up to the world to recognize it. The question is: can we do better?\nComputation\nThe first challenge is obvious: how would such a corporation actually make any decisions? It\u2019s easy to write code that, at least given predictable environments, takes a given input and calculates a desired action to take. But who is going to run the code? If the code simply exists as a computer program on some particular machine, what is stopping the owner of that machine from shutting the whole thing down, or even modifying its code to make it send all of its money to himself? To this problem, there is only one effective answer: distributed computing.\nHowever, the kind of distributed computing that we are looking for here is not the same as the distributed computing in projects like SETI@home and Folding@home; in those cases, there is still a central server collecting data from the distributed nodes and sending out requests. Here, rather, we need the kind of distributed computing that we see in Bitcoin: a set of rules that decentrally self-validates its own computation. In Bitcoin, this is accomplished by a simple majority vote: if you are not helping to compute the blockchain with the majority network power, your blocks will get discarded and you will get no block reward. The theory is that no single attacker will have enough computer power to subvert this mechanism, so the only viable strategy is essentially to \u201cgo with the flow\u201d and act honestly to help support the network and receive one\u2019s block reward. So can we simply apply this mechanism to decentralized computation? That is, can we simply ask every computer in the network to evaluate a program, and then reward only those whose answer matches the majority vote? The answer is, unfortunately, no. Bitcoin is a special case because Bitcoin is simple: it is just a currency, carrying no property or private data of its own. A virtual corporation, on the other hand, would likely need to store the private key to its Bitcoin wallet \u2013 a piece of data which should be available in its entirety to no one, not to everyone in the way that Bitcoin transactions are. But, of course, the private key must still be usable. Thus, what we need is some system of signing transactions, and even generating Bitcoin addresses, that can be computed in a decentralized way. Fortunately, Bitcoin allows us to do exactly that.\nThe first solution that might immediately come to mind is multisignature addresses; given a set of a thousand computers that can be relied upon to probably continue supporting the corporations, have each of them create a private key, and generate a 501-of-1000 multisignature address between them. To spend the funds, simply construct a transaction with signatures from any 501 nodes and broadcast it into the blockchain. The problem here is obvious: the transaction would be too large. Each signature makes up about seventy bytes, so 501 of them would make a 35 KB transaction \u2013 which is very difficult to get accepted into the network as bitcoind by default refuses transactions with any script above 10,000 bytes. Second, the solution is specific to Bitcoin; if the corporation wants to store private data for non-financial purposes, multisignature scripts are useless. Multisignature addresses work because there is a Bitcoin network evaluating them, and placing transactions into the blockchain depending on whether or not the evaluation succeeds. In the case of private data, an analogous solution would essentially require some decentralized authority to store the data and give it out only if a request has 501 out of 1000 signatures as needed \u2013 putting us right back where we started.\nHowever, there is still hope in another solution; the general name given to this by cryptographers is \u201csecure multiparty computation\u201d. In secure multiparty computation, the inputs to a program (or, more precisely, the inputs to a simulated \u201ccircuit\u201d, as secure multiparty computation cannot handle \u201cif\u201d statements and conditional looping) are split up using an algorithm called Shamir\u2019s Secret Sharing, and a piece of the information is given to each participant. Shamir\u2019s Secret Sharing can be used to split up any data into N pieces such that any K of them, but no K-1 of them, are sufficient to recover the original data \u2013 you choose what K and N are when running the algorithm. 2-of-3, 5-of-10 and 501-of-1000 are all possible. A circuit can then be evaluated on the pieces of data in a decentralized way, such that at the end of the computation everyone has a piece of the result of the computation, but at no point during the computation does any single individual get even the slightest glimpse of what is going on. Finally, the pieces are put together to reveal the result. The runtime of the algorithm is O(n3), meaning that the number of computational steps that it takes to evaluate a computation is roughly proportional to the cube of the number of participants; at 10 nodes, 1000 computational steps, and at 1000 nodes 1 billion steps. A simple billion-step loop in C++ takes about twenty seconds on my own laptop, and servers can do it in a fraction of a second, so 1000 nodes is currently roughly at the limit of computational practicality.\nAs it turns out, secure multiparty computation can be used to generate Bitcoin addresses and sign transactions. For address generation, the protocol is simple:\nEveryone generates a random number as a private key.Everyone calculates the public key corresponding to the private key.Everyone reveals their public key, and uses Shamir\u2019s Secret Sharing algorithm to calculate a public key that can be reconstructed from any 501 of the thousand public keys revealed.An address is generated from that public key.\nBecause public keys can be added, subtracted , multiplied and even divided by integers, surprisingly this algorithm works exactly as you would expect. If everyone were to then put together a 501-of-1000 private key in the same way, that private key would be able to spend the money sent to the address generated by applying the 501-of-1000 algorithm to the corresponding public keys. This works because Shamir\u2019s Secret Sharing is really just an algebraic formula \u2013 that is to say, it uses only addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, and one can compute this formula \u201cover\u201d public keys just as easily as with addresses; as a result, it doesn\u2019t matter if the private key to public key conversion is done before the algebra or after it. Signing transactions can be done in a similar way, although the process is somewhat more complicated.\nThe beauty of secure multiparty computation is that it extends beyond just Bitcoin; it can just as easily be used to run the artificial intelligence algorithm that the corporation relies on to operate. So-called \u201cmachine learning\u201d, the common name for a set of algorithms that detect patterns in real-world data and allow computers to model it without human intervention and are employed heavily in fields like spam filters and self-driving cars, is also \u201cjust algebra\u201d, and can be implemented in secure multiparty computation as well. Really, any computation can, if that computation is broken down into a circuit on the input\u2019s individual bits. There is naturally some limit to the complexity that is possible; converting complex algorithms into circuits often introduces additional complexity, and, as described above, Shamir\u2019s Secret Sharing can get expensive all by itself. Thus, it should only really be used to implement the \u201ccore\u201d of the algorithm; more complex high-level thinking tasks are best resolved by outside contractors.\nExcited about this topic? Look forward to parts 2, 3 and 4: how decentralized corporations can interact with the outside world, how some simple secure multiparty computation circuits work on a mathematical level, and two examples of how these decentralized corporations can make a difference in the real world.", "year": 2013, "month": 9, "day": 20}

As it turns out, these networks can even maintain a Bitcoin balance, and send and receive transactions. These two capacities: the capacity to think, and the capacity to maintain capital, are in theory all that an economic agent needs to survive in the marketplace, provided that its thoughts and capital allow it to create sellable value fast enough to keep up with its own resource demands. In practice, however, one major challenge still remains: how to actually interact with the world around them.\nGetting Data\nThe first of the two major challenges in this regard is that of input \u2013 how can a decentralized corporation learn any facts about the real world? It is certainly possible for a decentralized corporation to exist without facts, at least in theory; a computing network might have the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory axioms embedded into it right from the start and then embark upon an infinite loop proving all possible mathematical theorems \u2013 although in practice even such a system would need to somehow know what kinds of theorems the world finds interesting; otherwise, we may simply learn that a+b=b+a, a+b+c=c+b+a, a+b+c+d=d+c+b+a and so on. On the other hand, a corporation that has some data about what people want, and what resources are available to obtain it, would be much more useful to the world at large.\nHere we must make a distinction between two kinds of data: self-verifying data, and non-self-verifying data. Self-verifying data is data which, once computed on in a certain way, in some sense \u201cproves\u201d its own validity. For example, if a given decentralized corporation is looking for prime numbers containing the sequence \u2018123456789\u2019, then one can simply feed in \u201812345678909631\u2019 and the corporation can computationally verify that the number is indeed prime. The current temperature in Berlin, on the other hand, is not self-verifying at all; it could be 11\u2019C, but it could also just as easily be 17\u2019C, or even 231\u2019C; without outside data, all three values seem equally legitimate.\nBitcoin is an interesting case to look at. In the Bitcoin system, transactions are partially self-verifying. The concept of a \u201ccorrectly signed\u201d transaction is entirely self-verifying; if the transaction\u2019s signature passes the elliptic curve digital signature verification algorithm, then the transaction is valid. In theory, you might claim that the transaction\u2019s signature correctness depends on the public key in the previous transaction; however, this actually does not at all detract from the self-verification property \u2013 the transaction submitter can always be required to submit the previous transaction as well. However, there is something that is not self-verifying: time. A transaction cannot spend money before that money was received and, even more crucially, a transaction cannot spend money that has already been spent. Given two transactions spending the same money, either one could have theoretically come first; there is no way to self-verify the validity of one history over the other.\nBitcoin essentially solves the time problem with a computational democracy. If the majority of the network agrees that events happened in a certain order, then that order is taken as truth, and the incentive is for every participant in this democratic process to participate honestly; if any participant does not, then unless the rogue participant has more computing power than the rest of the network put together his own version of the history will always be a minority opinion, and thus rejected, depriving the miscreant of their block revenue.\nIn a more general case, the fundamental idea that we can gleam from the blockchain concept is this: we can use some kind of resource-democracy mechanism to vote on the correct value of some fact, and ensure that people are incentivized to provide accurate estimates by depriving everyone whose report does not match the \u201cmainstream view\u201d of the monetary reward. The question is, can this same concept be applied elsewhere as well? One improvement to Bitcoin that many would like to see, for example, is a form of price stabilization; if Bitcoin could track its own price in terms of other currencies or commodities, for example, the algorithm could release more bitcoins if the price is high and fewer if the price is low \u2013 naturally stabilizing the price and reducing the massive spikes that the current system experiences. However, so far, no one has yet figured out a practical way of accomplishing such a thing. But why not?\nThe answer is one of precision. It is certainly possible to design such a protocol in theory: miners can put their own view of what the Bitcoin price is in each block, and an algorithm using that data could fetch it by taking the median of the last thousand blocks. Miners that are not within some margin of the median would be penalized. However, the problem is that the miners have every incentive, and substantial wiggle room, to commit fraud. The argument is this: suppose that the actual Bitcoin price is 114 USD, and you, being a miner with some substantial percentage of network power (eg. 5%), know that there is a 99.99% chance that 113 to 115 USD will be inside the safe margin, so if you report a number within that range your blocks will not get rejected. What should you say that the Bitcoin price is? The answer is, something like 115 USD. The reason is that if you put your estimate higher, the median that the network provides might end up being 114.05 BTC instead of 114 BTC, and the Bitcoin network will use this information to print more money \u2013 increasing your own future revenue in the process at the expense of existing savers. Once everyone does this, even honest miners will feel the need to adjust their estimates upwards to protect their own blocks from being rejected for having price reports that are too low. At that point, the cycle repeats: the price is 114 USD, you are 99.99% sure that 114 to 116 USD will be within the safe margin, so you put down the answer of 116 USD. One cycle after that, 117 USD, then 118 USD, and before you know it the entire network collapses in a fit of hyperinflation.\nThe above problem arose specifically from two facts: first, there is a range of acceptable possibilities with regard to what the price is and, second, the voters have an incentive to nudge the answer in one direction. If, instead of proof of work, proof of stake was used (ie. one bitcoin = one vote instead of one clock cycle = one vote), then the opposite problem would emerge: everyone would bid the price down since stakeholders do not want any new bitcoins to be printed at all. Can proof of work and proof of stake perhaps be combined to somehow solve the problem? Maybe, maybe not.\nThere is also another potential way to resolve this problem, at least for applications that are higher-level than the underying currency: look not at reported market prices, but at actual market prices. Assume, for example, that there already exists a system like Ripple (or perhaps something based on colored coins) that includes a decentralized exchange between various cryptographic assets. Some might be contracts representing assets like gold or US dollars, others company shares, others smart property and there would obviously also be trust-free cryptocurrency similar to Bitcoin as well. Thus, in order to defraud the system, malicious participants would not simply need to report prices that are slightly incorrect in their favored direction, but would need to push the actual prices of these goods as well \u2013 essentially, a LIBOR-style price fixing conspiracy. And, as the experiences of the last few years have shown, LIBOR-style price fixing conspiracies are something that even human-controlled systems cannot necessarily overcome.\nFurthermore, this fundamental weakness that makes it so difficult to capture accurate prices without a crypto-market is far from universal. In the case of prices, there is definitely much room for corruption \u2013 and the above does not even begin to describe the full extent of corruption possible. If we expect Bitcoin to last much longer than individual fiat currencies, for example, we might want the currency generation algorithm to be concerned with Bitcoin\u2019s price in terms of commodities, and not individual currencies like the USD, leaving the question of exactly which commodities to use wide open to \u201cinterpretation\u201d. However, in most other cases no such problems exist. If we want a decentralized database of weather in Berlin, for example, there is no serious incentive to fudge it in one direction or the other. Technically, if decentralized corporations started getting into crop insurance this would change somewhat, but even there the risk would be smaller, since there wowuld be two groups pulling in opposite directions (namely, farmers who want to pretend that there are droughts, and insurers who want to pretend that there are not). Thus, a decentralized weather network is, even with the technology of today, an entirely possible thing to create.\nActing On The World\nWith some kind of democratic voting protocol, we reasoned above, it\u2019s possible for a decentralized corporation to learn facts about the world. However, is it also possible to do the opposite? Is it possible for a corporation to actually influence its environment in ways more substantial than just sitting there and waiting for people to assign value to its database entries as Bitcoin does? The answer is yes, and there are several ways to accomplish the goal. The first, and most obvious, is to use APIs. An API, or application programming interface, is an interface specifically designed to allow computer programs to interact with a particular website or other software program. For example, sending an HTTP GET request to http://blockchain.info/address/1AEZyM6pXy1gxiqVsRLFENJLhDjbCj4FJz?format=json sends an instruction to blockchain.info\u2019s servers, which then give you back a file containing the latest transactions to and from the Bitcoin address 1AEZyM6pXy1gxiqVsRLFENJLhDjbCj4FJz in a computer-friendly format. Over the past ten years, as business has increasingly migrated onto the internet, the number of services that are accessible by API has been rapidly increasing. We have internet search, weather, online forums, stock trading, and more APIs are being created every year. With Bitcoin, we have one of the most critical pieces of all: an API for money.\nHowever, there still remains one critical, and surprisingly mundane, problem: it is currently impossible to send an HTTP request in a decentralized way. The request must eventually be sent to the server all in one piece, and that means that it must be assembled in its entirety, somewhere. For requests whose only purpose is to retrieve public data, like the blockchain query described above, this is not a serious concern; the problem can be solved with a voting protocol. However, if the API requires a private API key to access, as all APIs that automate activities like purchasing resources necessarily do, having the private key appear in its entirety, in plaintext, anywhere but at the final recipient, immediately compromises the private key\u2019s privacy. Requiring requests to be signed alleviates this problem; signatures, as we saw above, can be done in a decentralized way, and signed requests cannot be tampered with. However, this requires additional effort on the part of API developers to accomplish, and so far we are nowhere near adopting signed API requests as a standard.\nEven with that issue solved, another issue still remains. Interacting with an API is no challenge for a computer program to do; however, how does the program learn about that API in the first place? How does it handle the API changing? What about the corporation running a particular API going down outright, and others coming in to take its place? What if the API is removed, and nothing exists to replace it? Finally, what if the decentralized corporation needs to change its own source code? These are problems that are much more difficult for computers to solve. To this, there is only one answer: rely on humans for support. Bitcoin heavily relies on humans to keep it alive; we saw in March 2013 how a blockchain fork required active intervention from the Bitcoin community to fix, and Bitcoin is one of the most stable decentralized computing protocols that can possibly be designed. Even if a 51% attack happens, a blockchain fork splits the network into three, and a DDoS takes down the five major mining pools all at the same time, once the smoke clears some blockchain is bound to come out ahead, the miners will organize around it, and the network will simply keep on going from there. More complex corporations are going to be much more fragile; if a money-holding network somehow leaks its private keys, the result is that it goes bankrupt.\nBut how can humans be used without trusting them too much? If the humans in question are only given highly specific tasks that can easily be measured, like building the fastest possible miner, then there is no issue. However, the tasks that humans will need to do are precisely those tasks that cannot so easily be measured; how do you figure out how much to reward someone for discovering a new API? Bitcoin solves the problem by simply removing the complexity by going up one layer of abstraction: Bitcoin\u2019s shareholders benefit if the price goes up, so shareholders are encouraged to do things that increase the price. In fact, in the case of Bitcoin an entire quasi-religion has formed around supporting the protocol and helping it grow and gain wider adoption; it\u2019s hard to imagine every corporation having anything close to such a fervent following.\nHostile Takeovers\nAlongside the \u201cfuture proofing\u201d problem, there is also another issue that needs to be dealt with: that of \u201chostile takeovers\u201d. This is the equivalent of a 51% attack in the case of Bitcoin, but the stakes are higher. A hostile takeover of a corporation handling money means that the attacker gains the ability to drain the corporation\u2019s entire wallet. A hostile takeover of Decentralized Dropbox, Inc means that the attacker can read everyone\u2019s files (although hopefully the files are encrypted, although in the case the attacker can still deny everyone their files). A hostile takeover of a decentralized web hosting company can lead to massive losses not just for those who have websites hosted, but also their customers, as the attacker gains the ability to modify web pages to also send off customers\u2019 private data to the attacker\u2019s own server as soon as each customer logs in. How might a hostile takeover be accomplished? In the case of the 501-out-of-1000 private key situation, the answer is simple: pretend to be a few thousand different servers at the same time, and join the corporation with all of them. By forwarding communications through millions of computers infected by a botnet, this is easy to accomplish without being detected. Then, once you have more than half of the servers in the network, you can immediately proceed to cash out.\nFortunately, the presence of Bitcoin has created a number of solutions, of which the proof of work used by Bitcoin itself is only one. Because Bitcoin is a perfect API for money, any kind of protocol involving monetary scarcity and incentives is now available for computer networks to use. Proof of stake, requiring each participating node to show proof that it controls, say, 100 BTC is one possible solution; if that is done, then implementing a hostile takeover would require more resources than all of the legitimate nodes committed together. The 100 BTC could even be moved to a multisignature address partially controlled by the network as a surety bond, both discouraging nodes from cheating and giving their owners a great incentive to act and even get together to keep the corporation alive.\nAnother alternative might simply be to allow the decentralized corporation to have shareholders, so that shareholders get some kind of special voting privileges, along with the right to a share of the profits, in exchange for investing; this too would encourage the shareholders to protect their investment. Making a more fine-grained evaluation of an individual human employee is likely impossible; the best solution is likely to simply use monetary incentives to direct people\u2019s actions on a coarse level, and then let the community self-organize to make the fine-grained adjustments. The extent to which a corporation targets a community for investment and participation, rather than discrete individuals, is the choice of its original developers. On the one hand, targeting a community can allow your human support to work together to solve problems in large groups. On the other hand, keeping everyone separate prevents collusion, and in that way reduces the likelihood of a hostile takeover.\nThus, what we have seen here is that very significant challenges still remain before any kind of decentralized corporation can be viable. The problem will likely be solved in layers. First, with the advent of Bitcoin, a self-supporting layer of cryptographic money exists. Next, with Ripple and colored coins, we will see crypto-markets emerge, that can then be used to provide crypto-corporations with accurate price data. At the same time, we will see more and more crypto-friendly APIs emerge to serve decentralized systems\u2019 needs. Such APIs will be necessary regardless of whether decentralized corporations will ever exist; we see today just how difficult cryptographic keys are to keep secure, so infrastructure suitable for multiparty signing will likely become a necessity. Large certificate signing authorities, for example, hold private keys that would result in hundreds of millions of dollars worth of security breaches if they were ever to fall into the wrong hands, and so these organizations often employ some form of multiparty signing already.\nFinally, it will still take time for people to develop exactly how these decentralized corporations would work. Computer software is increasingly becoming the single most important building block of our modern world, but up until now search into the area has been focused on two areas: artificial intelligence, software working purely on its own, and software tools working under human beings. The question is: is there something in the middle? If there is, the idea of software directing humans, the decentralized corporation, is exactly that. Contrary to fears, this would not be an evil heartless robot imposing an iron fist on humanity; in fact, the tasks that the corporation will need to outsource are precisely those that require the most human freedom and creativity. Let\u2019s see if it\u2019s possible.\nSupplementary reading: Jeff Garzik\u2019s article on one practical example of what an autonomous corporation might be useful for", "year": 2013, "month": 9, "day": 22}

I had heard of BitPay a couple of years ago as a possible payment solution, but didnt look into it. There were plenty of payment systems available, and I didnt see the need to add another one. Im definitely not an early adopter of technologies I tend to wait and see how they develop. For products, there\u2019s usually a good price drop as well if you are willing to wait.\nThen about 6 months ago, in a forum for the software I deal with someone pointed out accepting bitcoin again, and I took a deeper look. Soon after that the media started talking about it and suddenly interest really shot up. I asked the software vendor to add taking bitcoin to their release schedule.

{"title": "Boost VC Startups Complete Accelerator Session at Demo Day 2013", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/boost-vc-startups-complete-accelerator-session-2013-1379893469/", "birthday": "Sep 22, 2013  7:44 PM EST", "date": "2013-09-23 00:44:00", "content": "The very first, largely Bitcoin-focused startup accelerator session wrapped-up on Thursday with a remarkable event that the founders at Boost VC call Demo Day, a high-stakes mashup of final exam and graduation for the 17 fresh companies that were chosen to participate. Seven of the attending startups in the concluding summer session have created products that use Bitcoin in a wide variety of manner. With the course coming to an end, all seven Bitcoin companies have received a $50,000 investment in addition to the countless other benefits, both valuable and priceless, that have come from three months of living and breathing hard work under the guidance and with the motivation of professional, experienced mentors in the center of Silicon Valley. Demo Day is the last chance to shine for these burgeoning companies before leaving the purview of Boost, hopefully with clear direction in mind and solid investments in hand.\nAdam Draper, Boost CEO, greeted the sharply dressed investors and other invited guests at the clubhouse doors of the posh Menlo Circus Club in Menlo Park, California. Perhaps it was the beautiful, breezy, clear day that caught everybody in a good mood at the swanky equestrian club in the late summer afternoon or maybe it was the impending opportunity to make some serious money while getting an early jump on the next hot new thing; be it Bitcoin, 3D printing or any other disruptive technologies to catch the attention of Draper and co-founder Brayton Williams. While the 200+ attending guests arrived, delicious hors d\u2019oeuvres circulated through the anxious crowd of mingling young entrepreneurs and the eager audience took their seats for a lightning round of 4-minute pitch presentations.\nTo commence the function Draper introduced the summer 2013 session participants as \u201cno-shoe wearing, Bitcoin loving, product hacking entrepreneurs\u201d with evident joy and pride before asking, \u201cWho are we?\u201d to which the group shouted back, \u201cBoost!\u201d The camaraderie and support that has come from living and working together for months on end is evident as the pitches got underway.\nThe first company to present was the winner of the Bitcoin 2013 Hackathon in San Jose last May, BitWall. With the spotlight that Boost shines on pitching to investors, Nic Meliones, CEO of BitWall, had an edge at the Hackathon with his never-yielding, confident energy that was evident once again as he took the mic and outlined BitWall\u2019s mission to monetize web content with micropayments and revolutionize the way publishers get paid and consumers get content.\n\u201cWhen a publisher is using BitWall they are able to accept payments as low as one cent, approximately. We make this possible by leveraging Bitcoin as the payment technology running through BitWall.\u201d Meliones explained, using an early client, ZeroBlock, as an example, \u201cWhen a consumer signs in for BitWall, they of course has access to ZeroBlock but they also have access to every publisher in the BitWall network. No longer do consumers have to sign in or sign up for every one of their favorite publishers. There is too much friction and the results show it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\nIn anticipation of the fact that many of the important attendees would likely be unfamiliar with Bitcoin, the printed program which was distributed at the door featured a brief introduction in the form of a couple of paragraphs on the back. Although this obviously is not enough information to understand Bitcoin, printed material frequently proves helpful in cushioning the information overload that may occur when introducing someone to digital currency. This is certainly valuable in an investment environment in which over 40% of the opportunities of the day are products that use said mind-blowing innovation while rallying for global change through cryptography and decentralization.\nThere were certainly notable startups among the Boost summer teams aside from the Bitcoin seven. The second brand pitched on Demo Day was Feastly, a web-based company that connects home chefs with hungry foodies looking for an alternative to local restaurant options. Feastly wasn\u2019t alone in the food space at Boost as they were accompanied by Battr, a curated recipe website with invite-only chefs and top-quality photography that certainly outshines typical Internet food porn.\nThe second Bitcoin-related pitch was delivered by Kinnard Hockenhull, BitBox founder, who started by briefly explaining the importance of Bitcoin before presenting the audience with his vision, \u201cWe want to be vertically integrated into this new economy. In short, we want to be the bridge from the old economy to the new economy. There\u2019s a huge problem: There is no good way to trade bitcoins in the United States. That\u2019s where we come in. We\u2019re tackling that problem with a U.S. based exchange.\u201d He continued, \u201cWe\u2019ve worked very hard to build an exchange that is secure, compliant, based in the United States with an enjoyable user experience.\u201d\nBitBox is not a lone wolf tackling the present exchange problem in the United States. Vaurum founder Avish Bhama is employing his professional background in high-frequency financial trading to approach the same problem from a different angle, as he described at the start of his pitch, \u201cRight now, the way people access Bitcoin is completely foreign to the way they would normally access any other stock or ETF or any other financial product. Companies in the space are asking you, a mainstream consumer audience, to learn about this really technical product from some random service online that you have probably never heard of. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to learn about Bitcoin from a financial institution that you already know, trust and do business with? That\u2019s where Vaurum comes in. We\u2019ve built a cryptocurrency exchange for financial institutions. Imagine being able to log into your E*TRADE account and buy and sell bitcoin just as easily as you would buy and sell any other stock or ETF. What we\u2019re building here today is going to be the engine to help power Bitcoin\u2019s adoption by the financial institutions.\u201d\nBitPagos is a startup that is unique among its peers at Boost in that the initial target market is outside of the United States, founder Sebastian Serrano presented his plan to help drive Bitcoin adoption in his home country, Argentina, \u201cAt BitPagos we have built a payment gateway that processes credit cards in U.S. dollars but rather than paying out in the local currency we pay out in bitcoins.\u201d He continued, \u201cWe are going first to the hotel and travel industry because it\u2019s the largest use case for e-commerce and we are going first to Argentina because it\u2019s the country with the fastest adoption of Bitcoin \u2026 but we are not stopping there.\u201d\nAndy and August Zinsser, co-founders of Arbiter, also have a very specific target industry in mind with their product which introduces betting to video games in the form of an API for game developers which allows players to place wagers in any game using Bitcoin. The brothers are originally from Las Vegas and have experience developing video games. Andy kicked off the pitch explaining the inspiration for their innovative software, \u201cYou get to the point where bragging rights just don\u2019t mean anything any more. I want more. I want to put money on the line so that the next time I win, I actually win something.\u201d\nIn contrast to the niche target of some of the other Boost Bitcoin companies stands VerifyBTC which harnesses the authentication and P2P properties of Bitcoin. Presenting on behalf of the three founders, engineers who met at University California, Berkeley, Manoj Das painted the bigger picture, \u201cWe are focusing on the Bitcoin market right now but our technology has applications in other sectors within the financial industry, like online lending, brokerage, banking.\u201d\nGliph was the last Bitcoin startup to take the stage and started with a bang by claiming to be \u201cthe World\u2019s easiest way to use Bitcoin.\u201d Presenting founder Rob Banagale continued, \u201cI\u2019ll begin by looking at the problem. If you have used Bitcoin before then you know that the experience is something like this: You have got to deal with these Bitcoin wallet addresses. This long, gangling set of letters and numbers. I mean, you have to copy and paste this. It\u2019s worse than using PayPal.\u201d Banagale then proceeded to send one bitcoin to Adam Draper who stood in the back of the room, with a single tap of his finger on his smartphone. Draper acknowledged that he received the transfer and the two played at whether or not the 1BTC would be returned after the presentation.\nThe very last pitch of the day was not a Bitcoin company, per se, but deserves an honorable mention based solely on the awesomeness of the product. Dreambox started the Boost program in June with a vending machine that produces 3d-printed objects upon command. Since then, things have gotten even more interesting as they have created a full-body 3d scanner which, when combined with the aforementioned 3d-printing vending machine, creates full-color replicas of whatever you put inside of it.\nBy a measure of raised-hands in the room, the eager investors quickly illustrated that many technology-lovers would jump at the opportunity to be scanned and replicated, albeit in a tiny, unanimated form (for now) and Bitcoin-enthusiast Tim Draper is no different. Earlier this summer, presumably as one of the first subjects for the twenty first century art/tech project, Draper stood for the 3-minutes scan and accompanying 5-minute pitch. The outcome is a modern marvel. For other cutting-edge tech fans who wish to be immortalized in 3d wonder, the Dreambox will be on interactive display at the Exploratorium in San Francisco in the coming weeks, for free.\nEntrepreneurs may want to take note of some of the similarities between the 17 4-minute lightning pitches delivered by trained professionals. The young companies had actually practiced a week prior to Demo Day by pitching to a group of Japanese investors. There was overall agreement that this proved valuable in refining the presentations for the domestic investors on this big day. In pursuit of the opportunity to break the ice and land an introduction between founder and financially-interested third-party with capital, each company took time in their presentation to introduce the members of their team along with credentials while vouching for her/his abilities and contributions. Of course, no business presentation is complete without a slideshow with charts and large numbers to illustrate brand growth, traction, market volume, and so on.\nPromptly after Dreambox finished their pitch the crowd dispersed between the two large rooms that were again filled with snacks and drinks. The casual atmosphere of the Menlo Circus Club in the afternoon certainly helped lighten the load of the conversations that ensued between nervous, still on-the-spot, entrepreneurs and important Silicon Valley investors sporting name tags that clearly state, \u201cAngel.\u201d\nThough this marks the end of the first heavily-Bitcoin startup accelerator session it is certainly not the last such opportunity from Boost, at least. It would be nice to see more startup accelerators take note, get on-board and begin bringing in groups of Bitcoin companies to their programs. Now, the Bitcoin economy will likely see the ripple effect that accelerators have on business and finance as these seven Bitcoin companies go forth with their brands into the new, rapidly-growing, global digital currency marketplace.\nThe next session at Boost starts November 4th with a deadline to apply by October 11th.\nRead more about the seven Bitcoin startups and their summer experience at Boost VC in Bitcoin Magazine issue #14.\nFounders and investors meetup after the pitches with gourmet pizza and spirits.", "year": 2013, "month": 9, "day": 23}

In Bitcoin We Trust (IBWT)will initially be working with Bitcoin, potentially expanding to encompass Litecoin and other viable digital currencies as time goes on. This UK based exchange will accept GBP to date and plans on expanding to accept euros. As one of the first UK exchanges, IBWT will plan on taking a wait and see approach to how the US market develops before getting involved in USD.\nIBWT serves as the United Kingdom\u2019s only virtual currency exchanged solely handling Bitcoin. Fully verified services currently only available to UK residents and individuals with a UK bank account. IBWT has capped customer account and withdrawal/deposit limits at \u00a31,000. After some time the IBWT team plans to expand customer account limits. While currently having one tier of customers, IBWT hopes to expand tiers to allow for higher value deposits and withdrawals. While gradually increasing customer account and withdrawal limits, IBWT plans to strategically grow as one of the first British cryptocurrency exchanges.\nIBWT uses the Faster Payments system within the UK, allowing wire transfers (deposits/withdrawals), once cleared, to be processed within 2 hours, excluding weekends. Additionally, to protect the privacy of customers, unverified customers can use almost all services, deposit/withdraw bitcoins and trade on the trading platform. Verified customers can also deposit and withdraw fiat GDP.\nCurrently, IBWT is not governed by HMRC (Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customers) or FCA (Financial Conduct Authority, recently known as the FSA, Financial Services Authority). However IBWT leadership plans on adhering to any regulatory changes required by the UK government. Working to improve the visibility and credibility of cryptocurrencies and non traditional exchanges, IBWT plans on providing an example of how an exchange can operate within the regulatory framework of the United Kingdom. IBWT will establish a business network of exchanges to further build confidence in cryptocurrency exchanges in the UK and around the world.\nThe IBWT team intends to provide a more secure platform for transacting Bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies. Security is ensured with Cold Storage, SSL 256-bit encryption & 2FA. In particular IBWT uses a method of enforced (email ToTP) Two Factor Authentication for user account to login to ibwt.co.uk. IBWT customers can also set an extra layer of security, (google authenticator) Time-based One-time Password Algorithm (TOTP) for login, withdrawal/deposits and settings.\nIn addition to serving as a secure exchange, IBWT will work to provide top customer service. To maintain profitability of their site, IBWT will charge only 0.8% per transaction. To avoid a lengthy approval process, IBWT is committed to a simple verification process, meaning one can become a full customer in a matter of days. With a dedicated server for an enhanced customer experience, IBWT hopes to build up customer trust and serve as a convenient yet secure exchange. All deposits and withdrawals run through wire transfers and while services are only available to UK residents to date, IBWT plans on expanding its user base.\nAs the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ecosystem is only as strong as an active userbase, IBWT aims to encourage financial participation in the UK and around the world. With a new Bitcoin and cryptocurrency related exchange in the UK, IBWT will promote cooperative business practices with traditional and non-traditional banks. Bitcoin Magazine encourages readers in the UK to check out In Bitcoin We Trust.

However, there is still one question that we have not answered: what might such corporations be useful for? Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik once suggested that one application migh be a sort of decentralized Dropbox, where users can upload their files to a resilient peer-to-peer network that would be incentivized to keep those files reliably backed up. But aside from this particular example, what other applications might there be? What are the industries where decentralized corporations will not simply be a gimiick, but will rather be able to survive on their own merits and provide genuine value to society?\nArguably, there are three major categories where this is the case. First, there are the natural monopolies. For certain kinds of services, it simply makes no sense to have many hundreds of competing offerings all working at the same time; software protocols, languages and to some extent social networks and currencies all fit into this model. However, if the providers of these services are not held in check by a competitive market, the question is, who does hold them in check? Who ensures that they charge a fair market price for their services, and do not set monopoly prices thousands of times above what the product actually costs to produce? A decentralized corporation can theoretically be designed so that no one involved in the price-setting mechanism has any such incentive. More generally, decentralized corporations can be made invulnerable to corruption in ways unimaginable in human-controlled system, although great care would certainly need to be taken not to introduce other vulnerabilities instead; Bitcoin itself is a perfect example of this.\nSecond, there are services that violate government laws and regulations; the use of decentralized file-sharing networks for copyright infringement, and to a much lesser extent the use of Bitcoin on sites like Silk Road, are both examples. As Satoshi Nakamoto put it, \u201cGovernments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.\u201d Finally, there are those cases where a decentralized network can simply maintain itself more efficiently and provides better services than any centralized alternative; the peer-to-peer network used by Blizzard to distribute updates to its massively multiplayer online game World of Warcraft is perhaps one of the purest examples.\nThe rest of this article will outline one particular idea for a decentralized corporation that can potentially open up a number of new possibilities in cryptocurrency, creating designs that have vastly different properties from the cryptocurrencies we see today while still staying close to the cryptocurrency ideal. The basic concept is this: Identity Corp, a corporation whose sole purpose is to create cryptographically secure identity documents for individuals that they could sign messages with, and are linked to individuals\u2019 physical identities.\nWhat\u2019s The Point?\nAt first, the idea of creating yet another way to track people\u2019s identity seems silly. Here we are, having escaped the shackles of state-backed fiat currency and its onerous anti-money-laundering identity verification requirements and gotten into the semi-anonymous world of Bitcoin, and I\u2019m suggesting that we bring identity verification right back to the table? But of course, the choice between \u201cnymity\u201d and anonymity is not nearly quite so simple. Even individuals facing potential lifetime imprisonment, such as Silk Road founder Dread Pirate Roberts, still tend to maintain some kind of identity \u2013 in the aforementioned case, the identity is \u201cDread Pirate Roberts\u201d itself. Why does he (or perhaps she, we may never know) do that? The answer is simple: he is also running a multimillion dollar business \u2013 namely, the online anonymous marketplace Silk Road, and he needs to provide customers some reassurance that he can be trusted. Legal and even semi-legal businesses often show themselves in public, deliberately making themselves vulnerable to both government prosecution and harassment of varying degrees from disaffected customers. Why do that? To show to the world that they now have an extra incentive to act honestly. The \u201ccrypto\u201d in cryptography does come from the Greek word for hiding, but in reality cryptography is often about verifying your identity as it is about concealing it.\nHowever, the sort of \u201cidentity\u201d used by Dread Pirate Roberts is different from the identity we are talking about here. The function of standard public key cryptographic identity is a limited one: to provide proof that two messages were created (or at least signed) by the same entity. This definition may seem strange at first; usually, we think of identities as determining \u201cwho someone is\u201d. In reality, however, just like in the principle of relativity in physics, in the context of identity and reputation theory there is no \u201cpreferred frame\u201d for determining which set of observations of a person constitute that core person, or if a person has multiple names which name is his or her \u201creal name\u201d. If I write articles as \u201cVitalik Buterin\u201d, but make internet posts as \u201cdjargon135\u2033, it is equally legitimate to say \u201cdjargon135 is actually Vitalik Buterin\u201d as it is to say \u201cVitalik Buterin is actually djargon135\u2033; in either case, what matters is that one set of messages claimed to be written by djargon135, and another set of messages claimed to be written by Vitalik Buterin, in fact have a common author. Under this framework, a \u201creal name\u201d is distinguished from a \u201cpseudonym\u201d in one way and one way only: each entity can only have one real name. That is to say, while pseudonyms can be used to prove that two messages were created by the same entity, real names can also be used to prove that two messages were created by two different entities.\nBut this still does not answer the question: why have real names at all? In fact, nearly all applications of a real name can be reduced to one fundamental concept: the giveaway. We all understand what a giveaway is: perhaps a corporation wishes to hand out a free sample of a product to attract potential customers, perhaps a homeless shelter with limited resources wants to feed everyone enough to survive, and thus not let anyone take triple portions for themselves, or perhaps a government agency administering a welfare program wants to prevent people from claiming welfare twice. The idea is simple: X units of some product, service or commodity per person, and if you want more you will have to get your second portion through other channels. One of the use cases of a \u201creal name\u201d used earlier, that of a company owner publishing his details to reassure customers that he is vulnerable to prosecution by law enforcement, does not look like an example of a giveaway, but in fact that company owner is a recipient of a particularly special kind of giveaway in society: that of reputation. In a public key reputation environment, an identity can be created at no cost, so everyone starts out with zero reputation, making business difficult at first. In a real-name system, however, everyone immediately starts out with one pre-made identity, and no way to acquire more, making that identity \u201cexpensive\u201d and thus giving them a fixed quantity of reputation to start out with. Instead of one free sample per person, it\u2019s one free reputation per person, but the principle is the same.\nHow To Implement It\nActually implemening a system, of course, is a challenge. It is very difficult to do with any purely over-the-internet mechanism because anyone can trivially create multiple identites and make them all act like different people. It is certainly possible to weed out some fraud by applying statistical analysis on the messages that everyone signs (eg. if two different identities both consistently spell \u201cactualy\u201d instead of \u201cactually\u201d, that is some strong evidence that they might be linked); however, this can easily be circumvented by combining a spellchecker with a program that deliberately inserts spelling errors and rearranges some grammatical constructions. These tactics can perhaps be themselves corrected for, but ultimately relying solely or even largely on such mechanisms is a recipe for statistical warfare, not any kind of stable identity system.\nSo what\u2019s left? Offline mechanisms. DNA-based identity is the most obvious, although face, iris and fingerprint scans can also add themselves to the list. Currently, government-based identity systems do not use this information too much because government identity documents follow a centralized parent-child model: you want a social insurance number, you need to provide your passport, you lost your passport, you provide a birth certificate and possibly change-of-name certificates if applicable. Ultimately, everything usually depends on a combination of the birth certificate and face recognition on the part of he government agents administering the system. A decentralized system to accomplish this can use both mechanisms, although many will argue that having the ability in theory to register without providing any government documents is a strong positive \u2013 it should be possible to get an identity through the system without necessarily tying in one\u2019s government-backed \u201creal name\u201d (in the usual sense of the term, not my own distinction given above). If this is not possible, then some kind of mixnet-like setup could be used to anonymize identities once they have been created while still maintaining the one-per-person limit. However, attempts at fraud would likely be much more frequent; governments are not, at least at first, going to use any legal mechanisms to enforce anti-fraud rules with these identities as they do with their own documents.\nFrom the above information, it becomes easy to imagine how one might create a centralized organization that accomplishes this objective. The organization would have an office, people would go in, have their biometrics (face, fingerprint, iris, maybe DNA) checked, and would then receive their fresh new cryptographic passport. Why not stop there? In this case, the answer is that the natural monopoly argument applies. Even if the system may have multiple identity providers, they would all need to cross-check information with each other to prevent multiple signups, and the resulting system would necessarily be the only one of its kind.\nIf this system is managed by a corporation, that corporation would have the incentive to start charging high fees once its product becomes ubiquitous and necessary. If it is managed by a government, then the government would have the incentive to tie these identities to its own real names, and remove any privacy features (or at least install a backdoor for itself). Furthermore, it might want the ability to revoke identities as a punishment, and if large parts of the internet (and society at large) start relying on these mechanisms it would become much harder to survive as a fugitive or dissident. Furthermore, there comes another question: which government speficially would administer the system? Even supposedly worldwide bodies like the United Nations are not universally trusted, often precisely because they are such perfect targets for corruption among anyone trying to secure any kind of worldwide control. Thus, to both avoid a corporation subverting the system for profit and a government subverting the system for its own political ends, placing the power into the hands of a decentralized network, if possible, is arguably the best option.\nBut how is it possible? Identity Corp can certainly avoid the truly difficult challenge of actively interacting with the world because all it does is provide information. However, receiving data about the world, including its users\u2019 biometric information, would be nevertheless very challenging. There are no public APIs for such information; the only option would be for some human agent, or group of agents, to collect it. The channel of communication between the humans and the network will be simply digital bits, so it is very easy to see how these agents themselves could defraud the system: they could create many different identities for fake individuals with fake data.\nThe only solution seems to be, once again, decentralization and redundancy: have many different agents collecting the same information, and require individuals looking to get an identity to confirm it with several different agents, ideally randomly (or otherwise) selected by the system itself. These agents would all send out messages to the network containing both biometric data and the identity that data is mapped to, perhaps encrypted using some cryptographic mechanisms that allows two datasets to be checked to see if they are nearly identical but shows nothing else. If two different agents assign two biometric identities to the same data, the second identity can be rejected. If someone tries to register an identity with fake biometric data, they will need to convince a number of specific organizations to somehow accept it. Finally, the system should also include a mechanism for detecting and correcting fraud after the fact, perhaps using some sort of special-purpose decentralized \u201ccourt\u201d.\nThe second challenge is figuring out exactly who these \u201cagents\u201d are going to be. The system should be able to avoid Sybil attacks (the technical term for an attacker pretending to be a million entities so as to take control of a network that relies on consensus), and weed out bad agents without that mechanism itself being subject to bad agents or Sybil attacks. Proof-of-work and proof-of-stake is not enough; since we do not want each individual to travel around the world giving their biometric information to 51% of the network, in practice it may only take as little as 10% or even 5% to pull off fraud on a large scale. Thus, it is quite probable that making a pure decentralized corporation to accomplish this task will be impossible; rather, the best we can hope for is a hybrid system that uses heavy support from humans to keep the network in balance, but at the same time uses the network\u2019s cryptographic properties to force the system to stick to its original mission. This would be somewhere between a legal contract or constitution and a true decentralized network, but the distinction there is a very fluid one; as Lawrence Lessig is keen to point out, \u201ccode is law\u201c.\nSocialCoin and the One World \u201cGovernment\u201d\nThe existence of a decentralized \u201creal name\u201d system allows for a large number of possibilities that have so far been unexplored in the cryptocurrency world. One attractive possibility is SocialCoin, the cryptocurrency that pays everyone in the world a \u201cworld citizen\u2019s dividend\u201d of 1000 units per month; another, similar alternative is to plug the system into a Devcoin-like system, allowing people to come together and vote on projects that the money should be spent on, thereby creating what is essentially a (voluntary) \u201cworld government\u201d that funds itself from the revenue from generating new currency units. How much money could such a government get while still maintaining a low inflation rate? Here, there are two factors to keep in mind: people dying and losing their coins forever, and actual inflation.\nCurrently, when someone dies, their property automatically goes to their children or spouse by default. In a cryptocurrency, however, by default a person\u2019s monetary savings simply become inaccessible since their passwords are lost. This destruction of coins creates a deflationary pressure; given the current death rate of around 8 per 1000 per year, multiplying by a factor of 2 to account for the fact that people tend to be somewhat wealthier than average at the time of their death, and then again dividing by 3 to take into account the fact that many people will have a system set up to ensure their wealth will go somewhere when they die (currently, about half the population has wills, and the divider can be bumped to 3 since people with more money are more likely to have them), we can get an estimate of 0.5% coin loss per year.\nThis, combined with a low target inflation rate of 1.5%, means that we can \u201cprint\u201d 2% of the current money supply every year. Since cryptocurrencies will massively reduce the amount of fractional reserve banking in the world (as the cryptocurrency base unit is online, so individuals no longer \u201cneed\u201d to store their money in banks in order to maintain savings accounts and make long-distance transactions), we can expect much of the world\u2019s M2 and M3 money supply (ways of calculating money supply that include bank deposits) to become part of the base money supply of a cryptocurrency. The M2 money supply of the world is estimated at around $40 trillion, giving our world government a budget of $800 billion per year to play with \u2013 or, in the case of SocialCoin, a universal dividend of $114 per person per year.\nIn theory, a world government can do a lot with $800 billion per year; in practice, it remains to be seen how free from corruption such an institution would be, although in this case the fact that it will be controlled by direct democracy, and have no power to tax, can potentially serve as powerful restraints on abuse. It would essentially be a government in the sense of being an entity tasked with maintaining social infrastructure, but would lack the power to coerce and compel that might make it particularly dangerous. Or, we can simply stick with SocialCoin, and leave it up to each individual to improve their lives the best that they can with $114 per year \u2013 almost nothing to most people reading this article, but a very substantial amount in many underdeveloped countries. If the system can be made to rely on no centralized institutions and no tax revenue, it can secure a level of political neutrality that would allow it to be trusted by the entire world. Will it happen? Well, either wait and see to find out, or start implementing it yourself.", "year": 2013, "month": 9, "day": 25}

The BIT is the first U.S.-based private investment vehicle to invest in bitcoin alone and received a $2 million seed investment from SecondMarket. Moving forward, shares of the BIT will be exclusively offered through SecondMarket. SecondMarket and BIT pushed out the following press release this evening:\nBitcoin Investment Trust Launches on SecondMarket\nFirst U.S.-based private investment vehicle to invest exclusively in bitcoin begins raising capital\nNEW YORK, Sept. 26, 2013 \u2013 The Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT), a private investment vehicle, announced today that it has begun raising capital on SecondMarket. The BIT is an open-ended, private trust that is exclusively invested in bitcoin and derives its value solely from the price of bitcoin. It enables institutional and accredited individual investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without the buying, storing and safekeeping challenges of direct bitcoin ownership. The BIT is the first U.S.-based private investment vehicle to invest exclusively in bitcoin.\nThe BIT\u2019s sponsor is Alternative Currency Asset Management (ACAM), a wholly-owned subsidiary of SecondMarket. Shares of the BIT are being exclusively offered through SecondMarket, a registered broker-dealer. SecondMarket has also made a $2 million seed investment in the BIT.\n\u201cWe incubated the BIT to alleviate the problems of direct bitcoin ownership, including having to wire money to newly-established and potentially unregulated entities around the world,\u201d said SecondMarket Founder and CEO Barry Silbert. \u201cSecondMarket has a track record of making alternative investments accessible to a broader group of qualified investors, and our infrastructure enables streamlined capital raising, liquidity, and investor communications for funds and companies. Thus, we believe that a bitcoin-related investment vehicle is a great fit for SecondMarket.\u201d\nBitcoin is a digital currency and global transaction network that was created to eliminate the challenges of using analog currency and payment mechanisms in a digital world. Since its inception in 2009, the market capitalization of bitcoin has risen to $1.5 billion, 24 million bitcoin transactions have been conducted, and more than 10,000 vendors now accept bitcoin. Proponents believe that bitcoin has potential as a store of value, global currency and/or global transaction network, and could disrupt the incumbents in e-commerce, remittance and other related industries. Only a finite number of bitcoins can ever be created; accordingly, bitcoin may not suffer the inflationary impact of fiat currencies.\n\u201cWe believe that bitcoin may have significant upside given the size and scope of the industries that potentially are impacted by bitcoin,\u201d Silbert noted. \u201cHowever, bitcoin also faces regulatory uncertainty and widespread adoption issues that make investing in bitcoin a highly risky endeavor.\u201d\nAs sponsor, ACAM has retained prominent service providers including Sidley Austin LLP (legal counsel), Ernst & Young (auditor), Continental Stock Transfer & Trust (transfer agent) and SecondMarket (marketplace, custodian and authorized participant). Investors who purchase shares in the BIT will have the opportunity to gain liquidity through periodic auctions on SecondMarket beginning in 2014. The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the BIT will be calculated daily and made publicly available.\nFor more information, visit bitcointrust.co.\n###\nAbout ACAM\nAlternative Currency Asset Management (ACAM), a wholly-owned subsidiary of SecondMarket, is an asset manager focused on alternative currencies, including bitcoin.

{"title": "Ripple is Officially Open Source", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/ripple-is-officially-open-source-1380246874/", "birthday": "Sep 26, 2013  9:54 PM EST", "date": "2013-09-27 02:54:00", "content": "Ripple Labs (formerly OpenCoin) CTO Stefan Thomas has announced that, as of today, the source code for the peer-to-peer node behind the Ripple payment network is officially open source. Parts of Ripple, particularly a Javascript-based web client, have been open source for months, but the release of the peer-to-peer \u201cfull node\u201d, rippled (comparable to Bitcoin\u2019s bitcoind) means that the community now, at least in theory, has the entire suite of tools needed to maintain the Ripple network on its own.\nRipple is a peer-to-peer digital payment network, similar to Bitcoin in many ways, but with a number of distinguishing features. First of all, and most importantly, Ripple allows users to use Bitcoin-like cryptographically signed transactions to store and transfer almost anything \u2013 US dollars, euros, Swiss francs, gold and silver and even potentially company shares can all be handled on the network. The way that Ripple manages this is by storing all assets as debts between parties that trust each other. If someone wants to send some quantity of an asset to someone that they do not trust, then the Ripple network finds a path between the two such that every link is between two people that do trust each other. In practice, the social network is still not nearly dense enough to make this fully decentralized vision work, so Ripple has given rise to a secondary industry of \u201cgateways\u201d that everyone can trust because they are publicly visible entities. Second, Ripple includes a built-in \u201cdecentralized exchange\u201d functionality, allowing people to exchange on Ripple asset for another without trusting either the person they\u2019re trading with or any third parties. Finally, Ripple uses a mechanism known as \u201cconsensus\u201d instead of Bitcoin\u2019s mining, theoretically allowing the network to maintain stability without being vulnerable to 51% attacks or consuming any electricity beyond the minimum required to verify transactions and maintain network connections.\nHowever, Ripple has also had its fair share of criticism. The fact that all assets inside of Ripple (except Ripple\u2019s own currency, the XRP) exist only as debts is on the one hand an advantage, as it allows such assets to be represented in a cryptographic way in the first place, but it is also a disadvantage, as Ripple loses Bitcoin\u2019s trust-free nature. Some critics argue that Ripple only copies those aspects of the current fiat currency and fractional reserve-based financial system that cryptocurrency is meant to solve.\nA much greater point of criticism, however, is the XRP itself. The currency exists inside the Ripple network for two main purposes. First, it is the only currency in the Ripple network that does not require trust to send. Without XRP, if there was no \u201ctrust path\u201d between A and B, there would be no way for A to send B any money. With XRP, the path can consist of exchanges between the desired currency and XRP at the ends and a trust-free XRP transfer in the middle. Second, like Bitcoin, Ripple uses transaction fees to limit malicious users\u2019 ability to pollute the blockchain, and XRP is a neutral currency that these fees can be paid in. However, the XRP has one major problem: Ripple Labs, the parent company behind Ripple, owns all 100 billion XRP units that will ever exist, and it only plans to distribute a part of them to the community \u2013 the rest will go to early investors and the company\u2019s founders. When questioned about this at the Bitcoin conference in San Jose, CEO Chris Larsen simply replied that the company chose this distribution model to better attract top-quality Silicon Valley talent and investment \u2013 hardly a satisfying argument to those who believe that the main problems with the current financial system are inequality and greed.\nThe last major criticism, of course, is the argument that Ripple is centralized. Ripple has claimed to be open source from the moment it was publicly released, but in practice for the past year only the web client has been open. Thus, the Ripple network was entirely controlled by Ripple Labs, allowing the company to modify parts of the Ripple protocol at will \u2013 at one point, for example, Ripple reduced the minimum balance for a Ripple account from 200 XRP to 50 XRP, and was able to do this without consulting anyone at all. Ripple Labs developers continued to promise that they would open-source the code eventually, but nothing happened. As time wore on, many Ripple users began to lose faith in Ripple Labs\u2019s intentions, and the value of the XRP tanked; by the beginning of September, the XRP was down 75% from its peak.\nThis Changes\u2026 Many Things\nRipple Labs\u2019s announcement does nothing about the first problem with XRP; most of the 100 billion units remain squarely under Ripple Labs\u2019s control. However, the second problem with Ripple, the fact that the network is centralized, is now partially solved. The source code is now open source, meaning that everyone is free to start their own node or gateway, and even if Ripple Labs disappears the network can now continue functioning. Later on, this can lead to the network becoming decentralized even with Ripple Labs\u2019s continued support. For now, however, Stefan Thomas writes: \u201cwe will continue to recommend our own validators for the time being\u201d. The \u201cvalidators\u201d that Stefan Thomas was referring to are the nodes used to secure Ripple\u2019s consensus system; in theory, Ripple can be decentralized if everyone trusts a diverse group of nodes as validators. Some validation nodes might be run by universities, others by banks and corporations, others by nonprofits and perhaps some even by governments. The equivalent of a Bitcoin-style 51% attack would require the attacker to take over the vast majority of trusted nods at the same time. Right now, however, all Ripple clients are set to trust Ripple\u2019s validation nodes by default, making the network still centralized for the moment.\nHowever, those who are unhappy about Ripple\u2019s weaknesses now have another potential solution up their sleeve: they can also fork the source code. \u201cDoes that worry me [regarding] job security?,\u201d Stefan Thomas writes, \u201cOf course. But that\u2019s the whole point of open-sourcing: It\u2019s one thing we can do to help keep us honest. I believe as long as we continue to live up to our promises, work hard and provide value to users, they will continue to use our network. And in doing so they\u2019re supporting our effort to build out the software and extend the network through any and all means available until all XRP are sold or given away.\u201d Bitcoin has already given rise to about 70 alternative cryptocurrencies, and although some do significantly change certain features (particularly the mining algorithm), by and large these alternatives are all very similar; by design, they are all forks of the bitcoind source code and change at most a few files. Will we see another 70 alternative Ripple-like currencies appear? Perhaps. There are few obvious possibilities: different consensus algorithms, or even a version of Ripple with more traditional proof-of-work or proof-of-stake mining, a version of Ripple that somehow replaces the current version\u2019s pre-mined XRP, and a version of Ripple that allows users to store public information on their accounts (potentially allowing for a Ripple-based version of Namecoin, or even a web-of-trust system) are all very viable options.\nWhat will be the most interesting about the open-sourced code may well be the consensus algorithm. If it works, consensus is arguably a major improvement over any of the \u201cmining\u201d-like algorithms that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can offer; it both completely removes Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cwasted electricity\u201d problem and makes it much more difficult to successfully execute an attack against the network. However, the main objection is, will it actually work? Up until now, the process has been well-documented on the Ripple wiki in text, diagrams and a video. However, the description has been high-level, and the documentation has not been in a formal form suitable for mathematical or cryptographic analysis. Now, we have access to the source code, which is literally as formal a description of the consensus process that one can get. For the first time, actual cryptographers outside of Ripple Labs will be able to create mathematical models out of the code, run simulations or prove theorems on it and see if it actually lives up to the hype.\nFor non-cryptographers, the code appears well-commented, making it a friendly form of documentation into Ripple\u2019s inner workings all by itself. It will probably take some time before the outside cryptocurrency community gains enough of an understanding into the software\u2019s inner workings to be able to understand it or work on alternatives; however, anyone with questions to ask will have the opportunity to have them answered at the Ripple developer conference from October 5 to 10. Ripple is very much a long-term-focused project; the company has been in a semi-released state for roughly seven months, and the company will have many more months to build up a development community that extends beyond just the company. Will the cryptocurrency community hop on? Only time will tell.", "year": 2013, "month": 9, "day": 27}
{"title": "Bitcoiners From Around the World Meet in Amsterdam", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoiners-from-around-the-world-meet-in-amsterdam-1380482873/", "birthday": "Sep 29, 2013  3:27 PM EST", "date": "2013-09-29 20:27:00", "content": "Bitcoiners From Around the World Meet in Amsterdam\nOver the past three days, we saw in Amsterdam the fourth major Bitcoin conference this year, following the Bitcoin conference in San Jose in May and the two in London and New York in July. The event brought together roughly two hundred people from around the world, and packed in three days of presentations and panel discussions on Bitcoin businesses, software development, government regulation and even economics. Many businesses took the opportunity to announce their presence for the first time through booths or presentations, and many existing businesses announced new features or products; perhaps the most major announcement was that Ripple is now open-source.\nUnlike the conference in London, and like the conference in San Jose, the main focus of the event was Bitcoin businesses. Businesses had the opportunity to set up booths in the conference room iself, making themselves highly visible throughout the presentations, and half of the presentations themselves were from individual Bitcoin businesses presenting themselves. Among the \u201cold guard\u201d, business attendees included BitPay, the Bitcoin merchant processor that now has ten thousand merchants signed up accepting Bitcoin, BitPay\u2019s European competitor BIPS, US Bitcoin exchange and merchant processor Coinbase, and the alternative payment networks Ripple and OpenTransactions. The newer Bitcoin businesses, showing themselves to the community for the first time, include the self-explanatory Anonymous Ads, the Bitcoin clothing and merchandise seller B-side, Swedish Bitcoin exchange Btcx.se and the online marketplace Egora. Somewhere in the middle are the Trezor Bitcoin hardware wallet and BitsOfProof, a company developing an alternative full implementation of Bitcoin geared for enterprise use.\nHowever, although the format of having presentations and booths in the same room had its advantages, it was also limiting. Businesses had little opportunity to actually demonstrate their products to anyone up close, and even talking to entrepreneurs was a challenge. In San Jose, on the other hand, businesses had a separate exhibition room to set up in, making it possible to interact with entrepreneurs and representatives at length without disturbing the presenters who were in other rooms. Another issue was space; in San Jose, every business had susbtantial room to set themselves up, whereas here every business only had one table against the wall of the conference room.\nIn terms of the theme of the event, the relative absence of the mainstream finance community, so heavily dominant at the conference in London, and the alternative emphasis on businesses providing low-level infrastructure was certainly a welcome change. However, the more radical conception of this event as \u201can open-source conference\u201d was difficult to see; all in all, the event was simply just another conference. One can argue that in this regard the conference\u2019s organizers did exactly the right thing; they stuck to the same pattern that has been proven to work reasonably well in previous conferences, but made subtle steps in their choice of speakers to push the general theme of the conference closer to what they wanted to see.\nTwo weeks ago, Moe Levin wrote: \u201cwe\u2019re trying to be different. We\u2019ve done market research on attendees and saw that people wanted to see more devs, more entrepreneurs, and more of the people that are not \u2018getting rich quick\u2019. they want to see people with good ideas, working on them, and succeeding in making the community a better place.\u201d Looking back now, in this regard the conference certainly succeeded. However, in some places the conference certainly could have done more to be different. The organizers expressed the desire to set up a \u201cconvention\u201d rather than a \u201cconference\u201d; this was certainly a noble sentiment, as Bitcoin convention attendees often say that the main benefit of the events is networking,in reality, however, there were no organized events other than the presentations, so the word \u201cconference\u201d was really the only way to accurately describe the event. This is in many ways related to the space issue; if the businesses had the opportunity to set up larger booths and have a heavier focus on directly interacting with people outside of pre-scheduled presentations, the \u201cconvention\u201d aspect of the conference would have been much better executed.\nThe Regulatory Panel\nOne particularly interesting part of the conference was the regulatory panel, where a representative from the Dutch central bank (Wieske Ebben) and one from the Amsterdam police (Niels Ploeger) showed up. Aside from the regulatory conference last month in New York, which included such figures as the former chairman of FINCEN, there have so far been no governmental or regulatory figures willing to speak directly and in person to a Bitcoin audience. In this conference, we had not one, but two, government representatives speaking. From Wieske Ebben, the representative from the Dutch central bank, the focus was trust. Among Ebben\u2019s key words include this:\nWe have goals as a central bank. We have to ensure financial stability, stable and reliable financial systems and those are our objectives. If we see if Bitcoin can contribute to that or has the opposite effect, then we see what we can do about it.\nReplying to the question of what she thought about the idea of cryptocurrencies overtaking fiat currencies:\n[Cryptocurrencies overtaking fiat currencies] could be a case I don\u2019t see happening quite soon. But we look at it from different angles of course. As a central bank in the Netherlands, we\u2019re both supervisor and central bank. You cannot regulate Bitcoin, but on the other levels you could do something about it. For us, we\u2019re definitely looking into it, we don\u2019t want to make a bold statement yet.\nReplying to the question of how she feels about the fact that Bitcoin appears to be specifically designed to take away governments\u2019 power to monitor financial transactions and confiscate money at will:\nI canot speak for every regulator, but it is something difficult, this Bitcoin system. Of course we want to see everything and confiscate money [audience laughs] \u2026 we have to see what we can do and what we can\u2019t do. With all the new payment methods and technology there is always a way to fit it into the regulatory system \u2013 there was always a connection. Now, it\u2019s something completely different.\nOn local currencies:\nLocal currencies have real value in those local communities, for instance, so it\u2019s not something that should be gone, it has very real value. So maybe there will be more of these currencies that do have value in and of themselves. For there to be a payment system that people trust, for us that\u2019s the important thing. But if one currency would for any reason harm that trust, that\u2019s something we will need to do something about. For us trust is the most important thing.\nHer thoughts on Bitcoin, and her advice to Bitcoin businesses:\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s my job to say that Bitcoin will solve all the monetary issues so let\u2019s switch to it. I don\u2019t think that will happen \u2026 I understand that Bitcoin has value in online payments. As regulators we\u2019re always behind in online payments. What I can only say is, try and do and give services and build your trust, and as long as you\u2019re open or transparent and can create trust very well.\nAnd here are some words from the Amsterdam Police representative, Niels Ploeger:\n[I am doing] research on new payment methods, so that\u2019s why I came across Bitcoin \u2026 Bitcoin is being used for extortion, for example. Because it\u2019s irreversible it\u2019s beneficial for criminals to use Bitcoin to use money around. If you are extorted and pay with BTC it\u2019s harder to trace what happens. I personally encourage the Bitcoin community to come up with some kind of method to make it less attractive for criminals.\nIs Bitcoin actually being used for criminal purposes on a large scale?\nThere is not much [crime] happening with Bitcoin other than Tor marketplaces. There are some cases where money from bank accounts is transferred to Bitcoin exchanges.\nWieske Ebben\u2019s acknowledgement that the Dutch central bank was not planning on regulating Bitcoin itself at the protocol level was taken as a strongly encouraging sign by the Bitcoin community. Many people fear that the US government, or other governments, will either try to make Bitcoin itself illegal or try to force Bitcoin developers to implement privacy-reducing features into the system. On the more extreme end, some are concerned that the government will require transaction reversibility or mandatory identity verification. However, more subtle possibilities do exist; one example is a fee for registering a new Bitcoin address, designed to discourage users from using one address per transaction to increase their privacy. If Ebben\u2019s words are to be taken at face value, at least the Dutch government will try none of these things, and any regulatory efforts that it makes will be focused on regulating Bitcoin businesses instead.\nWieske Ebben\u2019s claim that the central bank\u2019s regulatory efforts are aimed at maintaining public trust has received less attention, but it is arguably equally significant; specifically, it means that the importance of Bitcoin\u2019s anonymity is overstated, and the greater problem in regulators\u2019 eyes is the risk that Bitcoin businesses will either pull a MyBitcoin or Pirate-style disppearance or lose their customers\u2019 deposits to hackers. In this regard, the Bitcoin community is already taking excellent strides toward regulating itself; nearly all Bitcoin exchanges and financial platforms now store over 80% of their Bitcoin funds in cold storage, a policy that has already saved depositors\u2019 funds when Bitcoin Central was hacked in April. Gambling sites use provably fair gambling to prove to their customers that their random number generators are fair and they cannot cheat without making it immediately publicly obvious. In theory, it is possible to make exchanges\u2019 cold wallets publicly verifiable as well, putting to rest concerns that individual Bitcoin exchanges are actually stealing users\u2019 deposits and maintaining a fractional reserve for their own gain. These aspects of Bitcoin, far from inspiring governments and banks to strike against it, should make regulators quite excited about the possibilities that Bitcoin can bring.\nThe next two conferences in the Bitcoin scene will be the Crypto-Currency Conference in Atlanta on October 5, followed by the Ripple developer conference on October 6-10 in Las Vegas. The Crypto-Currency Conference will focus heavily on the implications of Bitcoin for economics and monetary policy, whereas the Ripple developer conference will focus on technical aspects and merchant integration. Further on, we can expect to see a conference in Argentina, as well as an unSYSTEM event in the spring of 2014 (which was originally planned for early November this year).

The attacker managed to get in by breaking into the exchange\u2019s virtual private server, allowing them to access its online \u201chot wallet\u201d and withdraw all of the funds. Fortunately, the bulk of the exchange\u2019s BTC funds were stored in offline \u201ccold storage\u201d so Bitcoin Central was able to absorb the loss and fully reimburse its customers, but the platform\u2019s developers nevertheless saw it fit to take down the site to prevent any further losses while they figured out exactly what went wrong. What happened over the next six months was a complete redesign; the website was rebuilt from the ground up, the trading engine was split up into multiple components, and tight security and redundancy mechanisms were added on all levels. The site\u2019s operators had originally intended to bring the site back online in the middle of the summer; in reality, however, June and July came and went, and not a word came from Bitcoin Central; indeed, some even began to suspect that the site was gone for good. But now, after nearly five and a half months of downtime, Bitcoin Central is back online.\nThe first sign that Bitcoin Central has changed appears as soon as the site is loaded; the site now features a radically redesigned web interface that is both simpler and much more visually appealing than the old version, and includes a detailed statistics page, latest trade data and support for English and French. The charts are not yet too interesting, as volume on the site is still low, but once people start depositing to the exchange and trading in full force that is likely to change. But what is more interesting is the extent to which the exchange has changed on the backend. CTO David Fran\u00e7ois writes:\nThe complete stack has been redesigned from the ground up to vastly improve performance, security, flexibility and ease of maintenance:* The architecture has been split into independent software components that talk to each other, which ensures a much better fault-tolerance, horizontal scalability, independent auditing and monitoring.* Our security infrastructure and procedures are now designed in such a way that the compromise of one or several components has no impact on the integrity of our data and accounting; this is achieved through a mix of software evolutions and tight operational procedures.\n\u201cFundamentally\u201d, Pierre Noizat summarizes, \u201cthere are no private keys on the servers anymore\u201d. From a security perspective, taking the private keys away from the public-facing servers is likely the single most important improvement that was made; by keeping the part of the system that handles private keys and signs transactions as simple and isolated as possible, the architecture minimizes the risk that attackers will find some flaw that allows them to extract the private keys and steal the exchange\u2019s online funds. When the site was taken down in April, it sufficed to simply get into the public-facing server to get this information. Now, one must get into the public-facing server, retrieve the IP address of the key-handling server, and then hack into that server as well. Still theoretically possible, but with far more parts that need to fail at the same time for any kind of attack to succeed.\nThe database of which users hold much many bitcoins in their accounts is another important issue; when Bitcoinica was hacked for the second time in May 2012, the main difficulty in reimbursing customers, a difficulty which still remains largely unresolved, is that the attacker managed to not only steal about a tenth of the already financially struggling site\u2019s funds, but also deleted both the live copy of the account database and the backup. In the new Bitcoin Central, \u201cthe accounting database is secured in multiple ways.\u201d Bitcoin Central is hesitant to share further details about exactly how everything is secured; \u201cas much as we do not believe in \u2018security by obscurity\u2019 for algorithms,\u201d Noizat writes, \u201cwe do believe that knowledge of the server architecture can help a would be intruder.\u201d\nAlmost A Bank Account\nBitcoin Central first became famous in December 2012 when the exchange announced an agreement with the payment services provider Aqoba to convert the fiat currency portion of its users\u2019 exchange accounts into what would essentially be bank accounts. Each account would have its own international bank account number (IBAN), allowing anyone to wire money to it just like any other bank account, and Bitcoin Central had plans to come out with a debit card that could spend from the account. The only difference is, as Noizat describes it, that \u201cthat the funds are not \u2018deposits'; they cannot be used by the Payment Institution to issue credit.\u201d The Aqoba move was hailed by many as a massive step forward in banking and regulatory integration, especially since Bitcoin Central employees had had extensive discussions with regulators while they were working out the details of their agreement. Unfortunately, it never came to pass. Months of delays came and went, and at the end of April the whole effort was abruptly cut short when Bitcoin Central shut down. Two and a half months later, bitcoin.de in Germany made a very similar deal with Fidor Bank, the implementation of which is still in its later stages today.\nBut Bitcoin Central has not given up, and is only coming back stronger. Noizat writes: \u201cWe have clinched a deal with a new Payment Institution partner, namely Lemon Way. Our systems are now fully integrated to speed up the funding and withdrawals operations to the point where I believe we will offer the shortest possible turn around time (one or two days at most) to buyers and sellers of bitcoins. Each customer of bitcoin-central now has a full-fledged, regulated payment account with our licensed partner, as soon as the customer account is verified.\u201d This is significant; there have been talks for many months from Bitcoin Central, Fidor and others about having a direct partnership with some kind of banking partner, but this is the first time that anyone has actually carried the integration through to completion. As unlikely as it seemed when Bitcoin Central shut down and bitcoin.de charged ahead with its announcement with Fidor, it appears now like Bitcoin Central is the first one to integrate directly with the banking system after all.\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin Central\u2019s payment accounts are much more limited in scope than the original vision that the company had with Aqoba. The accounts with Lemon Way have no IBAN, and although Bitcoin Central does plan to make it possible to fund the accounts with bank card transactions, even that functionality is not expected to come out until early 2014. Furthermore, because payment services providers, unlike banks, are not authorized to use deposited funds to issue credit, anyone wishing to get an interest rate on their deposits should best wait for the finished integration between Fidor and bitcoin.de.\nSo that is the benefit of having a regulated payment account? In essence, safety. With the way exchanges currently work, depositors are essentially creditors to the exchange; the exchange has, in the short term, full control over depositors\u2019 funds, and if the exchange starts taking these funds for its own use depositors need to go through the legal system to get any recourse. Sometimes, it is not even the exchange\u2019s fault, as either regulatory difficulties or banks\u2019 unwillingness to work with Bitcoin exchanges leads to long delays for customers trying to recover their deposits. Both of these concerns are very real. In Germany, regulators began an investigation into Bitcoin24 earlier this year, concerned that the exchange was stealing users\u2019 deposited funds; the current situation is still unclear, although many people report having received their funds back. As for externally caused problems, earlier this year when Bitfloor shut down due to banking problems, it took months for its founder Roman Shtylman to find a bank that would allow him to redistribute deposited funds to his customers. With regulated payment accounts, at least these problems can be avoided; there will be a clean separation between exchange funds and customer funds, and even if the exchange goes down the payment services provider will be able to handle withdrawals.\nBitcoin in France and Abroad\nBitcoin\u2019s popularity in France, where Bitcoin Central is based, continues to lag behind its popularity in countries like Germany, the Netherlands and the UK. Pierre Noizat writes: \u201cFrance and more generally, southern European countries seem to lag behind Northern European countries and behind countries where English is a dominant language. I believe the main reason is that most of the bitcoin literature is in English. That is a side effect of the free software, open source nature of bitcoin; things go fast and not enough resources are devoted to producing localized educational material. Translations of software are a good thing and can be crowdsourced but development and technical discussions still take place in English.\u201d This argument is certainly a valid one; looking at various countries in the world by the percentage of English speakers and the Google Trends search volume for Bitcoin does indeed reveal a strong correlation:\nPercentage of English speakersBitcoin search volume\nWith regard to those countries where the dominant language does not even use the same alphabet, the correlation is somewhat artificial; Russian Bitcoin users, for example, might be searching for \u201c\u0411\u0438\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0439\u043d\u201d and not \u201cBitcoin\u201d. Furthermore, much of the correlation is caused by the fact that Bitcoin and English are both more popular in countries with advanced economies. However, even looking only at countries of similar wealth where the Latin alphabet dominates, there are substantial similarities between the two graphs; the strength of the Netherlands, the Scandinavian countries, Israel (where the alphabet effect is mitigated since very many people speak English), Canada, the US and Australia, and the weakness of France, is apparent in both charts.\nBitcoin Central\u2019s Pierre Noizat has written a number of educational materials explaining Bitcoin in French, including the book \u201cBitcoin: Monnaie Libre\u201d, available in hardcover on Lulu and Amazon. In time, hopefully more Bitcoin materials in French and other languages will become available.\nFor now, though, Bitcoin Central is offering its services beyond just France. \u201cThanks to our partnership with a licensed Payment Institution,\u201d Noizat writes, \u201cwe are legally authorized to serve all residents of the 30 states in the European Economic Area. Because of the SEPA wire transfer mechanism it does not make any difference whether we serve a customer in Denmark or in France: the account funding and withdrawal operations take one or two days at most.\u201d Thus, Bitcoin Central should best be thought of as a European exchange, next to Bitstamp and bitcoin.de, and not a platform specific to France; anyone in the European Union (except Croatia), Switzerland and even Iceland can benefit. For other parts of the world, Bitcoin Central is offering its trading engine under a licensing agreement; Noizat reports that they have already initiated discussions with a USD exchange, \u201cbut there are opportunities with many other currencies.\u201d", "year": 2013, "month": 10, "day": 2}

Cathy serves as a D.C.-based writer and political commentator, working at Reason Magazine. She is Editor in Chief of Sex and the State, is a Young Voices Associate and writes regularly for Doublethink magazine and Thoughts on Liberty. Her writing has appeared in the Washington Examiner, the Daily Caller, the AFF Free the Future blog, the Individualist Feminist, and Penelope Trunk\u2019s Brazen Careerist. One of her passions is investigating the role of Bitcoin social evolution. Cathy\u2019s talk follows.\nCathy Reisenwitz: \u201cWhy a Free Society Needs a Free Money\u201d\nSaturday, October 6- Atlanta, GA\nIt may seem weird to begin a talk at a Bitcoin conference with a review of the scientific method. But I feel like if there were any audience outside the sciences who would at least tolerate that, I think it would be this one.\nAnd the reason I think that is that everyone here, and everyone who plays with Bitcoin is a scientist, and we\u2019re all participating in a great experiment.\nWe all know what an experiment is. We form a hypothesis and test it. But, simple as it is, the experiment is the best way to attempt to verify what we think we know about the world.\nAnd the world includes currencies.\nIt may seem weird to say it, but I believe it would be impossible to overstate the importance of the invention of money to prosperity. By making trade easier, currency fosters the innovation necessary to create wealth.\nSo it\u2019s a pretty important thing to understand. And to learn about currencies, we have to formulate theories and test them.\nThere are two ways to run experiments with currencies.\nFirst, governments can, and do, experiment with monetary policy. When it comes down to it, the leaders of the Weinmar Republic were just running an experiment.\nWe\u2019ve seen the consequences of this kind of experimentation. At the worst end you have Germany, Chile and Zimbabwe. Not far from that you have the troubles with the Euro, from riots in Greece to the money grab in Cyprus which prompted the latest Bitcoin boom. Then you have what we\u2019re seeing in America, which is the long, slow erosion of wealth and savings through a steady stream of monetary inflation.\nNot only does inflation slowly eat away at individual wealth, but it also disincentivizes savings. And without savings, there\u2019s nothing to invest. So then without real savings, investment requires more quantitative easing, which begets more inflation, and the cycle continues.\nOn the other hand, individuals can experiment with new currencies themselves. In this case, fewer experimenters lessens the fallout of a hypothesis not supported by the evidence. In addition, instead of creating victims like government experiments, everyone participating in these experiments is a volunteer.\nThis, in essence, is Bitcoin. And this is why we\u2019re all here.\nLike good scientists, you came to Bitcoin with questions. Each one of you got here by first asking a question or two about currency. Each person wanted to know something slightly different, and for different reasons. Can an online currency offer anonymity but still be trustworthy? Can a free-market currency keep or increase its value? Can I trust an algorithm to limit inflation? Will an online currency lower transaction costs? Will it allow retailers to avoid paying credit card and debit card fees? Will wildly fluctuating value make an online currency unusable? Then many of you read up on the problem you wanted to solve in order to decide whether and how to use Bitcoin to try to answer these questions.\nThen, you used Bitcoin to experiment. You saw what happened. And you wrote about the results. You Tweeted about them. You made MOOC courses about them. You created conferences, all to share with the world all the incredibly valuable information you were learning about currency.\nAnd yet, even though these experiments were completely voluntary. Even though they yielded incredibly useful knowledge. Even though you\u2019ve been incredibly generous in your sharing of that knowledge. Some people have tried to keep you from experimenting.\nOne Bitcoin user created an exchange which completely solved the problem of violence in the drug trade. He created the eBay of narcotics, and in doing so he replaced broken kneecaps with bad user reviews. Instead of armed robbery, he made sure the Bitcoins weren\u2019t released until the goods arrived. Now his invention has been forcefully seized, all his customers have been dumped back on the streets, and in the process they\u2019ve more Bitcoins than ever before.\nBefore that, they\u2019ve seized the assets of your exchanges. They\u2019ve intimidated your non-profits with threatening letters. They\u2019ve threatened to tax you. And they\u2019re looking into ways to regulate you.\nGovernments try to control currencies. With all that power, shouldn\u2019t they seek to learn as much about them as possible? Why would anyone attempt to kneecap thousands of unpaid, volunteer experimenters, who are constantly sharing with the world what we\u2019re learning about how money works? It\u2019s very odd.\nIt\u2019s almost as if they\u2019re more interested in making sure they control the experiment than in learning as much as they can.\nWhich is unfortunate. Because when used right, trustworthy, flexible currencies facilitate investment, innovation and, ultimately, prosperity. And when misused, they bring ruin, stagnation and poverty. Figuring out how to use money is incredibly important. Much too important for us to let petty politics, turf wars and prohibition stop progress.\nEarlier, I called you all scientists. And like all scientists, you need your materials, your variables and your constants in order to experiment. But that\u2019s not enough. You also need the space and freedom to experiment. That\u2019s what\u2019s threatened by taxation, regulation and intimidation.\nMy purpose here is to first emphasize the importance of what you\u2019re doing with Bitcoin. I truly believe you are early pioneers who are ultimately making the world a richer place.\nBut then I also want to motivate you to join me in fighting for the freedom to continue doing it.\nBecause it\u2019s truly up to us, to the people who understand what this knowledge can do for the world, to fight for the freedom to find it. Please, join me in the fight to keep Bitcoin free and legal.\nThank you.", "year": 2013, "month": 10, "day": 10}

Attendees spanned from various states in the US and even nations around the world. Some of the highlights of this conference were a Friday evening reception at BitPay Inc\u2019s Atlanta office, a keynote address by Jeffrey Tucker, Executive Editor of Laissez Faire Books, and time for attendees to network and share projects and ideas.\nI had the privilege of attending the conference and found that perhaps the most impactful time was the networking opportunity for members of the Bitcoin community and those interested in learning more. In between the various speakers, dialogue included projects in the works, and discussion of decentralized solutions to the various centralized problems our society faces today. Bitcoin Magazine had a table and sold copies of current and past issues.\nJeffrey Tucker opened the conference with a discussion on Bitcoin as, \u201cA New Currency for the Digital Age.\u201d Tucker shared of his first encounter with the Bitcoin currency and how he no longer is skeptical but supportive of the potential of a digital, decentralized cryptocurrency. As the conference pulled in a larger Libertarian constituency, the discussion was taken beyond Bitcoin to address the needs of free societies for decentralization. Michael Goldstein, co-founder of the Mises Circle, addressed how Bitcoin is a technology sparking a movement beyond just money. Cathy Reisenwitz, DC-based writer and political commentator, based her discussion on \u201cWhy a free society needs free money.\u201d Daniel Krawisz appealed to Libertarians and made a case for the need for Libertarians to understand Cryptography. To address doubts students of the Austrian School of Economics may have of Bitcoin, Peter Surda emphasized that Bitcoin is sound money and carries just as much or more validity than gold. Tuur Demeester, author of MacroTrends, spoke on Bitcoin and the end of collectivism.\nFrom a business standpoint, Adam B. Levine, Editor in Chief of Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin, addressed, \u201cDoing Business with a Rising-Value Currency,\u201d and moderated a panel with Tony Gallippi and Stephen Pair of BitPay and also Charlie Schrem of BitInstant. Stephen Pair highlighted how Bitcoin is not the first crypto-currency but perhaps now the strongest crypto-currency. Dan Larimer, creator of BitShares and Keyhotee, shared of his company\u2019s model for decentralized solutions to centralized problems. BitShares serves as a peer to peer exchange and trading platform. Keyhotee serves as a privacy platform and a secure window for Distributed Autonomous Corporations.\nThe evening concluded with an update from Austin and Beccy Craig from \u201cLife on Bitcoin.\u201d Austin and Beccy began married life with the challenge of living solely on Bitcoin for 90 days. Austin and Beccy provided a recap of some of the challenges yet also benefits of using solely Bitcoin and shared of plans to travel around the world and back on Bitcoin for their final month of the challenge. The conference was an overall success and Bitcoin Magazine was privileged to not only serve as a sponsor but meet with subscribers and get some additional magazines into the hands of readers!

{"title": "Silk Road Shut Down, Alleged Owner Arrested", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/silk-road-shut-down-alleged-owner-arrested-1380753284/", "birthday": "Oct 2, 2013  6:34 PM EST", "date": "2013-10-02 23:34:00", "content": "The Silk Road, the largest black market site on the Tor network, has been shut down by the United States\u2019 Federal Bureau of Investigation, and its alleged owner, Ross William Ulbrecht, arrested in San Francisco and charged with narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy. With the closure of the site, the FBI has also made the largest seizure of bitcoins, or indeed Bitcoin-related funds, to date: 26000 BTC, or $3.6 million.\nRoss Ulbricht appears to have a public LinkedIn profile, where he describes himself as an \u201cinvestment adviser and entrepreneur\u201d who \u201clove[s] learning and using theoretical constructs to better understand the world around me\u201d and now wishes to \u201cuse economic theory as a means to abolish the use of coercion and agression amongst mankind.\u201d \u201cJust as slavery has been abolished most everywhere,\u201d he writes, \u201cI believe violence, coercion and all forms of force by one person over another can come to an end. The most widespread and systemic use of force is amongst institutions and governments, so this is my current point of effort. The best way to change a government is to change the minds of the governed, however. To that end, I am creating an economic simulation to give people a first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force.\u201d\nUnfortunately for Ulbricht, it seems like it is systemic force that is giving people a first-hand experience of what it is like to live in a world without him. However, the online drug community is unlikely to fall apart, in much the same way that the filesharing community only grew stronger once Napster disappeared. Black Market Reloaded, located at http://5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion (link works using the Tor browser only) is currently the main alternative, with Sheep Market at http://sheep5u64fi457aw.onion coming up as a close second. The loss of Silk Road will likely give rise to many more sites springing up in its wake, especially with the open source BitWasp project providing operators with a codebase to start from. Perhaps we may even see a decentralized alternative, which will survive without any central bottleneck that could be taken down. But the biggest problem in the short term will be trust. Over the past two and a half years, there have been many reputations formed on the site and recorded on Silk Road\u2019s database, and much of this information is now gone. On the positive side, however, Silk Road has always supported sellers and buyers getting into contact with each other over email, and most reputable sellers have GPG public keys, meaning that they can still send messages that others can verify came from them, and thus maintain their reputations as the drug community moves to other sides.\nCryptic Consequences\nFor crypto-economy enthusiasts, there are two main questions. First, how did Ulbricht get caught? In a Forbes article on the subject, Alex Konrad writes: \u201cThe full complaint linked to above is worth a read, but it appears that agents found Ulbricht after Canadian border authorities routinely checked a package intended for his San Francisco home and discovered nine fake identification cards within, which Ulbricht allegedly was seeking to obtain to rent more servers to power Silk Road as it massively expanded.\u201d From here, we can see two large mistakes. First, Dread Pirate Roberts did far too much himself. The number one rule of staying hidden is, well, being hidden. Purchasing a large number of servers with fake ID is exactly the wrong the thing to do. The correct solution would have been to do only the sensitive wallet and private information handling in-house and outsource as much as possible to third parties. Second, Dread Pirate Roberts actually stayed inside the United States, the single most hostile jurisdiction with regard to drug policy, the whole time.\nBut there is also another piece of evidence mentioned in the complaint. In early 2011, a forum user \u201caltoid\u201d made posts on shroomery.org and bitcointalk.org attempting to generate interest in the site; \u201cHas anyone seen Silk Road yet?\u201d, one post reads, \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like an anonymous amazon.com. I don\u2019t think they have heroin on there, but they are selling other stuff\u2026\u201d Later on, altoid on Bitcointalk made a post on the forum asking for an \u201cIT pro in the Bitcoin community\u201d to hire in connection with \u201ca venture backed Bitcoin startup company\u201d, asking interested users to reply to \u201crossulbricht at gmail dot com\u201d. This pattern is a common one seen in cryptography: systems like public key cryptography, Tor and Bitcoin are proven time and time again to be robust, and even the criminal complaint points out that Tor makes it \u201cpractically impossible\u201d to physically locate users or servers and mentions Silk Road\u2019s internal Bitcoin \u201ctumbler\u201d used to further anonymize users; rather, it is always through some non-technical mistake that the information gets leaked. Being a crypto-entrepreneur is a full-time job; it is simply too risky to run any kind of substantial anonymous operation by night and be an ordinary businessman by day.\nSecond, are the users themselves safe? The answer here is, it depends. Most professional sellers use GPG public key encryption, so those buyers who know how to use GPG can send their private shipping data to sellers such that any intermediaries only see it in an encrypted format. Those who have not figured out how to use GPG, however, may be in trouble. In theory, Silk Road deletes the info as soon as possible. However, it is entirely possible that the major drug sites currently left standing, Black Market Reloaded and Sheep Market, has already been compromised by law enforcement, which is monitoring and recording any shipping information that buyers put in. Thus, what this case shows clearly is just how valuable easy-to-use client side encryption software can be; if the Tor browser had included some kind of GPG utility by default, this issue would be much less consequential (although full safety is impossible since law enforcement can always create their own fake seller accounts to harvest data even without compromising the site, and various kinds of man-in-the-middle attacks are possible if users are not careful about which key they encrypt with). Ultimately, the only truly secure Silk Road will likely come in the form of some kind of plugin to Bitmessage.\nNot Such A Perfect Martyr\nUnfortunately, those who see Dread Pirate Roberts as a martyr for the cause of personal freedoms with respect to psychoactive substances will be sorely disappointed. According to the complaint, Ulbrecht is not just a drug marketplace operator; he was also responsible for murder, or at least attempted murder, by proxy. The complaint begins:\nBeginning on March 13, 2013, a Silk Road vendor known as \u201cFriendlyChemist\u201d began sending threats to DPR through Silk Road\u2019s private message system. In these messages, FriendlyChemist states that he had a long list of real names and addresses of Silk ROad vendors and customers that he had obtained from hacking into the computer of another, larger Silk Road vendor. FriendlyChemist threatened to publish the information on the internet unless DPR gave him $500,000, which FriendlyChemist indicated he needed to pay off his narcotics suppliers.\nOver the next few days, FriendlyChemist leaked enough of the information to convince DPR that he was serious. On March 27, he wrote to Silk Road member redandwhite:\nIn my eyes, FriendlyChemist is a liability and I wouldn\u2019t mind if he was executed \u2026 I\u2019m not sure how much you already know about the guy, but I have the following info and am waiting on his address.\nThe victim was a resident of White Rock, British Columbia, Canada, and had a wife and three children. On March 29:\nI would like to put a bounty on his head if it isn\u2019t too much trouble for you. What would be an adequate amount to motivate you to find him?\nA payment of 1670 BTC (~$150,000) was soon sent and soon after that redandwhite updated: \u201cYour problem has been taken care of. Rest assured he won\u2019t be blackmailing anyone ever again. Ever.\u201d It appears that redandwhite sent a picture to confirm the kill, which DPR received, confirmed and deleted. However, Canadian law enforcement does not have evidence of any Canadian resident with the victim\u2019s name, or of any death in White Rock around that time; we may need to wait a while longer before that particular mystery gets resolved.\nHowever, there is also a second complaint, this time from the state of Maryland, that DPR also paid for another hit, this time for a crime much smaller than intending to release thousands of names and addresses to the public and law enforcement for potential arrest. The complaint reads:\n> DPR communicated with the undercover cop via the Internet, and told the UC that the Employee had been arrested by law enforcement [earlier this employee had been the victim of an undercover sting operation] and that the Employee had stolen funds from other Silk Road users. DPR asked the undercover cop to arrange for the employee to be beaten and forced to return the money, stating specifically: \u201cI\u2019d like him beat up, then forced to return the bitcoins he stole back, like sit him down at his computer and make him do it.\u201d\nBut then things got worse:\n> Can you change the order to execute rather than torture? \u2026 [the Employee] was on the inside for a while, and now that he\u2019s arrested I\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll give up info \u2026 [I have] never killed a man before, but it is the right move in this case.\nAfter some negotiation before the \u201chit\u201d, the undercover cop created and sent DPR several staged photos of the victim being \u201ctortured\u201d and \u201ckilled\u201d. DPR\u2019s words after the kill included:\n> [I\u2019m] a little disturbed, but I\u2019m OK. I\u2019m new to this kind of thing is all \u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done the wrong thing \u2026 I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll call on you again at some point, though I hope I won\u2019t have to. > I\u2019m pissed I had to kill him, but what\u2019s done is done \u2026 I just can\u2019t believe he was so stupid \u2026 I wish more people had some integrity\nLooking Forward\nSo what will the future be? In the near and mid-term future, we can certainly expect to see others opening up drug sites, taking Silk Road\u2019s demise as an opportunity. Research into infrastructure like decentralized webs of trust is likely to increase; just like the successor to Napster was the decentralized BitTorrent, the true successor to Silk Road will likely need to be decentralized as well. Will it happen? The tools are out there. BitMessage exists, Namecoin, so all the ingredients for a web of trust are in place. The next level will be to set up a decentralized marketplace. That is simply a matter of creating a simple application-specific message protocol on top of BitMessage and then creating a graphical user interface for it. The web of trust, necessary to combat fraud, will also need to become a decentralized protocol. If someone wants to implement it all, they can.\nAs for Bitcoin itself, however, there will be another big question: will Bitcoin survive the loss of Silk Road? There are many who claim that the practical value of Bitcoin is essentially entirely that of buying drugs with it; if Silk Road goes down, and Bitcoin prospers, that will be the ultimate definitive proof that that is false. Indeed, the loss of Silk Road may even make Bitcoin more palatable to mainstream businesses and accelerate adoption, as the arrest may placate law enforcement agencies around the world and make them believe that Bitcoin\u2019s anonymity is not as strong as they may have previously believed. Bitcoin\u2019s public relations department is succeeding at sending the right message to law enforcement already; the complaint did not make any significant attempt to criticize Bitcoin and even specifically said: \u201cBitcoins are not illegal in and of themselves and have known legitimate uses\u201d.\nFurthermore, with the recent collapse of MtGox\u2019s market share, the Bitcoin economy has lost one of its major centralized points of failure, and now that Silk Road too is gone it is difficult to see if Bitcoin has any truly centralized points left. Nearly every service now has replacements that are comparable to it in size \u2013 in the exchange market, MtGox and BitStamp, in the payment processor market BitPay, Coinbase and BIPS, and in the crypto-drug market Black Market Reloaded and Sheep Market, so once the shock of the loss of Silk Road passes the economy will actually be less vulnerable to individual shocks going forward.\nIt has long been said that crypto-anonymity is only something that functions well at small scales; the larger one gets, the harder it becomes to untraceably mix one\u2019s bitcoins, the larger one\u2019s real-world trace becomes, and the larger the incentive for law enforcement and blackmailers alike to look through the evidence and search for weaknesses. Today, it was fake IDs and an email address. Tomorrow, it may be one\u2019s writing style. Later on, it might be a correllation between one\u2019s home electricity and internet bandwidth usage and one\u2019s forum login records. But then again, as the state of the current financial system reminds us all too well, maybe the impossibility of staying private and getting too big, and the traceability that Bitcoin offers at such scales as compared to centralized systems, is actually generally a good thing.", "year": 2013, "month": 10, "day": 2}

A new startup has just surfaced with one vision: to educate our children about Bitcoin. How will this happen, you ask? That is where The Bitcoin Academy and Bitcoin Bootcamp come in. The idea is very simple and will allow students of all ages to learn about Bitcoin and Cryptography in both the classroom and online.According to founder Morgan Rockwell, \u201cThe Bitcoin Academy has a goal of creating a network of classrooms online & in the real world including real dedicated classrooms in major cities around the world. We will organize business clubs and foundations, meetups and conferences, seminars and hangouts, all dedicated to teaching the world of Crypto Currency and Bitcoin as a new means of mathematical & financial expression and freedom.\u201d\u201cThere are actually two businesses, The Bitcoin Academy and Bitcoin Bootcamp. The vision for these began when I started thinking about how to introduce Bitcoin to the brick and mortar world. I started creating devices that are open source in both hardware and software that could make a machine accept Bitcoin. I feel that The Bitcoin Academy is a priority to all Bitcoin supporters. I feel there is a missing aspect of education that teaches kids the benefits and how to use Bitcoin. We need to get back to teaching kids math and science again.\u201dThis exciting idea focuses on partnering with schools around the nation. It will start by creating classes dedicated to Bitcoin and crypto currency, then will partner with a school who adds the class to their curriculum. The first classes are planned to be held in Portland, Oregon schools by contacting and partnering with district trustees in the area. The Bitcoin Academy will focus on partnering with schools K-12 while Bitcoin Bootcamp will focus on adopting classes into private schools. The adoption of The Bitcoin Academy curriculum in a single school will allow them to create similar classes in other schools around the nation, and the curriculum will increase as the number of supporting schools increases.Although The Bitcoin Academy is certainly in the early stages, there is no question that the instruction of Bitcoin and crypto currency in schools would be a huge breakthrough for the Bitcoin community. This idea will require teachers, volunteers, the support of schools, and support from individuals. Currently The Bitcoin Academy has a few volunteer teachers and is receiving resumes from teachers interested in teaching at the school. In the future, Morgan hopes The Bitcoin Academy and Bitcoin Bootcamp will be franchised throughout the nation. \u201cAll of this takes money, or better yet Bitcoin.\u201d\nThe Bitcoin Academy is accepting donations to help make the idea a reality. The donations made will go to creating an entire curriculum and providing students with necessary \u2018school supplies\u2019 (mining hardware, labs, networks, computers, etc.) while bringing insight into the evolving world of money, computers, and business. \u201cThe goal is to have the facility and business completely set up before the end of the year.\u201d \u00a0This will all occur in a school setting and will be open to any student.\nAll donations to The Bitcoin Academy can be made at The Bitcoin Academy website, GoFundMe, or by using Bitcoin Starter.\nhttp://www.gofundme.com/43q6uo\nwww.thebitcoinacademy.com", "year": 2013, "month": 8, "day": 30}

Tradehill established that record in March of this year when it relaunched after an eleven month hibernation, distinguishing it from the host of exchanges that have closed permanently.\nThe San Francisco based company made the news last week when it announced it was opening an account with the Internet Archive Federal Credit Union. In the emails shared by customers on Wednesday, Tradehill stated that it was \u201csuspending its relationship\u201d with the IAFCU, as well as suspending Bitcoin trading. The IAFCU had notably facilitated the return of customers funds stuck in financial purgatory after another Bitcoin exchange, Bitfloor, was left out in the cold by its bank.\nTradehill has previously touted a catered to strict regulatory compliance by only allowing customers with over $10,000 to open a trading account and rigorously applying \u201cKnow Your Customer\u201d rules. The most recent suspension of operations by a company providing a conduit between the legacy financial system and Bitcoin is part of a growing trend in the United States that sees entrepreneurs stymied by a banking and financial environment wary of interacting with Bitcoin.\nIn the statement on their website, Tradehill cited \u201cbanking and regulatory issues\u201d as the reason for their hiatus, but did not clarify the nature of those issues. The announcement also noted that Tradehill had only just this month registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a Money transmitter. FinCEN\u2019s Records show that the registration was received on August 13, 2013. However, business engaged in money transmission are also required to obtain licences from each state they do business in, which often involve prohibitive surety bonds and application fees.\nSeparately, the email to customers indicated that Tradehill would be able to allow withdrawal of a customers US dollar account balance via bank wire, and encouraged them to contact the personal account manager that Tradehill assigns to each account holder. Both announcements indicate that the company plans to resume operations after it resolves its unspecified difficulties.\nUPDATE\nTradehill CEO Jered Kenna has posted an announcement on reddit noting that the IAFCU \u201chas experienced operational and regulatory issues and we are no longer able to continue our relationship at this time.\u201d\nHe ended the announcement by saying \u201cWe look forward to resuming operations soon.\u201d\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1lds68/tradehill_temporarily_suspending_trading_iafcu/\nThe full text of the announcement found on Tradehill\u2019s website is included below for posterity.\n\u2014\nTradehill Moving Forward\nMany of you have come to know Tradehill as the digital currency exchange of choice over the last six months. We have appreciated your patronage and have delighted in providing a reliable service to help you reach deep liquidity in the Bitcoin market. We have recently made the decision to temporarily suspend trading on the Tradehill platform, due to banking and regulatory issues. This decision has not been made lightly and we regret having to take such action. However, we embrace the silver lining of our situation and plan to take this opportunity to upgrade, improve, and polish our trading platform.\nTradehill registered with FinCEN in August 2013 and is actively engaging with banks and regulators to continue development of future business products and practices.\nWe would like to thank our clients, current and past partners, supporters, and advocates for all their continued support.

Put yourself into a world in which banks charge $20 to $50 to manage an international wire transfer, but hardly make a profit on it. Conceptualize a world in which banks delay domestic ACH transfers up to three days, in a large part to reduce fraud risk. Imagine a world in which taking on just one new customer necessitates the hiring of another employee. If you\u2019re a commercial bank, these problems are likely all too real and familiar to you. Your costs are continuously rising, but your clearing and compliance infrastructure hasn\u2019t changed. Well I have some good news for you: Bitcoin is going to lower your network and compliance costs by 90%, and I guarantee you will be using it within ten years or less.You\u2019re probably wondering how this could be possible when Bitcoin is a non-dollar currency with a payment flow that you can\u2019t trace. This widely publicized description doesn\u2019t understand Bitcoin\u2019s underlying potential, and the controversial headlines surrounding our industry don\u2019t give light to the services that will make Bitcoin usable by institutions. Most talking heads focus on Bitcoin as an anonymous currency, when it is more accurately a robust, traceable payment network. The infrastructure around it is still in its early days, but an army of companies is working to make Bitcoin the most suitable payment network in the world. To boot, the leading companies in the space are placing huge importance on establishing credible AML programs that are in line with those of other financial services companies you currently bank.Bitcoin is a globalized clearing network that works exceptionally well. Right now, this network almost exclusively clears transactions for payments in bitcoins. However, companies are emerging that will enable people to send dollar-denominated payments to their friends and businesses via the Bitcoin network. You may look at this industry as low-cost competition, but you\u2019d be wrong. You will soon be the primary beneficiary of Bitcoin, preferring it to the networks you currently use. What you don\u2019t yet know is that in this process, we will help you save billions by lowering your AML compliance costs.Although many are skeptical of Bitcoin\u2019s legitimacy, my conversations with law enforcement officials suggest that Bitcoin isn\u2019t being used for any sizeable criminal activities. Criminals realize that all transactions are public, left to be discovered at a later date. Alongside a robust AML program, Bitcoin is already far safer to accept than the cash you currently accept deposits of. Looking forward, emerging technologies that are already in development will make AML compliance for Bitcoin transfers more cost-effective and accurate than compliance methods associated with other networks. The Bitcoin exchanges that you are afraid to bank will become a key part of a system that enable you to automate 90% of your AML compliance work. You will love your Bitcoin exchange, and you will probably acquire one someday too.So how do we get there? Banks\u2019 support of Bitcoin companies can help move both of our industries forward. If you\u2019re approached by a Bitcoin company with a solid AML program and a good reputation, meet with its founders. Consider banking it \u2013 many companies in the space have surprisingly low AML risk profiles despite the \u201cBitcoin stigma\u201d they receive. We also understand that the opinion of regulators impacts your decision-making, and their viewpoints are evolving as they learn about Bitcoin. I haven\u2019t come across any regulators who are opposed to Bitcoin, only ones who don\u2019t yet understand it. By genuinely understanding our technology, you too can help move the world\u2019s financial infrastructure forward.\nAbout the Author\nCoinsetter", "year": 2013, "month": 8, "day": 30}
{"title": "Bitcoin Foundation Individual Seat Candidate Transcription: Ryan Deming", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-foundation-individual-seat-candidate-transcription-ryan-deming/", "birthday": "Sep 3, 2013  10:19 AM EST", "date": "2013-09-03 15:19:00", "content": "Adam B. Levine (Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin):\u00a0Please introduce yourself and give a brief overview of what you hope to accomplish with your candidacy.\nRyan Deming:\u00a0My name is Ryan Deming. I have a JD MBA from USC, University of Southern California. And I am the managing partner of a commodities trading advisor, or CTA, which is located in Los Angeles. I have about 10 years of experience as a registered investment advisor, or RIA, and as a CTA, which means that I have about a decade of compliance experience dealing with regulators and exchanges, broker dealers, futures commissions merchants. And I think that strongly differentiates me from other candidates.\nMy goals are as follows. First, I want to convince the securities exchanges and regulators to accept Bitcoin as collateral. And second, to do that, I think we need to educate them and the general public on Bitcoin and virtual currencies, in general. I see my primary aim as the second piece, because it is really a prerequisite to accomplishing the first piece. In other words, in order to get the regulators and exchanges to accept Bitcoin, I think we must educate them about Bitcoin. If elected to the board, I will spend most of my time doing that.\nLTB:\u00a0Why do you want to serve on the Foundation Board?\nRD:\u00a0We are starting an introducing broker that will give Bitcoiners access to commodities, pools, and hedge funds. But I\u2019d like to see the industry go a lot farther than that. I think that\u2019s just a start. I hope that investment opportunities for Bitcoiners will some day open up much more broadly. So that, for instance, people can use Bitcoins to invest in stocks or bonds or manage futures directly.\nSimply put, my platform is this, I want to help get us to the point where Bitcoin is accepted as collateral on the securities and futures exchanges.\nIt\u2019s a lofty goal, but I think in order for a currency to be truly valuable it must not only be a viable medium of exchange, but also it should be possible to use the currency to gain access to traditional investments. Some investment vehicles, whether hedge funds or commodities pools, for instance, they can accept subscriptions in whatever forms they choose, but the average person doesn\u2019t have access to these vehicles, because their minimums are too high. The average person can only hope to make investments through an IRA, or securities account, or perhaps a managed futures account.\nThe rules for what can be deposited to these accounts to satisfy margin requirements, they\u2019re highly regulated. Traditionally you can use domestic currencies, or foreign currencies, or domestic government bonds, or foreign government bonds as collateral, but that\u2019s it. If we are going to make Bitcoin truly competitive, as a currency, I think that we must change that.\nLTB:\u00a0What makes you qualified for the position?\nRD:\u00a0My experience as an RIA and as a commodity trading advisor, I think, qualifies me for this position. I understand that for an industry to succeed, you have to work with the regulators so that the industry has a culture of compliance.\nWe were clearing our fund with Bear Stearns back in 2008 just months before the firm went under. We had a lot of our clients clearing their accounts at\u00a0MF Global\u00a0right before MF Global\u2019s imminent collapse. We tried to get them to move their funds out. Unfortunately, it\u2019s hard to get people to move even when there are signs that their broker dealer, or FCM, might be insolvent.\n\nSo it ends up costing people a lot of money. It ends up costing the industry a lot in terms of reputation if the industry isn\u2019t properly regulated. So one of my goals will be to make sure that we are appropriately regulated and that we are not left to our own devices. In order for us to succeed as an industry, I think, we need to work with the regulators to make sure that we are regulated in the correct way.\nLTB:\u00a0Do you believe there is a right and wrong way to use a Bitcoin?\nRD:\u00a0It is an interesting question. I personally don\u2019t, but I think it matters less what I think or what we think and more what the regulators think. If, for AML reasons, they don\u2019t want Bitcoin transactions to be anonymous then we need to make sure all the virtual currencies exchanges and MSB\u2019s take the [time to] know your customer rules seriously. In order to reach the point where Bitcoin can be used as collateral on securities and futures exchanges, which is what I want to see happen, I think we need to work really hard at swaying public opinion in our favor. And the only way to do that is to encourage a culture of compliance across the entire industry. In other words, the right way to use Bitcoins is to use it in a way that is not obviously inconsistent with how the regulators want us to be using it. Bitcoin\u2019s reputations is important and I think we need to remember that.\nLTB:\u00a0What are your views on Bitcoins software development?\nRD:\u00a0I\u2019ll leave that up to Gavin and the other programmers who are involved with development. \u00a0I\u2019m not strictly a software guy, I\u2019m more of a finance guy. That\u2019s not entirely true. I do have 10 years of experience building quantitative trading models in Matlab using SQL also. And I\u2019ve fiddled around with HTML and PHP a bit, but I\u2019m less interested in the software side of Bitcoin, and much more interested in its potential in the financial services industry. I think if we can get the financial services industry to embrace Bitcoin, then it\u2019s potentially much more valuable to all of us and to anybody who adopts the currency.\nSo I think the question is, how do we get the regulators and exchanges to treat the virtual currency the same way as fiat money? For better or for worse how do we get that sort of equal treatment. That\u2019s really what I\u2019m focused on.\nLTB:\u00a0Do you have plans to work with the Bitcoin Community, if so how will you deal with the diversity of opinion?\nRD:\u00a0\u00a0Yes, I would like to get more involved with the community. For me running for the board seems to be a good way to do that. Hopefully, after this campaign all of you will know me and be comfortable enough with me to approach me, if I don\u2019t introduce myself to you first. This is all relatively new to me. I still have a lot of people to meet, and I\u2019m looking forward to that. But, at any rate, I don\u2019t see diversity of opinion as much of a problem.\nFor me, if I\u2019m elected, I understand that my job would be to listen to what everybody has to say and just do the best that I can to listen to everybody has to say. And just do the best that I can to advocate on behalf of the entire community.\nLTB:\u00a0Should the Foundation hire a lobbyist? If yes, why and where should they lobby?\nRD:\u00a0No, I don\u2019t think so. Our job as board members should be, one of our primary roles, should be to lobby for Bitcoin. The decisions that regulators make are largely relationship driven. I don\u2019t think we need to convince legislators themselves to embrace Bitcoin. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s our audience really. We should be meeting with the regulators directly. And I think the best way to do that is to meet with them face to face. First casually at conferences then by invitation.\nWe have learned in the investments realm that this is how things really get done. If you are going to influence the regulators in their decision making, you first basically have to build friendships with them and treat them as equals and as friends. They understand, if they\u2019ve been at it long for long enough, that they are as responsible for us, as the professionals, as they are for consumers. The average person may not be aware of that, but the regulators are well aware of it. An event like MF global can take out an entire industry. And that\u2019s what keeps the regulators up at night, I think.\nI think they\u2019ll listen to us, but I don\u2019t think the lobbyist is the right answer although you might convince me otherwise.\nLTB:\u00a0If you had to change one thing about the Bitcoin Foundation, what would it be and why?\nRD:\u00a0More conferences, I guess. I mean I say this in jest, but the conference in San Jose was a great experience for us. I\u2019d like to see more of them. I know they are a lot of work for Lindsey. \u00a0But it was a great experience. More of them couldn\u2019t hurt anything.\nSeriously, though, I don\u2019t know the Foundation well enough yet to, I think, competently recommend changes. From what I\u2019ve seen, everybody is accessible and everything seems to be moving in the right direction. I think we just need to keep working hard, keep working together, and hopefully our industry will someday achieve its lofty goals.\nIf you have enjoyed this interview, you can find the other candidates interviews here:\nAaron LasherBen DavenportChristian KammlerDmitry (Rassah) MurashchikDuncan Goldie-ScotElizabeth PloshayJoerg PlatzerLuke-JrNilam DoctorNoah SilvermanTrace Mayer\n", "year": 2013, "month": 9, "day": 3}
{"title": "Introducing the Exchanges: Coinbase (Part 1)", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/introducing-the-exchanges-coinbase-part-1-1378059449/", "birthday": "Sep 1, 2013  2:17 PM EST", "date": "2013-09-01 19:17:00", "content": "See also: our \u201cIntroducing The Exchanges\u201d article on BitStamp.\nIn the year since the site first launched, Coinbase has come to be one of the most important and influential companies in the US Bitcoin economy. The company was originally founded by Brian Armstrong in the summer of 2012, and started out with a simple mission: make Bitcoin as easy to use as possible for the masses. At first, the company offered little more than basic merchant tools and a Bitcoin wallet. Even still, however, Brian Armstrong\u2019s past as a fraud-prevention engineer at Airbnb earned the company credibility, and in September it received a $600,000 funding round from a number of high-profile investors, including Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. Fortunately, the original investors\u2019 confidence proved to be well-founded. In October 2012, the company launched a new service, allowing anyone in the US to buy and sell bitcoins straight from their bank account with a few clicks of a mouse. As soon as the service was announced, volume picked up quickly. By January 2013, the company was processing $1 million in buys and sells every month, and weeks after that volume became so high that the company was shutting down daily because it simply could not come up with enough bitcoins to sell.\nOver the next few months, volume continued to consistently increase, and the company also brought a number of large companies, including Reddit, the popular dating site OkCupid and the Humble Bundle, into the Bitcoin economy with its merchant tools. In May 2013, the company received its second investment round of $5 million, with money from the Silicon Valley venture capital fund Union Square Ventures, Ribbit Capital, SV Angel and Funders Club. Today, Coinbase is processing one million dollars of Bitcoin buys and sells every day \u2013 roughly a quarter of all Bitcoin trade on exchanges put together.\nGoing In Depth\n\nIn order to buy and sell bitcoins with Coinbase, you first need to verify your phone number and your bank account. Verifying a phone number is a basic SMS confirmation; you enter your phone number, receive a text message containing a code, and must then enter the code in a textbox to confirm that you own the phone number. Verifying a bank account is somewhat more difficult, but Coinbase\u2019s interface tries hard to make the process as easy as possible. To go to the bank account verification form, navigate to \u201cBuy/Sell Bitcoin\u201d -> \u201cVerify A Bank Account\u201d -> \u201cLink A Bank Account\u201d in Coinbase\u2019s interface. At that point, a form will ask you to enter the routing number, account number and full name on your bank account. Once you are done that, you are presented with two options: instant verification and delayed verification. If you select instant verification, you need to enter the online ID and password to your bank account, and Coinbase verifies your bank account instantly by logging into it. If you are not comfortable giving Coinbase your banking data, the alternative is challenge-response verification, where Coinbase credits your bank account with two small amounts and you need to fill in a form saying what the amounts are. However, the higher level of security provided by challenge-response verification comes at a price: you need to wait two or three days for the \u201cchallenge\u201d deposits to be credited to your bank account.\nOnce bank account verification and phone verification are complete, buying bitcoins is as easy as filling out a checkout form. Once you click \u201cConfirm\u201d, the money is debited from your bank account and your order is put into the queue to be processed. Buy orders usually take four business days to process, although Coinbase recently unveiled a feature that allows instant Bitcoin purchases for those who are willing to submit to a higher level of identity verification. The process for selling is roughly symmetrical, although there is no \u201cinstant sell\u201d feature; because of that way the traditional banking system works, waiting a few days to receive the USD credit to your bank account is unavoidable.\nCoinbase is certainly not for everyone. Unlike Bitcoin exchanges like MtGox and BitStamp, where users can submit orders and trade back and forth between Bitcoin and fiat currency internally, on Coinbase you can only trade between bitcoins and dollars in your bank account directly. This makes Coinbase useless for day traders and bots, which rely on the ability to trade back and forth many times per hour. Coinbase\u2019s limit of 10 BTC per day per customer (50 BTC per day with level 2 verification) also limits the exchange\u2019s utility for high-volume buyers and sellers. However, high-volume buyers and sellers and bots are not what Coinbase is targeting; rather, the company is focusing its efforts solely on making the purchasing and selling experience as simple and safe as possible for the average user. At Coinbase, there is no need to worry about choosing between different deposit methods, repeatedly logging in to one\u2019s account to check if a deposit was processed, and then figuring out whether one should place an instant order or a limit order; instead, buying and selling bitcoins is a simple click of a button.\nThe company has also had its share of problems with reliability. A number of people have complained about slow or lacking customer support, and others report having to wait over a week for their orders to process. Sometimes, customers would not receive their bitcoins at all; instead, their bank account payment would be refunded, and they would receive an email saying that the order had been cancelled for being too \u201chigh risk\u201c. Another problem that was common earlier in the year was that users trying to buy bitcoins would be turned away and told to come back the next day, as the bitcoins for the day were \u201csold out\u201c. However, in the past few months the number of complaints has reduced considerably, and for those complaints that do appear Coinbase employees are generally quick to respond.\nNavigating the Fine Line\nSome of the customer support issues at the beginning of the year can arguably be justly blamed on Coinbase itself; when the Bitcoin community started expanding rapidly between January and April 2013, Coinbase, like many other companies in the Bitcoin ecosystem, failed to act quickly enough to expand its customer support staff to meet the new requirements. However, what is often very much underappreciated is the sheer difficulty of the business that Coinbase is in: navigating the fine boundary between the fiat currency and Bitcoin worlds. For example, Coinbase frequently \u201cselling out\u201d of bitcoins in early 2013 was a result of the company\u2019s banking partner, which restricted the amount of money that the company could process daily to a percentage of their bank balance. When the company secured the $5 million investment round from Union Square Ventures, most of the money went straight into the company bank account, and the bank-imposed limit increased to the point where it was no longer a problem.\nAnother major issue that deserves explanation is that of delays and cancellations. The four-day delay in Coinbase\u2019s bitcoin buying process is introduced deliberately; this much is obvious from the simpler fact that Coinbase is able to waive the delay for customers that have submitted to level 2 verification. However, the delay and occasional cancellations are necessary to fight fraud. One of the most difficult aspects of handling the fiat/cryptocurrency boundary is that fiat currency payments are usually reversible, whereas Bitcoin payments are irreversible. In general, mixing the two is considered to be nearly impossible; every company that has tried to sell bitcoins for credit card payments has been crushed under the weight of \u201cchargeback fraud\u201d, where fraudulent buyers purchase bitcoins and then initiate a chargeback to get the (fiat) money back. Coinbase deals with bank transfers, where chargebacks are harder, but even still the company is forced to rely on advanced machine-learning algorithms to detect orders that are likely to be fraudulent. These algorithms look at features of an order, like the name, purchase amount, originating bank account and status of the customer, and attempt to detect which orders are likely to be fraudulent. An order can be flagged as high-risk, in which case it is rejected immediately, low-risk, in which case the order goes through, or medium-risk, in which case a human makes the final decision.\nAccording to Coinbase, waiting for four days to release the bitcoins is simply another necessary step to reduce the chargeback fraud to an acceptable level. If you submit to level 2 verification, then you become a much smaller risk, and so in that case Coinbase is willing to waive the waiting period. One common conspiracy theory is that Coinbase is manipulating cancellations for their own benefit; the claim is that Coinbase is cancelling orders if the price goes up during the four day waiting period, and pocketing the difference if the price goes down. However, Coinbase employees have gone on record multiple times saying that Coinbase buys the bitcoins as soon as you make the order, so the company does not stand to profit or lose from manipulating cancellations.\nCoinbase\u2019s \u201cinstant account verification\u201d option, which requires users to give Coinbase their bank account password to verify their account, has also aroused some controversy. Coinbase\u2019s defense is simple: the procedure is voluntary, and for those who do not wish to give Coinbase any private data there is the option of challenge-response verification as well. Furthermore, Coinbase itself is a highly reputable institution, with Union Square Ventures and a Reddit co-founder, among others, backing it with their investment money. The company takes special precautions with privacy, only using users\u2019 bank login information once to log into their accounts and then immediately forgetting the data. Some do argue that Coinbase is doing the financial community a disservice by legitimizing what is ultimately a highly dangerous practice if used by less reputable organizations; to this, Brian Armstrong\u2019s response is simple: there are plenty of people that want instant verification enough to trust Coinbase with their banking data, and this is the only way it can be done. \u201c60-70% of people use it,\u201d Armstrong says, \u201cso there is probably some value.\u201d\nAs far Coinbase\u2019s basic buy and sell Bitcoin service is concerned, at this point the core product is essentially settled. The company last added the instant verification option two months ago, and, aside from the convenience option of ordering bitcoins by SMS, the service has been essentially unchanged ever since. Volume did decrease slightly after the peak in April and May, but Coinbase usage is once again on the rise with roughly six percent growth every week; currently, the company processes about $1 million worth of combined Bitcoin buys and sells per day. Aside from perhaps doing additional advertising, there is little the company can do to speed up its growth; at this point, the only way forward is to focus on maintaining a reliable service and increasing its customer support staff as necessary. Rather, where Coinbase has chosen to innovate now is in the direction of its merchant services and its wallet, and in time these parts of its business may come to be just as important as its exchange.

Levine (Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin):\u00a0Please introduce yourself and give a brief overview of what you hope to accomplish with your candidacy.\nChristian Kammler:\u00a0\u00a0Im Christian Kammler, 35 years old, coming from Germany and running for the Individual Seat of the Bitcoin Foundation.\nI am doing this because nearly every aspect of human life is related to money and sometimes to the absence of money. And money is complicated and if we will tell our grandchildren in 40 years how the financial system worked in the early 21 century they will most likely not understand us, because hopefully it will be better and far more easy.\nFrom my point of view, Bitcoin is one of the biggest change management projects in human history affecting 7 Billion people on the planet.\nIt is running for 4 years now and hopefully it will continue the next 40 years.\nLTB:\u00a0Why do you want to serve on the Foundation Board?\nCK:\u00a0I got hooked on Bitcoin for several reasons, and I think that the Bitcoin Foundation has a historical chance to give the decentralized movement a single face.\nI do not want to talk about the enormous potential Bitcoin has as both as a technology as well as a global currency because we all know about it but would like to point out instead that there are threats, too.\nFrom my point of view, especially in this start-up phase we all are in the last years, the advantages are being far more euphorically discussed than the flaws.\nYet people should consider the threats, too and this has nothing to do with German Angst, but is due to the fact that the Bitcoin Foundation assumes responsibility when it starts to actively fight for the success of Bitcoin.\nI am ready to take this responsibility and as a Bitcoin spokesman would like to help the Bitcoin Foundation becoming recognized worldwide which is definitely not true today.\nLTB:\u00a0What makes you qualified for the position?\nCK:\u00a0Well, that depends on the expectations in the first place. I have some history with IT, which started trading computer games on cassette tapes as a child.\nAt the age of 15, I cracked my first (and last) video game and studied informatics when I was 20. I have a quite good understanding of the technology behind Bitcoin, because at that time I developed software using smartcards for digital signatures.\nAt 25, I founded my first company, and from 2004 onward, we started to focus on apps, which I think was quite visionary at that time.\nI know how to work in a Board from two perspectives: We had a Board with two Professors in my first company and during my time at Bassier, Bergmann & Kindlera\u00a0\u00a0200 employees agency having the digital Lead at Porsche for almost a decade I was Member of the Board myself.\nI have 9 years experience as a CEO in the digital industry, which is why I believe that I have a sound understanding of the challenges some of the industrial members are facing today.\nLTB:\u00a0Do you believe there is a right and wrong way to use a Bitcoin?\nCK:\u00a0No, I dont believe there is, as long as you use Bitcoin. And even if someone buys Bitcoins for dollars just to throw away the private key it will just reduce the availability of the commodity, which is likely to increase the price as long as there are people, who are willing to buy Bitcoin. And I expect that for the future.\nI am more concerned and thinking of the Billions of fiat money in offshore and Swiss bank accounts, which are quite hard to move around, and Bitcoin is in fact a vehicle that can transport value fast, anonymously and around the planet.\nI do believe that the majority of the people on earth have good intentions. As long as this is reflected in the majority of the network power and in the majority of the transactions, everything is fine.\nWe do not live in a perfect world and crime does exist. Nobody can expect that Bitcoin is better than other currencies with regard to ethics, but Bitcoin will become attack-able if the relation of illegal activities will be too high in the future.\nI think that this risk can only be reduced by making it possible to pay daily expenses and therefore do legal transactions on a regular basis with Bitcoin.\nThis, however, is only a matter of When will this happen not if.\nLTB:\u00a0What are your views on Bitcoins software development?\nCK:\u00a0There is still a lot of work to do, because what we see today is just the beginning of a hopefully long success story. And if this train moves on in the right direction, we all see the beginning of an even bigger development next year.\nCurrently, there is a quite small core developer team, and I would appreciate it if it gets bigger and more international. It would be great if the communication between the community and the core team gets better and more transparent, for example regarding the decisions what code contribution is accepted and which not.\nOn the whole, the cooperation worked out quite well, even in times when software bugs popped up. That\u2019s why I am quite optimistic that this will work out in the future too.\nLast weekend, I visited an Open Source Conference here in Germany, and it was quite interesting to see how software developers from other projects see the Bitcoin development.\nTo keep a long story short: Bitcoin is open source and will stay open source and therefore the community should regulate itself. If this doesnt work the Bitcoin Foundation could try to mediate and, if accepted by the community, this could work.\nLTB:\u00a0Do you have plans to work with the Bitcoin Community, if so how will you deal with the diversity of opinions contained therein?\nCK:\u00a0From the perspective of a software developer, I think the best way is to offer interfaces and to connect to more people around the planet. This would support and be in line with the decentralized approach.\nApart from that, I believe it is possible to give incentives to the community for reaching milestones, which could ultimately lead into some great kind of public/private partnership.\nThe German Federal Government has recognized Bitcoin as private Money, which was widely noted around the world: During the next\u00a0\n\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20141012064827/http://www.bitcoin-konferenz.de/\n\n\nThe German Marketplace\u00a0Bitcoin.de\u00a0has an agreement with the Fidor Bank, which in the next weeks will allow [users] to do real time trading from Euro to Bitcoin and back within seconds. I think this is groundbreaking, if I compare this to other marketplaces around the world.\nSo I think we can all learn a lot from each other by simply get in touch exchange information.\nThat is exactly what I would like to do.\nLTB:\u00a0Should the Foundation hire a lobbyist? If yes, why and where should they lobby?\nCK:\u00a0No, never ever.\nAnd maybe it is just because I have a different understanding of the word lobbyist, that\u2019s why I would like to explain it a bit more deeply, even if it blows 90 seconds.\nLet\u2019s imagine that we hire an experienced lobbyist and he/she starts working in Washington DC. \u00a0We then would have the situation that an employee of the Bitcoin Foundations gets paid to influence the opinion of democratically elected members of the congress to one side.\nAnd I wonder: what could be the best result to be achieved? Everyone can google for Monsanto Protection Act and I think this is result of good lobbyism.\nThe Open Source Project Bitcoin, however, does not need a lobbyist. This was true in the past, this is true today and hopefully this will be true in the future.\nBitcoin as a currency needs transparency and education.\nIf corporations [want to] do lobbyism then this is their own investment. Facebook has employees in Berlin just to inform German politicians about data privacy. But is Facebook really a company in symbolizing data privacy? Everyone should answer this for himself.\nI appreciate that on Monday members of the Bitcoin Foundation met at the US Treasury Department with members of the Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the FBI, IRS, Federal Reserve, FDIC, OCC and Homeland Security Department. I don\u2019t know if even the Secret Service was really at this meeting and if yes, why? Is Bitcoin a threat to the President or do they want to pay hookers next time more discreetly?\nI think it\u2019s desirable that if members of the Foundation participate at such meetings that there would a press notification or at least a protocol of the results. And if this was not possible, because it is not allowed to be talked about, what happened then? This is exactly the reason why I am against lobbyism.\nIn one sentence: Lobbyism: no. Education: yes. Information: yes. Transparency: yes.\nLTB:\u00a0If you had to change one thing about the Bitcoin Foundation, what would it be and why?\nCK:\u00a0Going global thats it.\nCurrently the majority of the Board Members of the Bitcoin Foundation are from the United States.\nI am aware of about 50 million in venture capital which went into mostly US startups related to Bitcoin in the last 12 months.\nPlease dont get me wrong: I think every investment into any open peer-to-peer crypto currency is welcomed.\nGoing global means that on every continent there should be a local chapter and the Bitcoin Foundation should have a true international board, which is elected democratically from people who own Bitcoin, no matter how much Bitcoin they own. I think this is too visionary right now, but I would appreciate it to see it happening in the mid-terms.\nIf you have enjoyed this interview, you can find the other candidates interviews here:\nAaron LasherBen DavenportDmitry (Rassah) MurashchikDuncan Goldie-ScotElizabeth PloshayJoerg PlatzerLuke-JrNilam DoctorNoah SilvermanRyan DemingTrace Mayer", "year": 2013, "month": 9, "day": 3}

Levine (Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin):\u00a0Please introduce yourself and give a brief overview of what you hope to accomplish with your candidacy.\nJoerg Platzer:\u00a0My name is Joerg Platzer, I am a founding member of the Crypto Economics Consulting Group in Berlin which aims to smooth our societys transition to a crypto economy and to roll out Bitcoin in the real world and I run\u00a0Room77,the first bricks and mortar business in the world that accepted Bitcoin and which is nowadays a meeting point for Bitcoiners, Cypherpunks and Cryptonerds from all over Europe and even the world.\n\n\nI am financially independent and politically neutral. I am running for a seat on the board of the Foundation because I would like to make sure that the Foundation is an organisation that supports and fosters the whole global Bitcoin-economy, not merely a Silicon Valley Bitcoin Business Club. I believe the decision which way to go is being made now and probably with these elections.\nLTB:\u00a0Why do you want to serve on the Foundation Board?\nJP:\u00a0Because I see the rise of a society based on crypto economics as a once-in-a-lifetime chance to take part in shaping an entirely new system that has the potential to change a lot of things in our society for the better. Crypto currency is the central drumbeat of digitalisation and may well be a trigger for a new economic singularity. This is more exciting than anything else I have seen in my life and more fascinating than any paid job one could ever get. I cannot imagine a better field to devote all my creativity and productivity to.\nLTB:\u00a0What makes you qualified for the position?\nJP:\u00a0I have a deep understanding of crypto technology, business mechanisms in general and politics. Furthermore I have a 25 years background in hacktivism and civil rights projects and 20 years of experience in strategic corporate communications. So I can bring expertise and competencies to the board that are just not there right now. Also, I am capable of envisioning the impact of new technologies and to extrapolate their future development. But most importantly: my heart beats for the rise of a crypto economic society. That is my utmost first priority, not my business, not my career and no political agenda but the creation of a more free, transparent and just society based on crypto.\nLTB:\u00a0Do you believe there is a right and wrong way to use a Bitcoin?\nJP:\u00a0Morally speaking: money doesnt stink, as a German saying goes. There are right and wrong things one can do but if they involve money it doesnt matter if that money is made of paper, precious metals or cryptographic key pairs. Technically speaking: yes, there are precisely three wrong ways to use a Bitcoin: to not have it backed up, to not have it encrypted or to store it on someone elses server.\nLTB:\u00a0What are your views on Bitcoins software development?\nJP:\u00a0In regards of the direction of future software development I would like to see a few issues prioritised. The whole community agrees that decentralised exchange is one of the most important goals we need to reach. It is clear that the majority of the current board of directors of the Foundation does not really have any interest in putting energy and resources into that because that would drive a significant amount of business away from them. Enhanced anonymity through technologies like zero coin or decentralised or trustless mixing is as important as the securing of fungibility, so all coins are being treated the same. I would also like to encourage alternative implementations of the protocol like\u00a0libbitcoin.\nLTB:\u00a0Do you have plans to work with the Bitcoin Community, if so how will you deal with the diversity of opinion?\nJP:\u00a0I welcome diversity of opinion as I welcome diversity in every field and I believe we should foster diversity of opinion especially when we enter a new era like we are about to. I fully respect other peoples opinions as long as they dont interfere with third partys rights and I try to learn from them rather than ignore or negate them. As a discordian my only firm belief is that it is wrong to have firm beliefs. Incidentally, the lack of diversity of opinions on the current board of the Foundation is one of the reasons why Im running for one of their seats.\nLTB:\u00a0Should the Foundation hire a lobbyist? If yes, why and where should they lobby?\nJP:\u00a0Clearly no. It is not important to go out and seek the approval of the legacy financial system and its regulators as crypto currency will most likely render them more or less unimportant in the long run anyways. Lobbying for Bitcoin with financial regulators makes as much sense as if Gutenberg would have lobbied for the printing press with the pope. Crypto currency will regulate the regulators. What we urgently need to do is consult and educate governments in regards to how they could participate in moderating the transition to a crypto economic society so that this transition will be as smooth as possible. That future can be bright but we will see a lot of collateral damage and victims along the way. It is the governments duty to do everything they can do to reduce that collateral damage and help making the way as little painful for society as possible. The sooner they understand that the better and I was never as willing to help a government as I am in this case.\nLTB:\u00a0If you had to change one thing about the Bitcoin Foundation, what would it be and why?\nJP: Internationalise it and take its center out of the United States. The USA is an absurdly over-regulated economy with a regime that is trying to abolish privacy in all aspects of peoples lives around the globe and thus the most hostile environment for Bitcoin on this planet. We really need to spread around the world and find more innovation-friendly and more privacy-friendly jurisdictions to cater to the decentralised nature of the decentralised system. This way and only this way we can come to a point where governments from different jurisdictions have to compete with each other and will send lobbyists to the Bitcoin community to make themselves more attractive to this huge emerging market and the people and businesses that develop it.\nIf you have enjoyed this interview, you can find the other candidates interviews here:\nAaron LasherBen DavenportChristian KammlerDmitry (Rassah) MurashchikDuncan Goldie-ScotElizabeth PloshayLuke-JrNilam DoctorNoah SilvermanRyan DemingTrace Mayer", "year": 2013, "month": 9, "day": 3}

Levine (Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin):\u00a0Please introduce yourself and give a brief overview of what you hope to accomplish with your candidacy.\nDmitry (Rassah) Murashchik:\u00a0Well, I\u2019m Dmitry Murashchik. I\u2019m known as Rassah on the forums, reddit, and pretty much everywhere else online. I\u2019ve been into Bitcoin since Spring of 2011. I\u2019ve been mining since about the Summer of 2011 until just a few months ago when it became unprofitable.\nI also sell through localbitcoins throughout the Baltimore/D.C. area, and I participate in meetups with locals. I\u2019m also the guy who has a Prius with the Bitcoin license plate, which has been great at getting people to come talk to me and ask questions.\nI also try to live as much on Bitcoin as I can. Basically, I convert my entire paycheck to bitcoins after all the retirement stuff gets taken out. I use bitcoin for whatever I can, and where I can\u2019t, use I use credit cards. Then I basically only sell coins to pay off my credit card bills.\nI\u2019m very much involved with the Bitcoin community. And I guess I\u2019m pretty well trusted there since I was selected as one of the forums treasurers and I\u2019m also the treasurer for the Bitcoin 100 charity fundraising organization, which I was recently put in charge of.\nAnd regarding what I hope to accomplish, I hope to be a liaison for the community, and basically, keep the community informed of what the Foundation\u2019s goals and actions are, and as a community representative for the Foundation, to gather opinions, concerns, and general interests for the Foundation to act on.\nLTB:\u00a0Why do you want to serve on the Foundation Board?\nDR:\u00a0I wish to represent the Bitcoin community, many of whom are involved with Bitcoin, but are not involved in any businesses and don\u2019t really have any ties outside the social networks they participate in.\nBasically, the gist that I get from the community is that the Foundation is more of a group of insiders that doesn\u2019t really answer to, or doesn\u2019t allow outsiders to participate; common users and such.\nSo, I\u2019d like to be a voice for the common user, the hobbyist, customer, and newbies who have recently discovered it, but also at the same time I\u2019d like to be able to advise and consult the Foundation on the general opinions and trends within the Bitcoin community.\nLTB:\u00a0What makes you qualified for the position?\nDR:\u00a0I\u2019m a well known and very well trusted member of the Bitcoin forums, subreddit, and various other social media. I also try to keep on top of everything Bitcoin related. I basically read and discuss Bitcoin articles, news, opinion posts, and all that stuff every single day.\nAnd I spend a lot of time discussing, correcting, and teaching many people about Bitcoins, and that\u2019s both online and in person.\nSo, basically, the position is for a representative of the Bitcoin community, and I\u2019m very much involved in that community.\nLTB:\u00a0Do you believe there is a right and wrong way to use a Bitcoin?\nDR:\u00a0The wrong way to use Bitcoin is on a malware infested Windows computer that has your wallet.dat with a password set to 123.\nOtherwise, Bitcoin is just an inanimate tool that allows people to do whatever they want or believe is ethical or right. If they are breaking the law or defrauding people, that\u2019s really for the laws and the people to decide whether what they are doing is wrong, not for Bitcoin itself.\nAnd if there\u2019s a law that happens to be wrong, or somebody considers something to be wrong which is actually not wrong, it\u2019s pretty much up to the people and the community to educate others and change the laws. Bitcoin itself, not really.\nLTB:\u00a0What are your views on Bitcoins software development?\nDR:\u00a0I think it\u2019s working well as is. The discussion and debates and suggestions for improvements are quite active. And I don\u2019t think there are any issues with it. Gavin mentioned his top priority right now is personal wallet security so I think he\u2019s definitely got his priorities right.\nAnd at the same time there\u2019s plenty of others working on different aspects and issues of Bitcoin so there\u2019s really no shortage of ideas or development.\nLTB:\u00a0Do you have plans to work with the Bitcoin Community? If so, how will you deal with the diversity of opinion?\nDR:\u00a0Well I already work with the Bitcoin community. I discuss and contribute to various community forums and media daily, and I love diversity of opinion since they make for very lively discussions.\nI mean if we were all like cypherpunk anarcho-capitalist exclusively-Bitcoin supporters, our community would be rather boring and stagnant.\u00a0 And with different opinions, they allow us to learn from others or to explore our own opinions from others point of view, and either change them or refine them to make them stronger.\nSo I pretty much welcome diversity of opinion and I welcome discussions.\nLTB:\u00a0Should the Foundation hire a lobbyist? If yes, why and where should they lobby?\nDR:\u00a0Yes, of course. Bitcoin is evolving into a major business segment and I think it really needs representation in the government. Basically, considering all the misinformed articles and opinion posts that are coming out all the time, with that being their only source of information, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if most politicians held rather misinformed and biased opinions of Bitcoin.\nSo it would be good to have a voice speaking directly to the politicians, representing this new market, and teaching them how it works.\nBasically, so they don\u2019t do silly things like accusing the Bitcoin Foundation of being a Money Transmitter.\nAs for where, I\u2019d say anywhere where the impact of politicians would be greatest. So, I guess, D.C. to start, then London, and Berlin. Though England really needs help with their Bitcoin environment, since it\u2019s really hard to get it and sell it there. Maybe it would be even better to start it there.\nLTB:\u00a0If you had to change one thing about the Bitcoin Foundation, what would it be and why?\nDR:\u00a0I think the Bitcoin Foundation may be too new to answer this question \u2018cause things are still constantly changing and evolving so it\u2019s kind of hard to pin down anything specific.\nSo I would just keep it growing and keep it changing as new ideas and obstacles come up.\nIf you have enjoyed this interview, you can find the other candidates interviews here:\nAaron LasherBen DavenportChristian KammlerDuncan Goldie-ScotElizabeth PloshayJoerg PlatzerLuke-JrNilam DoctorNoah SilvermanRyan DemingTrace Mayer", "year": 2013, "month": 9, "day": 3}

Levine (Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin):\u00a0Please introduce yourself and give a brief overview of what you hope to accomplish with your candidacy.\nDuncan Goldie-Scot:\u00a0My background is as a financial journalist, and then publisher, and \u00a0entrepreneur. I started various magazines in the financial technology space, so global magazines, and built up a publishing company. I trained as an economist and my interest has been, since then, really in payment systems, and civic society.\nSince 2007, I\u2019ve focused on development projects in Africa. And I was largely taken there by the success of the M-Pesa mobile payment service, which is now used by about 80% of the population in Kenya. I knew the people who designed that, and I\u2019ve written about that extensively in one of my newsletters.\nIn Africa, I\u2019m the founder and director of several companies including a microfinance bank, a credit scoring service using mobile phone data, and I\u2019m currently working on a Bitcoin to M-Pesa exchange in Kenya. In the hope of creating a more efficient remittance service first in Kenya and hopefully later in other countries.\nSo, what I hope to accomplish is I hope to bring an international business focus to the foundation. And I\u2019m already a bitcoin evangelist and talk about it a great deal to people and business investors I meet. And, obviously, if I were on the board I would do a great deal more than that.\nLTB:\u00a0Why do you want to serve on the Foundation Board?\nDGS:\u00a0Well I\u2019ve been interested in digital currencies since the mid-90s when I edited a financial times newsletter called the Virtual Finance Report. And I published many articles about the potential for digital currencies and attended the meetings of the international financial cryptography association, eventually becoming a director of that.\nIt happens to be one of my passions to see alternative currencies succeed. My particular interest in Bitcoin is that it is a bearer instrument. And I\u2019m interested in taking bearer instruments on to the, or like cash, on to the internet.\nI have the time, I\u2019ve got the interest, and I would hope I would be able to make a positive contribution.\nLTB:\u00a0What makes you qualified for the position?\nDGS:\u00a0I think that\u2019s for the members to decide, but I\u2019m [couldn\u2019t understand] from some of the others is I\u2019m not a technologist, I\u2019m not a coder or developer or a bitcoin miner. I\u2019m an entrepreneur, businessman, investor, experienced board member with a variety of organizations. Both charities, not for profit and commercial.\nAnd my focus is on really making things happen. I like to make things work. I\u2019ve been around the space, the payment space, as a journalist, entrepreneur, and businessman for quite a long time. So I hope my board and business experience would add to the perhaps more technical experience being offered by other members of the board.\nLTB:\u00a0Do you believe there is a right and wrong way to use a Bitcoin?\nDGS:\u00a0No. I mean, the whole attraction Bitcoin is that it\u2019s a bearer instrument and behaves like cash. I want to get away from some central authority deciding how someone should spend their money.\nI work in many countries in Africa and the Middle East and it\u2019s become a nightmare dealing with the paranoia of the banks and payment companies. The AML and KYC requirements on remittances impose billions of costs for no discernable benefit. And all of that compliance cost could be saved and a fraction could be spent on more targeted intelligence to greater effect.\nSo no. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s up for the payment system to judge the use of the payments. The world doesn\u2019t have the resources to vet every Somali in the US who wants to send $100 dollars to his mother back to his mother back home and the current process is killing that. So I\u2019d like to free up that whole process.\nLTB:\u00a0What are your views on Bitcoins software development?\nDGS:\u00a0That\u2019s a tricky one for me, because I\u2019m not a developer or coder. I think my understanding is that individuals propose or develop changes. And that the core developers have a fair bit of say in what is accepted, but ultimately the mining community decides in which direction the code goes.\nNow the mining seems to be becoming rather concentrated in a few mining pools. And I don\u2019t know how much of an issue that is, but, I mean, the ultimate test is going to be user acceptance. If Bitcoin doesn\u2019t gain market traction then another alt-currency will.\nMaybe you mean more about software development in terms of applications instead of the core code? That might be more meaningful to the foundation. If so I\u2019d certainly like to see there being a strong focus on the usability of Bitcoin applications. Simple secure software that can be understood and used by non-specialists.\nLTB:\u00a0Do you have plans to work with the Bitcoin Community, if so how will you deal with\u00a0the diversity of opinion that exists within that community?\nDGS:\u00a0One of my companies, Misoni, is actually, the holding company is actually Dutch registered in Amsterdam. The Dutch have this decision making model, I think it\u2019s called the\u00a0Polder Model, of endless discussions, iterative discussions to finally reach a consensus.\nYeah, it seems to work.\nI\u2019m quite used to dealing with teams, a diversity of opinion, discussion, and as a member of quite of few boards, one of my roles is to try to find common grounds between diverse opinions.\nLTB:\u00a0Should the Foundation hire a lobbyist? If yes, why and where should they lobby? If no, why isn\u2019t lobbying important?\nDGS:\u00a0I think yes, and probably in D.C. I think by necessity, the foundation is going to be US-centric, and may well over time spawn off shoots and affiliates in other countries. I\u2019m not entirely sure how far those discussions have gone.\nProbably D.C. Maybe California as well, I\u2019m not sure. But in terms of speaking to the regulators that\u2019s primarily going to be D.C.\nLTB:\u00a0If you had to change one thing about the Bitcoin Foundation, what would it be and why?\nDGS:\u00a0I don\u2019t have an answer for that. I think it\u2019s way too early for me to comment on that. It seems to be doing a good job of engaging with the public and with regulators. I would have to be much more involved in the day to day work to form a view as to whether anything needed changing.\nIf you have enjoyed this interview, you can find the other candidates interviews here:\nAaron LasherBen DavenportChristian KammlerDmitry (Rassah) MurashchikElizabeth PloshayJoerg PlatzerLuke-JrNilam DoctorNoah SilvermanRyan DemingTrace Mayer", "year": 2013, "month": 9, "day": 3}

For myself, it is the unifying reach Bitcoin has around the world and back. Who would have thought that Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019sinitial white paper from October 2008 would spark a revolution of unification, ingenuity and cross cultural, cross race, cross political, cross faith, and cross ideological lines. After first learning about Bitcoin I initially could not wrap my mind around the idea that I could send money from my cell phone to my relatives in Norway, friends in Washington, DC or my family in New Jersey with just the scan of a QR code. Bitcoin leads us to embrace a world of interconnectedness where we are prompted to and benefit much from learning from people around the world who may be different on paper from us but share a common desire for economic liberty, ingenuity and freedom of speech.\nWhen I began to research further, my eyes were opened to the opportunities Bitcoin provides all people. As an electronic cash system, no attention is paid to one\u2019s faith, race, and gender, as the only connection is one that all people can share, the Internet. As I learned more about just how prudent it would be to get involved in such a currency to promote peace and interconnectedness around the world, I was growing tired of the partisanship on Capitol Hill.\nBitcoin and the ideals behind the currency and community prompt individuals to work together and share ideas from one nation to another between one individual with another regardless of background. In a limited government, free market, liberty promoting community such as that of the Bitcoin ecosystem, much can be accomplished as no gender based, faith based, cultural based, or even socioeconomic based glasses need to be worn.\nIn addition to providing tremendous economic opportunities, Bitcoin provides a point of connection where two, three, or more can come together and share ideas of best practices having a common bond of wanting an expedient and efficient electronic cash system. Having worked now exclusively in the Bitcoin space for several months, I am amazed at the variety of individuals I have met from around the world of different educational backgrounds, political ideologies, nationalities and life goals. With the common point of interest in Bitcoin, we have been able to collaborate on projects and together forward the goals of limited government intervention in the economy, freedom of speech, individual rights and liberties, the cause of ingenuity. Most importantly, we have come together to work to preserve and protect the merits of Bitcoin and educate on why and how Bitcoin is one of the best unifiers one can find to bridge a gender, international, cultural, political, educational, career, socioeconomic, faith based, and even generational gap.\nI do not know about you, but I hope to continue to learn more from others in the Bitcoin space and I look forward to watching this community growth. On behalf of Bitcoin Magazine, I encourage you to continue to engage and get involved in the Bitcoin community. My one guarantee: be prepared to be challenged, grow and learn much in a short period of time. Why wait?!\n", "year": 2013, "month": 8, "day": 29}

Levine (Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin):\u00a0Please introduce yourself and give a brief overview of what you hope to accomplish with your candidacy.\nElizabeth Ploshay:\u00a0My name is\u00a0Elizabeth T. Ploshay\u00a0and I am running to represent you and the Bitcoin community on the Bitcoin Foundation board in the open individual seat. Having previously served as a scheduler and Middle Eastern policy assistant for a US member of Congress I am now privileged to work alongside the Bitcoin Magazine team as the Manager of Communications.\nWith a background in public policy and a keen desire to promote limited government and free market principles, I am fascinated by the multiple opportunities Bitcoin peer-to-peer currency has to offer.\nAs your representative on the Bitcoin Foundation board, I will strive to promote an organized decentralized approach of the Foundation towards Bitcoin. I plan to:\nIncrease international outreach.Work to bridge the gender gap.Work with the Bitcoin Foundation board members to ensure that the community is prepared for any government intervention in the Bitcoin space.Help transform the Bitcoin Foundation into more of an information aggregate system for individuals, businesses, and charitable organizations.Maintain a decentralized approach to development.Support and strengthen educational materials.Be mindful of the next generation of Bitcoin users.Strategize how to continue to increase the size of the Bitcoin community.\nAnd most importantly, I\u2019m willing [to] invest the time and talent that is needed to be available to the community and other board members. I plan on working to preserve and protect the principles of Bitcoin, which make this currency the success is today.\nLBT:\u00a0Why do you want to serve?\nEP:\u00a0As a member of Bitcoin Foundation and Manager of Communications for Bitcoin Magazine, I\u2019m running for the open individual seat on the Bitcoin Foundation Board to represent you and preserve and protect the merits and future of Bitcoin. Time is of essence and the Bitcoin Foundation needs a take-charge leader who is willing to put in long hours until the job is accomplished. And most importantly someone who has a solid plan to take not only the Bitcoin currency but the Bitcoin Foundation to the next level.\nThe Bitcoin currency brings together the best technological advancement, ingenuity, individual responsibility, and most importantly limited government principles. Since my first exposure to Bitcoin, I\u2019ve been fascinated and have wanted to do all I can to continue to bring the Bitcoin currency to a place of prominence, utility and long term success. It would be an honor to share my communications, political, lobbying, organizational skills, and passion for the bitcoin currency in service on the Bitcoin Foundation Board of Directors.\nLet\u2019s face it. Bitcoin is a phenomenal innovation as a digital decentralized crypto currency that can reach the ends of the world and back in seconds and has a potential to not just help people around the world, but rebrand money as we know it. For this reason, I am seeking your support to serve you on the Bitcoin Foundation Board to preserve and protect the founding principles of Bitcoin, which have made this phenomena the strongest digital currency and if not currency to date.\nLTB:\u00a0What makes you qualified for the position?\nEP:\u00a0\u00a0The Bitcoin Foundation has an opportunity to elect someone with not only experience in public policy, but also someone with first-hand lobbying experience. Having first lobbied a member of Congress at the end of my senior year in High School, I have an understanding stemming from experience of how to best communicate a message, and when needed, press for legislation to be passed into law.\nIn addition to serving in an advocacy role, I also have experience meeting with lobbyist[s] and \u00a0learning through observation best practices for clearly and concisely communicating a message.\nAs the only female candidate, a recent college graduate, former congressional staff member with a background in grassroots organization, public policy, and public relations, I plan on leading with a model of organized decentralization. As your representative on the Bitcoin Foundation Board I will strive to promote outreach to men and women within and outside of the Bitcoin community international growth and outreach of Bitcoin communities around the world and understanding of the non-partisan cross cultural and international characteristics of Bitcoin. The use of Bitcoin for charitable purposes a decentralized approach to development organization of Bitcoin related media and educational resources an outreach to the next generation of Bitcoin users.\nThe Bitcoin community is a force to be reckoned with, but must be organized and purposeful. Time is of essence and the Bitcoin Foundation needs someone with the energy perseverance and most importantly the know-how to provide the full picture of how Bitcoin is an asset to each policy maker in the US and around the world\nLTB:\u00a0Do you believe there is a right and a wrong way to use Bitcoin?\nEP:\u00a0Bitcoin represents economic and ideological opportunities for individuals around the world. \u00a0In terms of use, Bitcoin serves numerous purposes. While intended to be an electronic cash system, Bitcoin has far surpassed that and paved the way for economic advancement of individuals and businesses around the world. While Bitcoin can be used to make a financial transaction between any two individuals or parties with Internet connection it thus can be used to buy or sell a wide array of goods.\nThis question could be rephrased as, \u2018do you believe there is a right and a wrong way to use money?\u2019.\nMy response would certainly be, of course as money can be used for good or evil. In terms of specifics, Bitcoin can and already has been used in illicit transactions. Yet the majority of Bitcoin users do not intend to engage in illegal activity. With Bitcoin payment processing companies such as BitPay, Coinbase, and BIPS having thousands of law abiding merchants now \u00a0transacting in Bitcoin, it is clear that the main use of Bitcoin in the community is to buy and sell products already legal in the marketplace, but in a more efficient way. As a member of the Bitcoin Foundation Board, I would highlight the many benefits of Bitcoin use and specifically the value Bitcoin has to the non-profit realm. It is evident that Bitcoin is the optimal catalyst and vehicle for charitable contributions and already has accomplished much good to date.\nLTB:\u00a0What are your views on Bitcoin\u2019s software development?\nEP:\u00a0I support a decentralized approach to software development. To some, consolidating and controlling Bitcoin may appear to be an attractive option, but we must be cautious of any attempts to alter the distributed nature of Bitcoin and the Bitcoin-Qt open source project. With decentralization comes greater opportunity for the growth and development of ideas based on their merits and encourages ingenuity.\nThe Bitcoin related companies also hire developers to work on the core development of Bitcoin and many developers donate their valuable time effort and expertise.\nThis process protects the decentralized nature of Bitcoin and provides an opportunity for individuals and businesses within the Bitcoin community to positively influence the future of Bitcoin while maintaining a safeguard against changes that compromise the characteristics that make Bitcoin so valuable. It is constructive for businesses to give back to the community by hiring individuals to solely work on the Qt client.\nOpen source software is definitely vital to the preservation and strengthening of Bitcoin. With decentralization of the development community there is greater room and leverage for an increased number of individuals to enter for the community to contribute.\nThere is value in the marketplace of ideas as trial and error and diversity of thought inspires the development of the strongest wallets payment processors and software. There\u2019s definitely too much risk in entrusting all the development and protocol to a few. So we must continue our commitment to an open source idea that makes Bitcoin the resilient system it is today.\nLTB:\u00a0Should the Foundation hire a lobbyist? If yes, why and where should they lobby? If no, why isn\u2019t lobbying important?\nEP:\u00a0It is vital that the Bitcoin Foundation stay ahead of the game in advocating policy makers in Washington D.C. and around the world. It is crucial that all members of the Bitcoin community learn how to and in turn educate their policy makers. As the Bitcoin Foundation continues to expand the Foundation leadership should also to expand with the government relations team in the US and in key cities around the world. Each growing Bitcoin community should have at least 1 pinpoint individual who has knowledge of the inner workings of the government structure within that specific nation and municipality. Here in the United States, members of the Bitcoin Foundation have already stepped up to the plate to meet with policy makers in Washington, but we need a mobilization of the base of the Bitcoin community members to also follow suit.\nShould the Bitcoin Foundation have the budget to hire a full time lobbyist in the US and for targeted cities around the world such as Berlin, Buenos Aires, Vienna, Tel Aviv, and London, I stand in full support.\nHaving experience as a congressional staff member and lobbying experience as well, as your representative on the Bitcoin Foundation Board I will look forward to working with the members of the Bitcoin Foundation and community and a lobbying team to share my experience in educating members of congress and also best practices in lobbying in D.C. and around the world.\nLBT:\u00a0If you had to change one thing about the Bitcoin Foundation, what would it be and why?\nEP:\u00a0The Bitcoin Foundation can increase outreach and focus on broadening the Bitcoin the Bitcoin community membership base. The Bitcoin community is only as strong as its leadership and membership base. Should I have the privilege of serving on the BItcoin Foundation Board, I would work to increase the diversity of the Bitcoin community.\nTo date, the Bitcoin community is lacking strong support and involvement from half of the global population: women. After first learning about Bitcoin, and now investing my entire career and work to promote the Bitcoin currency, I see a clear need for a shift in mindset of the Bitcoin community to do a better job of sharing the value of Bitcoin to all people, men and women.\nWith thousands of merchants and small businesses now embracing and accepting, there\u2019s a need for men and women to learn how applicable Bitcoin is to everyday life. As one of the handfuls of females currently working to promote Bitcoin, I hope to foster a greater understanding and embrace of Bitcoin to an extent that crosses geographic and gender based \u00a0boundaries. The Bitcoin Foundation must also be intentional about international outreach and fostering the growth of Bitcoin communities and meetup groups around the world. In order to succeed, Bitcoin must continue to grow in utility around the world. Additionally, the Foundation should also work to reach out to the next generation of Bitcoin users.\nLBT:\u00a0Do you have plans to work with the Bitcoin community? If so, how will you deal with the diversity of opinion?\nEP:\u00a0I definitely plan on working with and continuing to get involved with the Bitcoin community regardless of the election results. I plan on promoting a model of organized decentralization to encourage grassroots activism within the community and fostering an open marketplace of ideas.\nDiversity of opinion in the Bitcoin community is key, as member of the Bitcoin community serves a unique role and a direct voice and part to play in keeping the Bitcoin currency on a pathway to success growth, value, and utility on a global reach.\nThe Bitcoin Foundation has an opportunity to foster leadership on a local level and grassroots activism to promote the spread and utility of Bitcoin. As a member of the Bitcoin Foundation board, I would hope to not only work to improve our layout of resources for leaders within the Bitcoin community to expand the utility and reach of Bitcoin, but I would also take the initiative to encourage individuals to step up into leadership roles within the community.\nIn order maintain a decentralized approach in moving forward the Bitcoin currency, the Bitcoin Foundation must mobilize leaders within the community in all sectors. While encouraging individuals to take responsibility and expand their outreach efforts to expand the size and scope of Bitcoin, the Bitcoin Foundation will strengthen the decentralized nature in an organized fashion.\nIf you have enjoyed this interview, you can find the other candidates interviews here:\nAaron LasherBen DavenportChristian KammlerDmitry (Rassah) MurashchikDuncan Goldie-ScotJoerg PlatzerLuke-JrNilam DoctorNoah SilvermanRyan DemingTrace Mayer", "year": 2013, "month": 9, "day": 3}

Levine (Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin):\u00a0Please introduce yourself and give a brief overview of what you hope to accomplish with your candidacy.\nNilam Doctor:\u00a0I am Nilam Doctor from India. And also [couldn\u2019t understand] Mauritius.\nI\u2019m a lifetime member of the Bitcoin Foundation, an expert in IT security, and have been a strategic advisor to organizations with regard to IT technology and education.\nI\u2019m currently developing a couple of Bitcoin projects with missions to make the [couldn\u2019t understand] currency grow into a viable mainstream currency.\nFirst, I\u2019m developing DreamCoins a local digital currency headquartered in Mauritius. Second is a virtual currency exchange established only for the UK right now. I\u2019m a lead developer for this exchange. We have full AML and KYC standards for customers of the UK. We will soon be expanding within Indian and African subcontinent regions.\nLTB:\u00a0Why do you want to serve on the Foundation Board?\nND:\u00a0In December 2012, I studied the [Bitcoin] protocol, and immediately joined the Foundation as a life member. I conducted seminars in a few cities in India. Based on the response from India, I decided to attend the [Bitcoin 2013] conference in San Jose, USA.\nWhile interacting with the leading developers and the director of the Foundation, I felt the need to bring developing countries, especially from Latin America, Asia, and Africa, in the mainstream for Bitcoin usage.\nI also propose that the next global conference for Bitcoin to be held in a developing nation like India or Mauritius.\nMy value based vision is to change Bitcoin from a one-size-fits-all concept to a user customization thus making it more popular, especially among the youth, for daily transactions.\nLTB:\u00a0What makes you qualified for the position?\nND:\u00a0My passion for Bitcoin is the single most [valuable] asset that I think qualifies me. Apart from that I have 25 plus years of experience in IT related consulting projects including [couldn\u2019t understand]. I have positioned myself as an innovative leader to generate new ideas and technologies for the masses.\nI want to promote Bitcoin for the society with the help of governance and making everyone understand that if we move from a fiat to a virtual currency we make the planet more green, we save paper, and metal.\nThus one of my aims, is to bring innovations in the banking customer relation architecture and in governments [couldn\u2019t understand]. Just for an example, government water, electricity, roads, and communication. With taxes collected from people and governments and society [couldn\u2019t understand].\nI think Bitcoin has a huge potential to liberate and benefit existing economic systems. Not only in a nation, but globally.\nLTB:\u00a0Do you believe there is a right and wrong way to use a Bitcoin?\nND:\u00a0Yes. As is true with all exchangeable commodities, there is a right way and a wrong way to use Bitcoins. I think one of the groundbreaking innovations I want to introduce, is to use Bitcoins for daily transactions for buying and selling goods and commodities.\nOn an average we undertake 10 transactions a day for our daily requirements. These transactions should never be taxed or have transaction fees. Each person always uses his cash and uses them .\nAt the same time, when we buy an asset like a car or a house, we know that this money is coming from a loan or sources of income and has to be taxed for the society to function.\nI think this is the right way for using a virtual currency like Bitcoin. There is no wrong way to use it. One can use it with innovation and it will turn out to be the right way in the future.\nLTB:\u00a0What are your views on Bitcoins software development?\nND:\u00a0The process of software development, which was started by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 and is still maintained by Gavin, has met all the standards of a good protocol increasing its popularity and usage among 20 million people.\nThere is a need to make the software development better and faster. It is important to understand the needs of the people across different regions and sections of the society and the purpose of changes in compliance at the board.\nFinally, as [the] internet protocol has modified itself to suit the needs and requirements of niche users, I assume that the bitcoin protocol has to be customized suiting emerging market needs rather than one size fits all.\nLTB:\u00a0Do you have plans to work with the Bitcoin Community, if so how will you deal with the diversity of opinion?\nND:\u00a0Bitcoin community comprises of intellectuals who want to change the way one operationalizes virtual currency markets.\nThe community is beaming with new ideas and innovations and there is [a] need to streamline the positive energy into executable and doable projects.\nIdeas from the community have always helped the development of innovations. Being analytical and understand[ing] a change is vital. A change is a must in an emerging virtual currency environment. Diversity is necessary, which leads the growth from within.\nI moved from India to Mauritius to make a change. I proposed to bring Bitcoin into [the] mainstream by making a digital, local, national, and a global currency.\nIt is possible, I believe. The time is right [and in] Bitcoin\u2019s favor.\nLTB:\u00a0Should the Foundation hire a lobbyist? If yes, why and where should they lobby?\nND:\u00a0Of course, a big yes. The Foundation should hire a lobbyist. I think the lobbyist should be based in any US city. As major users [couldn\u2019t understand] in a US city. The person should be someone who has experience to bring about change at major policy implications affecting Bitcoins.\nHe or she should be a bridge a between those promoting a change in the economy and the policy legislature regulating economies. The person should have a high level access to influential decision makers. He or she should provide an insight to the problems faced and solutions which are necessary for change.\nHistorically, the transition of economic currency from a barter system to a shell, paper, and metal currency to a plastic currency economy. Now is the time to move from this to a virtual digital world of Bitcoin currency.\nLTB:\u00a0If you had to change one thing about the Bitcoin Foundation, what would it be and why?\nND:\u00a0The main important thing to change in the Foundation is the understanding that Bitcoin is not the final solution to the changing virtual economy. It is a beginning to [a] total new world area in the ways we transact.\nIn the coming years, [the] bitcoin protocol will change a lot. And the Foundation should be ready to adopt these changes and also empower everyone.\nI see soon, as a 4 year old child is exploring fire, so is Bitcoin. Let it explore all the avenues available everywhere.\nEach country we have that holds local digital virtual currency backed up by Bitcoin as a standard international transactable currency in [the] future.\nIf you have enjoyed this interview, you can find the other candidates interviews here:\n\nAaron LasherBen DavenportChristian KammlerDmitry (Rassah) MurashchikDuncan Goldie-ScotElizabeth PloshayJoerg PlatzerLuke-JrNoah SilvermanRyan DemingTrace Mayer\n", "year": 2013, "month": 9, "day": 3}

Santori explained, \u201cOur message was straightforward: It is critical that the industry and the regulators work together to create a safe and sane regulatory environment for Bitcoin businesses in the United States,\u201d and proceeded to highlight that the Foundation representatives took some tough questions but were pleased that a dialogue was established.\nMonday\u2019s meeting with regulators was spearheaded by an invitation to a private conference held by FinCEN in Washington, D.C.

Levine (Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin):\u00a0Please introduce yourself and give \u00a0a brief overview of what you hope to accomplish with your candidacy.\nLuke Dashjr:\u00a0My name is Luke Dashjr, and I hope to improve openness within the Foundation, as well as discourage it from taking direct control over Bitcoin resources, but rather work by supporting others who are really responsible for making Bitcoin successful.\nLTB:\u00a0Why do you want to serve on the Foundation Board?\nLD:\u00a0I think that with\u00a0my technical background\u00a0and exposure to a wide variety of Bitcoin communities, this will be the best way I can help Bitcoin even further along.\n\nLTB:\u00a0What makes you qualified for the position?\nLD:\u00a0In the past three years, I have worked directly on many different parts of the Bitcoin project, including Bitcoin-Qt, and am familiar with the intimate details of the core protocols. Because of this, I can offer the community down-to-earth help at improving Bitcoin education and use.\nLTB:\u00a0Do you believe there is a right and wrong way to use a Bitcoin?\nLD:\u00a0This is a complicated topic, and I probably don\u2019t have time in this interview to elaborate on it as much as it deserves. There are definitely some unethical possible uses of Bitcoin: an example might be forcing every Bitcoin user to store your own personal backups by encoding it into the UTXO database, thus taking away everyone\u2019s choice; we\u2019ve all agreed to store financial data, but not necessarily other stuff. It\u2019s quite possible to accomplish the same goals with\u00a0merged mining, in a way that such data is stored only by users who have made a free decision to participate in it.\n\nLTB:\u00a0What are your views on Bitcoins software development?\nLD:\u00a0There\u2019s a lot of diversity which is good but at the same time, not enough diversity in full node implementations where it\u2019s really needed the most to make Bitcoin truly decentralized.\nLTB:\u00a0Do you have plans to work with the Bitcoin Community, if so how will you deal with the diversity of opinions contained therein?\nLD:\u00a0I regularly hang out in many Bitcoin communities already, including 3 forums, over 15 active IRC channels, and 3 email discussion groups. I\u2019m always open to joining other communities and discussions where my participation is desired.\nLTB:\u00a0Should the Foundation hire a lobbyist?

Levine (Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin):\u00a0Please introduce yourself and give a brief overview of what you hope to accomplish with your candidacy.\nAaron Lasher:\u00a0My name is Aaron Lasher and I would be the most staunchly negative member on the board, possibly in the entire Bitcoin Foundation when it comes to financial regulations. I understand this is a bit of a strong standpoint. So, for that reason alone I don\u2019t necessarily expect this of the Bitcoin community. But I think it\u2019s important for them to have that option. You know, if they want someone who is always going to be the grump in the room who says, \u2018No. We should not do this. We should resist these incremental regulatory pressures and find other ways to make Bitcoin flourish.\u2019, then I\u2019m probably your guy.\nLTB:\u00a0Why do you want to serve on the Bitcoin Foundation Board?\nAL:\u00a0Although there\u2019s a healthy amount of skepticism in the Bitcoin community regarding financial regulation, I\u2019ve noticed that whenever FINCEN or another oversight committee in another country makes a statement about how they would deal with virtual currencies, that there follows a fair amount of celebration on behalf of the Bitcoin users. I believe this optimism is misplaced.\nI understand that Bitcoin entrepreneurs, who build the backbone of the Bitcoin community, have to deal with regulators by nature of the fact that they fall under the purview of multiple regulatory bodies. And they must seek clarity to assess the risk of whether they need to comply with AML laws or register as a money transmitter or money services business. So I don\u2019t blame them for seeking clarification, but for the average user, I would estimate that over 90% of regulatory clarification will imply a move in the wrong direction.\nSo by design, regulations are incremental and vague. They result in an environment where your success rests not on breaking or following all of the regulations to the \u2018T\u2019, which is also technically impossible, but rather your political influence. Like a pest resistance crop, Bitcoin has regulation resistance built in. Whether we embrace or resist it, I think that battle lines will have to be drawn at some point.\nLTB:\u00a0What makes you qualified for the position?\nAL:\u00a0Aside from being a long/medium term Bitcoin user and enthusiast, I believe there are three things that qualify me for the position. Number one. In 2005, I co-founded an educational non-profit generating curricular content for underfunded public schools in Chicago and New York cities. We connect adventurers and their stories in order to inspire them to learn more about the world in an engaging way.\nThe fundraising process was something of a baptism of fire. And it taught me just how difficult it is to raise money for a cause. So I learned how to become an advocate. How to bring people and persuade them of a vision. I think advocacy is an essential trait for this position.\nNumber two. I\u2019m a licensed sea captain. And I know how to work with teams in close quarters making difficult decisions. I can quickly generate consensus among people and provide solutions to problems, but I also know when it is time to step down.\nThree. Although I\u2019m American, I grew up in Europe, and I\u2019ve also visited over 70 countries. As a result, I\u2019m pretty good at connecting with the international community on a personal level.\nLTB:\u00a0Do you believe there is a right and wrong way to use a Bitcoin?\nAL:\u00a0Yes, but you would first have to engage in a discussion on moral philosophy. \u00a0Bitcoin is a tool, and like other tools it can be used for a variety of purposes. \u00a0A knife can be used to prepare dinner or stab somebody. Is stabbing somebody bad? \u00a0Typically, most people would agree that it is. \u00a0But what if the victim was also an armed intruder? \u00a0There\u2019s a grey area that can only be resolved with more in-depth analysis.\nHowever, that said, I think that all forms of money are pretty neutral when you compare them to other tools. I\u2019m strongly in favor of people deciding for themselves of how to spend their money in almost every situation.\nLTB:\u00a0What are your views on Bitcoins software development?\nAL:\u00a0It\u2019s an absolute miracle that there are so many incredible coders out there. And I believe that this in itself is enough to keep the Bitcoin protocol moving forward safely, effectively, and honestly. However, centralization isn\u2019t a bad thing in and of itself. Perhaps centralized authority is, but not centralized expertise and organization.\nFor instance, I was totally inspired with how quickly that the last unexpected hard fork was resolved. It seems now, that we have just the right balance of a semi-official bitcoin qt client with a dozen or so clients waiting in the wings looking to improve the code and collaborate with one another filling different niches. The incentives, I think, are just really well aligned for everyone to cooperate and it results in a collegial atmosphere.\nLTB:\u00a0Do you have plans to work with the Bitcoin Community? If so, how will you deal with the diversity of opinion?\nAL:\u00a0The most exciting thing about the future that I foresee is a massive flight from fiat currency into hard currencies, including Bitcoin. I don\u2019t know precisely what it would take, whether fiat currencies need to get bad enough, or bitcoin becomes trusted enough, but I do think that it will happen. And when it does, we\u2019re going to have to really open the doors wide to let everybody in.\nThat said, there are four broad groups for which I would like to create unique outreach programs.\n1) People who don\u2019t understand the current monetary system.\nThey need to be informed about why there are bank bail outs, where inflation comes from.\n2) People who understand the current system, but are in favor of it.\nThey need to be persuaded that everyone is better off without central banking.\n3) People with liberal progressive or statist political views (those that self-identify with those categories).\nMany of these individuals are already strong members of the Bitcoin community, but they get turned off by libertarian crazies like me. Fortunately, there\u2019s a lot of common ground that we can find and, hopefully, agree upon.\n4) People in emerging economies who do not have access to typical financial services.\nFor these I would imagine private non-profits coordinating with the Bitcoin Foundation can do a lot to simply get Bitcoins into these communities.\nLTB:\u00a0Should the Foundation hire a lobbyist? If yes, why and where should they lobby? \u00a0If no, why isn\u2019t lobbying important?\nAL:\u00a0Sure, why not? Everyone else seems to have one. Besides, we wouldn\u2019t be looking for handouts or special treatment. Mostly just to be left alone and recognized as non-criminal. I do think a lobbyist on the payroll could be beneficial.\nLTB:\u00a0If you had to change one thing about the Bitcoin Foundation, what would it be and why?\nAL:\u00a0I recognize that the Bitcoin Foundation is just a voluntary group made up of voluntary individuals. So, I wouldn\u2019t be so rude as to imply that it needs to be doing anything differently.\nBut, if elected, I would be excited to spearhead the following 3 initiatives:\n1) Full-blown contingency disaster plan.\nCovering as many potential technical or geo-political developments as possible. \u00a0Along with what steps should be taken to mitigate those eventualities.\n2) More national and international Bitcoin Foundation member appearances on broadcast networks.\nHelping to legitimize the community in the eyes of future adopters.\n3) Comprehensive Bitcoin PR campaign.\nTaking charge of the public message, spreading the word on the benefits of personal financial freedom, and dismissing the Bitcoiners-as-criminals smear campaign.\nIf you have enjoyed this interview, you can find the other candidates interviews here:\nBen DavenportChristian KammlerDmitry (Rassah) MurashchikDuncan Goldie-ScotElizabeth PloshayJoerg PlatzerLuke-JrNilam DoctorNoah SilvermanRyan DemingTrace Mayer", "year": 2013, "month": 9, "day": 3}

I\u2019m a data scientist and a dot com entrepreneur. I see great potential in the future of Bitcoin and look forward to representing the community.\nLTB: Why do you want to serve on the Foundation Board?\nNS: I\u2019m very excited about the future of Bitcoin and all of the great things it brings. And I believe my skill set would contribute significantly to the growth and stability of the community.\nLTB: What makes you qualified for this position?\nNS: I started developing internet companies and working with technologies back in the mid 90s. So, I\u2019m intimately familiar with the technical aspects. After that, I received a masters degree in statistics with a focus on data science, and I\u2019m one paper short of a Ph.D. in the same subject.\nAnd I think the Foundation has people great with policy, but I don\u2019t think we have anybody who\u2019s a real data scientist who\u2019s good with data. And data is a key component of the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nLTB: Do you believe there is a right and wrong way to use a Bitcoin?\nNS: I take the stance that Bitcoin is like any other currency. So it\u2019s the same question, \u201cIs there a right way or wrong way to use a $100 bill?\u201d\nAnd the answer depends on the legal jurisdiction you\u2019re in. It would be wrong to buy something illegal with it, it would be right to use it for anything else.\nLTB: What are your views on Bitcoins software development?\nNS: I love that Bitcoin software is developed as an open source project. It gives the entire community a very nice sense of security that there are no hidden surprises in there. And I hope that it continues to grow as an open source project.\nLTB: Do you have plans to work with the Bitcoin Community, if so how will you deal with the diversity of opinion contained therein?\nNS: Yes, I do plan to work with the Bitcoin community regardless of whether I wind up on the board or not. I have a blog that I started and I actually spoke at the Bitcoin 2013 conference.\nThere will always be diversity of opinion about anything especially something as sensitive as a currency. And I think the important part is to help the community reach rational balanced decisions, that serve the majority of the users. But also take a realistic view of the legal and regulatory environment that we live in.\nLTB: Should the Foundation hire a lobbyist? If yes, why and where should they lobby?\nNS: Lobbyists are, I think, a necessary evil. I do like the idea of having somebody represent us in Washington D.C. For the simple fact that US government regulatory policy tends to have a massive impact on the global financial markets. And, I think, having a voice for the Foundation to dispel myth and dispel fear and dispel uncertainty, and, sort of, make sure the truth is out there in front of legislators, I think is important.\nLTB: If you had to change one thing about the Bitcoin Foundation, what would it be and why?\nNS: I like the Foundation. I think it\u2019s a good thing. In fact, my only real issue is that not enough people participate. Really anybody with any interest in Bitcoin of any kind, should be involved in the Foundation. Should participate in the forums. Should at least spend the very small amount of money to be a member for a year.\nAnd I\u2019m not [saying] that to sound self serving for the election, but I really believe the Foundation is one of the best paths to helping Bitcoin further establish legitimacy.\nIf you have enjoyed this interview, you can find the other candidates interviews here:\nAaron LasherBen DavenportChristian KammlerDmitry (Rassah) MurashchikDuncan Goldie-ScotElizabeth PloshayJoerg PlatzerLuke-JrNilam DoctorRyan DemingTrace Mayer\n", "year": 2013, "month": 9, "day": 3}
{"title": "Introducing the Exchanges: Coinbase (Part 2)", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/introducing-exchanges-coinbase-part-2/", "birthday": "Sep 3, 2013  11:37 AM EST", "date": "2013-09-03 16:37:00", "content": "See also the\u00a0first part\u00a0of this series, and our previous entry on\u00a0BitStamp\nOver the past ten months, Coinbase has become well known in the United States for being one of the easiest-to-use Bitcoin exchanges out there. Using Coinbase, anyone with a bank account in the US can quickly fill in a form to have their bank account verified, and then buy and sell bitcoins directly from their bank account with a few clicks of a mouse. What many people do not realize, however, is that this service is only one of Coinbase\u2019s many offerings. Even before the buy and sell Bitcoin service existed, the company had its own set of\u00a0merchant tools\u00a0and Bitcoin wallet, and once the buy and sell Bitcoin service was introduced the two could be combined together into a complete, BitPay-like merchant package with which any merchant can accept bitcoins and have them immediately converted into USD and delivered to their bank account, all at a 1% fee. Adoption has been slow; Coinbase has nothing close to the roughly ten thousand merchants boasted by BitPay, but the company has had a number of successes. In February 2013,\u00a0Reddit\u00a0started accepting Bitcoin through Coinbase, followed by\u00a0OkCupid\u00a0and the\u00a0Humble Bundle\u00a0in April and, more recently,\u00a0Khan Academy, arguably the original precursor to the \u201cmassive open online courses\u201d seen on websites like\u00a0Coursera\u00a0today.\nThe Wallet\nOne of Coinbase\u2019s most basic offerings is the wallet. Unlike other Bitcoin wallets, which try to store the user\u2019s private keys locally, hopefully encrypted with a password, Coinbase\u2019s wallet more closely resembles a centralized \u201cbank account\u201d setup than anything else. The users\u2019 bitcoins are managed by Coinbase itself, and the company takes care to use state-of-the-art practices in wallet security and cold storage to keep the funds safe. Many Bitcoin users are adamantly against such a security model, preferring to hold their private keys to themselves, but Armstrong believes that many users, who are not as comfortable with managing their own computer security, would prefer it. Given the\u00a0myriad ways\u00a0in which Bitcoin users have had their private keys leaked in the past, there is indeed a strong case for Coinbase\u2019s solution \u2013 although a combined approach based on\u00a0multisignature transactions\u00a0would arguably be even better.\nBut the centralized wallet also offers other advantages. First of all, Coinbase-to-Coinbase transfers are confirmed instantly, as when Coinbase controls both the start and the endpoint there is no need for an actual Bitcoin transaction to happen at all. Second, the system is microtransaction-friendly, allowing people (or, likely, automated bots) the ability to transfer pennies at a time without paying any miner fees. Coinbase is already working with\u00a0BitWall, a startup that allows content creators to charge users to access their website, as the first practical application of its microtransaction system. Finally, most recently of all, Coinbase added a \u201crecurring payments\u201d feature where users can opt to have a certain amount of money automatically transferred from their accounts to a merchant every month, the obvious use case being subscription services like web hosting. This feature was in fact essential to getting Khan Academy on board; Brian Armstrong says: \u201cthey get a lot of recurring donations. People might donate once, but the default option is recurring donations at $10 per month.\u201d\nAutomatic recurring billing is somewhat controversial; the adult industry, for example, relies on people signing up for monthly subscription services and then forgetting about them for the bulk of its profits, and many other companies try to get people to sign up with their credit card for a \u201cfree trial\u201d, with a clause hidden in the terms of service saying that they will charge $95 per month unless the user cancels the trial manually. As a result, some consumer protection advocates have seized upon Bitcoin\u2019s lack of automatic recurring payment feature as an improvement over the current system, and are thus dead set against any attempts to change this (lack of) functionality. Armstrong, however, argues that users find recurring billing systems to be highly convenient, and plenty of legitimate businesses can benefit from it; charities, virtual private networks and web hosting services, all favorites of the Bitcoin community, will become much more convenient when users no longer need to manually pay a bill every month. Furthermore, Coinbase\u2019s approach, while not as \u201cpure\u201d as Bitcoin itself in requiring the user to manually enter each individual payment, is still far better than the credit card system. \u201cThe upside is that the merchant can\u2019t initiate a transaction by themselves, the merchant can\u2019t change the amount, and you can revoke it, just like you can revoke access to applications with Facebook,\u201d Armstrong explains. \u201cWhat we try to do is the best of both worlds.\u201d\nThe other major criticism is that Coinbase\u2019s protocols are proprietary, and people using other wallets have no way to interact with them. This, Armstrong acknowledges, is a weakness, but he argues that it is currently the only way for things to work. He likens the relationship between Coinbase and Bitcoin to that between Gmail and SMTP. \u201cEmail tends to get into a few centralized providers,\u201d Armstrong argues; \u201cSMTP provides a base level of functionality, but services like Gmail add features on top. But the upside is that there are low switching costs. You can switch from Gmail to Outlook, and you can export your email. If we ever do something to lose people\u2019s trust, your Bitcoin will work on any other email.\u201d Of course, switching costs still exist; if, in some far future Bitcoin economy, recurring billing services like Coinbase become mainstream, then merchants would be more willing to create subscription services , and the average user might end up saddled with dozens of subscription services, which would be nearly impossible to keep paying without a third-party provider, and would be a considerable expense to switch over if Coinbase decides not to include any kind of \u201cexport\u201d feature. However, the benefit of Coinbase is that it does not need to be used as one\u2019s main wallet; rather, it can simply be used as a top-up card, with the user only adding a few hundred dollars to one\u2019s Coinbase account at a time to pay recurring subscriptions as needed. If Coinbase does something to lose people\u2019s trust, the theory is, people will be able to switch over slowly, one subscription at a time. Hopefully, innovations in the public Bitcoin protocol, like the recent\u00a0payment protocol, together with improved wallet software will make it possible to have some of this functionality without relying on centralized providers at all; for now, however, Coinbase has the chance to fill a much-needed void.\n\n\n\nBells and Whistles\nAnother feature that Coinbase recently implemented is the SMS wallet, which allows users to perform most common actions, including buying bitcoins, selling bitcoins, sending bitcoins to another phone number, email address or Bitcoin address and generating a QR code to receive money, all through cell phone text messages. Currently the\u00a0wallet still requires a computer (or smartphone) with internet access to sign up for, but soon Coinbase will add a feature that allows users to sign up using their phones alone. \u201cSo you can send bitcoins to a phone number of someone who does not yet have a Coinbase account. They will receive an SMS to let them know how to create a Coinbase account, set up an SMS pin, and accept those bitcoins,\u201d Charlie Lee, the Coinbase developer who created the wallet, explains. Smartphone wallets for Bitcoin have been around for a long time, but the fact is that even now very many people still have old-fashioned \u201cdump phones\u201d (also known as \u201cfeature phones\u201d) that cannot easily download and run arbitrary applications. \u201cIn the US, it\u2019s only 45% of the population that have smartphones,\u201d Armstrong says, \u201cand in India it\u2019s 5%.\u201d It is important to note that Coinbase\u2019s SMS wallet currently does not work in India; at this point, it only supports the United States, but, Lee writes, \u201cWe will be launching support for UK and Canada real soon and we will work on supporting as many countries as we can.\u201d Coinbase\u2019s SMS wallet is currently the only service that allows users in any country to do everything they need to do with Bitcoin with nothing more than a text message interface; the closest alternatives are the Bitcoin sending service\u00a0Coinapult\u00a0and the yet-to-be-released SMS wallet\u00a0Kipochi. Extremely basic phones, with no internet access, may not be able to read QR codes, but even they can use all of the wallet\u2019s other features like sending and receiving bitcoins. Furthermore, as a replacement for QR codes, Lee recently added support for\u00a0firstbits, which allows users to type in the first few characters of an address and get the rest of the address by querying the blockchain.\nWith the SMS wallet, security is a major concern; SMS messages are known for being\u00a0easy to spoof, so a phone number by itself does not carry any significant level of security against all but the most clueless attackers. To alleviate this concern, the wallet allows users to set up a PIN which they will be required to enter to make any actions that affect one\u2019s balance (eg. sending money), although getting one\u2019s balance and generating QR codes remains password-free. The service also has a voice call feature integrated. Charlie Lee writes: \u201cWe do realize that SMS is easy to spoof, so that\u2019s why we require the voice call and PIN verification before you can send, buy, and sell. The PIN verification makes it 2-factor since you would need something you have (your SMS-enabled phone) and something you know (your PIN) in order to send your coins. The attacker would need to know your PIN, spoof your SMS, and intercept the voice call from us in order to steal your coins.\u201d Currently, the voice call is simply another way to enter one\u2019s PIN (namely, by speaking it rather than sending it in a message), but in theory Coinbase could add a layer of voice recognition to the authentication process if it proves to be useful or necessary.\nMerchant Tools\nTogether with the wallet, of course, Coinbase has its impressive set of merchant tools. The company now\u00a0offers\u00a0payment buttons, BitPay-style payment forms, email invoices, custom shopping cart integration, and, just like BitPay and BIPS, the ability for merchants to have their earnings immediately converted to US dollars as soon as they receive them. To attract more merchants, Coinbase recently added a new promotional offer: every business gets its first $1 million in transaction volume converted to fiat for free. After that, the feature will remain with a 1% fee, or merchants will be able to continue using Coinbase without any fees at all if they are willing to keep their revenue in bitcoins.\nThe main advantage of Coinbase over BitPay is that the tools are more heavily geared toward casual users. BitPay requires merchants to go through a manual approval process in order to use their service, which often takes up to two days. With Coinbase, as Armstrong describes it, \u201ceveryone is innocent until proven guilty. Anyone can make a payment button. We have review processes for compliance reasons, and if people are selling drugs then we do take it down, so we \u2018trust but verify'\u201d. However, at this point, Coinbase does little to advertise its tools; most of the merchants signing up with Coinbase are \u201cinbound interest\u201d, even among the established Silicon Valley businesses that have gathered the merchant tools some publicity. \u201cWe\u2019re not really a sales company,\u201d Armstrong says. Compared to BitPay\u2019s active marketing, affiliate revenue sharing programs and CEO Tony Gallippi\u2019s frequent presentations at payment conferences, the quiet strategy has not really been successful. \u201cMany people don\u2019t even realize we have merchant tools,\u201d Armstrong laments. However, this is slowly changing. Armstrong is looking to hire someone to focus on sales at the moment, and at the end of August the company made its first major \u201cpartnership\u201d\u00a0deal with eGifter, allowing anyone to buy digital gift cards for 100 major brands, including Barnes and Noble, GAP and Home Depot, with bitcoins \u2013 less impressive than BitPay\u2019s\u00a0deal with Gyft, but a solid start nonetheless. With more active initiatives like these, hopefully Coinbase will become a much more powerful force in the US market in the years to come.", "year": 2013, "month": 9, "day": 3}

Levine (Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin): Please introduce yourself and give a brief overview of what you hope to accomplish with your candidacy.\nTrace Mayer: I\u2019m Trace Mayer. I\u2019ve been involved with Bitcoin for a long time. Actually, Jon Matonis and I started our Bitcoin blogs within about a week of each other. We\u2019ve been major thought leaders together in this new space. I\u2019ve written a Bitcoin beginners guide, authored a lot of the Bitcoin FAQ.\nI\u2019ve had several national level media appearances already. So you can review and [look at] how I perform there. Whether it\u2019s Fox Business, Colbert Report, BBC News Night with Jeremy Paxman, and plenty of others.\nI\u2019ve also been invited to speak on Bitcoin. This is mainly because I have a background in accounting and also in law. So I\u2019ve been invited to present on Bitcoin to the Federal Reserve, Bundesbank Bank, major banks.\nI presented in conjunction with regulators and law enforcement whether it\u2019s IRS, FBI, etcetera.\nAnd I\u2019m on the editorial board of the Bitcoin Magazine. I\u2019m a seed round investor in BitPay, and also lead investor on a deal where he\nwhich I want to see just general increase in the level and security and professionalism of everything in the Bitcoin community. That\u2019s what I hope to accomplish with my candidacy.\nLTB: Why do you want to serve on the Foundation Board?\nTM: The main reason I would want to serve on the Bitcoin Foundation Board is because I really feel an affinity for the community. In a lot of cases, I\u2019ve either directly or indirectly influenced a wide variety of the people who are already here.\nI\u2019ve taught their bloggers that they read or listen to how to use Bitcoin. I\u2019ve done personal tutorials on people who bought Bitcoin; showed them how to use it etcetera. I\u2019ve funded major service providers like BitPay. And have worked with other startups and other entrepreneurs and looked at funding them. The deal has to be right, of course.\nAnd so, I want to see this community continue to grow. I want to continue to see Bitcoin fulfill its mission as an instrument of storing value that has no counter-party risks, no third parties, no intermediaries. And allows you to send money to anyone anywhere at any time with little or no fees.\nI want to see it move the human race forward, because money and currency is the most complicated good. And it takes somebody special to be able to understand it and how it applies.\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been writing about it for a long time and influencing a lot of people about it.\nLTB: What makes you qualified for the position?\nTM: Bitcoin is an opensource project. To be honest, I think everyone is qualified. Now that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that some people aren\u2019t qualified more than other people. And so, in that sense, anyone that wants to get involved in Bitcoin, just start doing something. Hopefully you can do something that is productive and useful and the market finds it such and rewards you with profit. What makes me perhaps more qualified than others for a board level position?\nWell I\u2019ve influenced a lot of the people in Bitcoin land as a thought leader. A lot of people wouldn\u2019t necessarily be in Bitcoin if it weren\u2019t for the efforts of us early thought leaders who were willing to stick our neck out there and take the risk to our reputation, etcetera, by talking about it. I\u2019ve got very thick skin in that regard and I\u2019ve got a solid understanding of what\u2019s going on with Bitcoin from the legal to the financial to the economic to the technical. All aspects of it. Some areas better than others, but a good overall understanding. And I think I can be very helpful on the board in that regard.\nLTB: Do you believe there is a right and wrong way to use a Bitcoin?\nTM: When it comes to whether there is a right or wrong way to use Bitcoin, I think it comes back to what\u2019s called the non-aggression axiom. That\u2019s that we shouldn\u2019t use violence or intimidation against innocent people or their legitimately acquired property. And so, I think, a right way to use Bitcoin is using it in a way that\u2019s in harmony with that axiom. And a wrong way would be using it in a way that\u2019s not in harmony with that axiom.\nI don\u2019t necessarily think that just because something is legal or illegal that it\u2019s moral or that it passes that non-aggression axiom.\nAnd with Bitcoin being a huge worldwide technological project and with laws and regulations constantly changing all over the world, I think, if we bring it back to that axiom and we use Bitcoin in that way, that\u2019s a right way to use it. And a wrong way would be where we\u2019re violating that axiom.\nLTB: What are your views on Bitcoin\u2019s software development?\nTM: My views on Bitcoin software development; I think that we have a lot of people who have a lot of vested interests: financial, economic, ideological, political, etcetera. And Bitcoin is a great example where one bit equals one vote, right? We really get to see a form of participation in action with Bitcoin and with the development.\nA lot of people have this idea particularly with wallet software, for example. Gavin, Mike Hearn, and Ben Davenport, all of them are talking about, \u2018Oh. You know we really need some development done in the wallet space\u2019. But at the end of the day, we have to find a way to do that sustainably and economically. And that\u2019s one of the reasons I find\nlead round investor, we raised half a million dollars for it. And I think the market will help us fund the development we need. I don\u2019t think we need to make Bitcoin a pet project unless we\u2019re willing to pay for it.\nLTB: Do you have plans to work with the Bitcoin Community, if so how will you deal with\nthe diversity of opinion?\nThis is a very important issue. We have a wide variety of vested financial interest now. We\u2019ve got Bitcoin users and they want the lowest costs in terms of time, money, and privacy. And then we\u2019ve got Bitcoin service providers and they have to comply with government regulators that want to increase those costs. They want AML compliance. They want KYC. And that can be diametrically opposed to our Bitcoin users. Why pay those extra costs if you don\u2019t have to. And if another altcoin introduces advancements that make it cheaper then we\u2019ll lose demand for Bitcoin and increase demand for the altcoin. So I think we have to remain competitive.\nAnd those service providers, they in effect, get to shift the cost from them to all holders of Bitcoin and I don\u2019t necessarily think that\u2019s right. You know if you want to do business in Venuatu and want to comply with local law there, I don\u2019t think that we should cater the protocol to lower your cost so that you can comply to regulators. I don\u2019t think that serves the users of Bitcoin, in general, the best way.\nLTB: Should the Foundation hire a lobbyist? If yes, why and where should they lobby?\nTM: That\u2019s a very good question. I\u2019ve actually presented to regulators and law enforcement and major banks and central banks even. You know what? They don\u2019t understand Bitcoin. They need to be educated about it.\nIs a lobbyist the best way to go about educating these policy makers? I don\u2019t know. I think that it\u2019s definitely a worthy idea to consider and to debate, but do we really want to be paying people to accomplish that? Do we really want to be taking funds that could be developed or be used for development, grants, or conferences, etcetera. And instead give it to these lobbyist that just kind of make their way in the world by groveling at the feet of people in power to pass legislation that helps the incumbents. I can see both sides of the issue. It\u2019s an area where I don\u2019t particularly have a lot of experience. I don\u2019t lobby on Capitol Hill, I do stuff instead.\nI think if we want to change the world, we need to change it in spite of anybody who might try to put roadblocks in our way. Whether we need to pay people to ask permission? I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see.\nLTB: If you had to change one thing about the Bitcoin Foundation, what would it be and why?\nTM: I think, I would like to change the ability to participate anonymously. And that\u2019s because when you give people a mask then they\u2019ll tell you the truth. And this will have wide ranging effects in all areas of the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nFor example, the amount of freedom we get is directly proportional to the degree of protection that we\u2019re able to secure. I think, far too much of what we\u2019re doing with the Foundation is focusing and catering to people that are not our core customers. For example, regulators, law enforcement, or governments. And if we can secure a lot more protection through the use of cryptography, development, etcetera, then we can provide a much better product to our customers.\nI think key to that is allowing people to participate anonymously. Perhaps, one of the reasons why we don\u2019t have anonymous participation is so that we can call out and censor the different ideas and the different voices that might actually make Bitcoin more useful, but wouldn\u2019t necessarily be helpful to regulators or law enforcement.\n\nIf you have enjoyed this interview, you can find the other candidates\u2019 interviews here:\nAaron LasherBen DavenportChristian KammlerDmitry (Rassah) MurashchikDuncan Goldie-ScotElizabeth PloshayJoerg PlatzerLuke-JrNilam DoctorNoah SilvermanRyan Deming", "year": 2013, "month": 9, "day": 4}

Levine (Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin):\u00a0Please Introduce Yourself and Give \u00a0a Brief Overview of what you hope to accomplish with your candidacy.\nBen Davenport:\u00a0My name\u2019s\u00a0Ben Davenport.\u00a0I live in Palo Alto, California, and currently work as a software engineer for Facebook. I\u2019ve been working in software engineering in one form or another for the past 16 years, including stints at Microsoft and Google. Most recently, I co-founded a mobile messaging startup called Beluga, which ended up getting acquired by Facebook and turning into Facebook Messenger.\n\nI think the Foundation is playing a very important role at a time that\u2019s somewhat of an inflection point for Bitcoin, which is why I think it\u2019s important we have a strong board. That\u2019s primarily what motivated me to run. I\u2019m pretty well connected to the Bitcoin community in Silicon Valley and I want to help represent that community on the Foundation board, as well as all Foundation members. I think at the current time, Bitcoin-based businesses are the most clear constituents in need of an organization like the Foundation, because it\u2019s the businesses that are in the crosshairs of government regulators in the US and elsewhere. If Bitcoin businesses can operate and grow successfully, then individual Bitcoin users will benefit right along side them.\nLTB:\u00a0Why do you want to serve on the Foundation Board?\nBD:\u00a0When the Bitcoin Foundation first started up, it wasn\u2019t really clear whether it was going to be something important or not. There was a lot of debate on that. I think over the last 6 months, that has really been clarified. First, it\u2019s clear that something like the Bitcoin Foundation is necessary to achieve anything close to an optimal outcome with respect to government regulation. Second, I think it\u2019s become increasingly apparent that the Foundation has actually been doing a pretty good job at that intended mission. I want to help continue that work, while helping grow the Foundation\u2019s membership and influence.\nNow, the Foundation is technically structured as a trade organization. It represents companies who operate in the space, as well as individual users of the currency. But I think one way to view Bitcoin is as a massively distributed open source startup itself. Owning BTC can be thought of as owning non-dilutable equity in that startup, and by proxy, owning a stake in the success of all startups who decide to do business with us by using BTC or building on the protocol. I think if you think of it like that, then the Foundation is really just like the PR, legal and lobbying departments of that startup (with a little bit of marketing and R&D spending thrown in). In this startup, those departments are actually really really important, because our competitors, while technically inferior, are extremely well entrenched and politically connected.\nAs I mentioned previously on my candidate thread, I think the primary mission of the Foundation ought to be to serve as a defender for Bitcoin while it is still in its infancy. And if we do our job successfully, Bitcoin can ultimately become too big to fail (in the good sense).\nLTB:\u00a0What makes you qualified for the position?\nBD:\u00a0I spoke already a bit about my technical and entrepreneurial background. When it comes to Bitcoin itself, I think what I bring to the table are a deep understanding of Bitcoin from both a monetary and a technical perspective, as well as significant social capital in terms of connections to people in the Bitcoin entrepreneurial and venture capital communities. I\u2019ve followed Bitcoin very closely since mid-2011, so I have a pretty good knowledge of the important history as well. I think I also bring a fairly balanced and pragmatic approach. While I\u2019m a libertarian, I recognize we live in a world full of powerful actors called governments. Ignoring the angry junkyard dog because you don\u2019t recognize his moral authority over you isn\u2019t generally a winning strategy.\nLTB:\u00a0Do you believe there is a right and wrong way to use a Bitcoin?\nBD:\u00a0Much like eating a Reese\u2019s, there is no wrong way to use a Bitcoin. If you try to use it in any \u201cwrong\u201d way, the transaction simply won\u2019t validate, and it will never appear in the blockchain. And if it isn\u2019t in the blockchain, the Bitcoin wasn\u2019t really used, was it? Of course, this only applies to Bitcoin you rightfully own stealing is wrong. As an aside for a moment: Bitcoin\u2019s history is littered with major thefts, but I think it\u2019s great that it\u2019s starting to be increasingly understood that it\u2019s not so easy to steal large amounts of bitcoin and actually do anything profitable with them. They can be tracked until the end of time.\nJust to expand a little, here are a few of the many right ways to use Bitcoin: saving it, spending it, buying it, selling it, investing it, wagering it, and yes, of course, speculating on it.\nLTB:\u00a0What are your views on Bitcoins software development?\nBD:\u00a0I think Bitcoin software development is special in some really important ways. For instance, normally, when you have an open protocol, it\u2019s typically always a good thing to have a variety of implementations competing with one another, and you want to avoid a monoculture, where a bad bug can take down the whole network. Well, obviously we have to carefully avoid bad bugs like that too, but in the case of Bitcoin, one of the worst problems is a fork in the chain due to inconsistencies in implementations or subtle bugs. We saw this earlier this year with the 1.7/1.8 fork, just in the reference Bitcoin client. It\u2019s particularly important that miners be running a somewhat consistent code base to avoid such situations. So, in the case of Bitcoin, the lesson may be more to put all your eggs in one basket, but watch that basket very very carefully. And be doubly careful when you upgrade your basket! That said, I think it\u2019s great that there are starting to be a number of other completely independent full node implementations out there.\nIn general, I think we all want Bitcoin development to happen faster. But at the same time, we have to balance speed with correctness. We\u2019re playing with real money here a billion and a half dollars equivalent, and that becomes more and more over time (generally). I think Gavin and the other core developers are doing a great job managing the project. And I hope over time the growing stature and importance of the project will continue to attract even more rock star contributors which will help us accomplish more, faster.\nOne of the nice things is there are a ton of ways that development that doesn\u2019t impact the protocol can happen completely independently of the core client development. Wallets, other full node implementations, additional protocols that ride on top of Bitcoin, and so forth.\nLTB:\u00a0Do you have plans to work with the Bitcoin Community, if so how will you deal with the diversity of opinion?\nBD:\u00a0I think actively reaching out and talking to the entrepreneurs and companies who are active in the space is really important in understanding what the Foundation ought to be focusing on. I already have personal connections to many entrepreneurs in the space, for instance, Brian at Coinbase, Tony at BitPay, Charlie at BitInstant, Jered at Tradehill, Jaron at Coinsetter as well as a number of other companies, including earlier-stage exchanges, wallets and other types of businesses.\nAs a board member, I plan to continue my efforts to make personal connections with other entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and members of the community. I plan to regularly touch base with these people to understand what sort of issues they\u2019re encountering where the Foundation can be of help.\nAs far as diversity of opinion, there\u2019s clearly a wide spectrum of views within the Bitcoin Foundation. But there\u2019s also a lot of common ground we likely agree on ultimately we all want what\u2019s best for Bitcoin. On issues where I don\u2019t have a strong opinion from the outset, I would try to keep an open mind when talking to different members of the community to learn about all the factors involved. I\u2019d try to get a sense for what the range of opinions is, and if my opinion ended up being far off on one side or the other, I\u2019d want to examine that pretty closely.\nLTB:\u00a0Should the Foundation hire a lobbyist? If yes, why and where should they lobby \u00a0(D.C., NY, CA, London, Berlin, etc)?\nBD:\u00a0Yes, I think almost certainly. The Foundation isn\u2019t really a central point of control for Bitcoin, but one of its main purposes is to be a central point of influence and education in the political sphere. Hiring one or more lobbyists is an important step in that direction. Of course the information flows two ways in lobbying, and I think right now, listening and understanding how governments are starting to grapple with Bitcoin is as important as doing the talking, and will ultimately help shape the message we bring back to politicians and regulators.\nThat said, I think we have to make sure we hire the right lobbyists, and that we develop a coherent plan to get the most bang for our buck in terms of our lobbying efforts. We don\u2019t have anywhere close to the same resources the big banks do (YET!), so I think we really need to focus on where we can have the largest ROI. Right now, of course, the focus is on D.C. and the states, because the US is an extremely important market, with many Bitcoin startups currently. But I think it is probably equally important to have someone focusing on what\u2019s going on in the EU.\nLTB:\u00a0If you had to change one thing about the Bitcoin Foundation, what would it be and why?\nBD:\u00a0I would increase its membership 100x, and find a way to scale its efforts internationally in an effective way.\nIf you have enjoyed this interview, you can find the other candidates\u2019 interviews here:\nAaron LasherBen DavenportChristian KammlerDmitry (Rassah) MurashchikDuncan Goldie-ScotElizabeth PloshayJoerg PlatzerLuke-JrNilam DoctorNoah SilvermanRyan DemingTrace Mayer", "year": 2013, "month": 9, "day": 3}
{"title": "In Defense of Alternative Cryptocurrencies", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/defense-alternative-cryptocurrencies/", "birthday": "Sep 7, 2013  5:55 AM EST", "date": "2013-09-07 10:55:00", "content": "Alternative cryptocurrencies, like\u00a0Litecoin,\u00a0Primecoin\u00a0and\u00a0PPCoin, have gotten a significant amount of bad press recently. Lead Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen wrote\u00a0an article\u00a0criticizing altcoins as being a way of getting around Bitcoin\u2019s\u00a021 million currency supply limit\u00a0and \u201cgetting back to an \u2018inflate on demand\u2019 world\u201d and, more recently, Daniel Krawisz from The Mises Circle wrote a lengthy post entitled\u00a0\u201cThe Problem with Altcoins\u201d, raising many other concerns. Krawisz\u2019s arguments received a\u00a0substantial amount of support\u00a0from the Bitcoin community, showing that there are many Bitcoin users who disapprove of alternative cryptocurrencies in principle. Quite a lot of the time, the arguments made against specific alternative cryptocurrencies are justified; however, a strong case can be made that the position provided by Krawisz \u2013 that altcoins are bad in principle, and not just in implementation, goes too far.\nThe first argument that many people raise against alternative currencies \u2013 although, fortunately, one that is ignored by both Andresen and Krawisz, is that most of them offer essentially no value over Bitcoin itself.\u00a0IXCoin\u00a0is nothing more than Bitcoin with a steeper currency supply curve, flattening out around 2020.\u00a0Feathercoin\u00a0is a clone of Litecoin with the only major change being that the final currency supply is 336 million instead of 84 million, although Feathercoin developers do emphasize the currency\u2019s well-maintained and active community as a counterpoint. Anoncoin is a\u00a0version of Bitcoin\u00a0that works over the anonymizing network\u00a0I2P\u00a0\u2013 certainly a valuable feature for I2P users, but a superfluous one now that I2P clients exist for\u00a0Bitcoin itself. And it\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s \u201cAmerican\u201d about\u00a0AmericanCoin, \u201cChinese\u201d about\u00a0ChinaCoin\u00a0or particularly \u201cglobal\u201d about\u00a0Worldcoin. These are all good arguments against those individual cryptocurrencies; however, when used as an argument against alternative cryptocurrencies in general, the fallacy becomes obvious. The fact that most altcoins offer little value and are forever doomed to the obscurity of sub-$1 million market caps is actually rather unsurprising; in fact, it is exactly what you would expect the alternative currency ecosystem to produce. It has been known for years that\u00a090% of small businesses fail, and the principle has been generalized as\u00a0Sturgeon\u2019s Law: ninety percent of everything is junk. Did anyone ever expect that alternative cryptocurrencies would be any different?\nHowever, the two do make a number of other arguments against alternative currencies. Krawisz makes a lengthy post detailing a number of arguments both against specific currencies and altcoins in general, whereas Gavin Andresen\u2019s article on the subject is much shorter, and focuses specifically on one particular problem: inflation. Andresen writes:\nOne of the big appeals to me for Bitcoin is the fact that it is inflation-proof\u2013 the supply of Bitcoin is fixed and completely predictable. Everybody knows that 21 million Bitcoins will be produced, and everybody knows approximately how quickly they will be produced.Creating gazillions of alt-coins seems to me to just be a way of getting back to an \u201cinflate on demand\u201d world. Not enough genuine Bitcoin money for you? No problem! Create a new alt-coin to produce more!\nMeanwhile, the core of the Krawisz\u2019s argument is this:\nA medium of exchange that is more widely accepted on the market is more useful than one which is not. This is known as the network effect. Thus, an initial imbalance between two nearly equal media of exchange will benefit whichever is more widely accepted until a single one overwhelms the rest. There is no limit to this effect: ultimately one would always expect a single currency to overcome all its competitors.\nThe first thing that one needs to notice at this point is this:\u00a0these two arguments are mutually exclusive. If Krawisz is correct, and there will inevitable be one cryptocoin dominating the market, then the only way an altcoin can succeed is by replacing Bitcoin entirely. Thus, there will not be any pseudo-inflation through multiple currencies. If, on the other hand, the total currency supply expands due to multiple coins being on the market simultaneously, then that will prove wrong Krawisz\u2019s assertion that the cryptocurrency market necessarily tends toward monopoly. If one opposes altcoins, one must therefore choose to oppose them from Andresen\u2019s line of reasoning or that of Krawisz; one cannot take both.\nMy personal position is that Andresen\u2019s argument is technically correct, although the potential for it to cause price inflation is somewhat overstated. If alternative currencies have a future at all, it will be a future where cryptocurrency in general becomes more prominent, not less. In such a world, the larger problem is not price inflation (ie. Bitcoin\u2019s value going down); rather, it is price deflation \u2013 Bitcoin\u2019s value going up. Why is this a problem? First of all, nearly everyone agrees that having wealth be more equally distributed across many individuals is a good thing; opponents of wealth redistribution, by and large, only target the methods (eg. inflation and taxation) by which redistribution is attempted in practice. If altcoins cause Bitcoin\u2019s value to go up by a factor of fifty rather than a hundred, and thus give rise to, say, fifty people split between five currencies with $1 billion each rather than ten people with $5 billion each, then by all standard measures of welfare economics that will be a positive outcome.\nSecond, it is the very potential for Bitcoin\u2019s value to go so high up that makes the currency so unstable. When Bitcoin had its bubble to $266 in April, the reason why the market bounced back and forth so wildly before settling down around $100 is that the stakes were so high; everyone knew that, if successful, Bitcoin\u2019s value can reach as high as $10,000 to $1 million, and the wild swings in prices represented people\u2019s varying estimations of the probability that Bitcoin will indeed see such a success. However, if it is understood that if Bitcoin succeeds there will also be many other altcoins, then Bitcoin\u2019s value might only end up between $2,000 and $200,000 in the case of extreme success \u2013 creating a lower \u201cceiling\u201d on what the price can be and thus narrowing the range within which estimates of Bitcoin\u2019s value can take place. The net result of this will, in fact, be reduced volatility \u2013 a positive outcome for people who are looking into Bitcoin as a store of value to protect themselves from having their\u00a0bank deposits confiscated\u00a0or their\u00a0pension plan nationalized, and not as a \u201cmaybe get rich quick\u201d investment. There is certainly nothing immoral about the latter, but the far larger value that Bitcoin can provide ultimately rests in the former. Once the cryptocurrency market is mature, we can expect cryptocurrencies to go down just as often as new ones come up, so the currency supply should remain roughly stable in any case.\nOne Cryptocoin To Rule Them All\nBut the above still does not address the main point that Krawisz makes \u2013 namely, that because cryptocurrencies benefit from network effects, there must necessarily eventually be one cryptocurrency dominating the market. In general, the principle that network effects create a tendency toward monopoly is a valid one. The core idea is that some goods (or standards, platforms or protocols) are inherently more useful if more people use them; for example, a radio would be essentially useless two thousand years ago simply because there were no other people with radios to talk to. When applied to protocols and standards, this means that a standard that gathers more users immediately becomes more useful by virtue of having more users alone, and so even more users adopt it, creating a positive feedback loop that ultimately culminates in one or a few standards establishing market dominance.\nWe can see this effect in the real world in many places. There are still hundreds of languages in widespread use today, but the reason why this status quo survives is that there is still not yet much of a global network for network effects to work off of; by and large, Chinese people talk to other Chinese people and Americans talk to other Americans, so different languages can come to dominate in different regions. In areas where this is false, like aviation and international business, English dominates worldwide. As another example, Krawisz writes, \u201cSuppose automobiles had just been invented and two groups, because of vested financial interests, got into arguments about whether it was better to drive on the left or the right side of the road.\u201d For obvious reasons, every such conflict in the real world has now been resolved; left-side driving only remains in\u00a0highly contiguous pockets\u00a0of the world \u2013 that is to say, self-contained regions where network effects (ie. people driving across borders) are small enough for the discrepancy to be tolerable. In the area of social networking, Facebook remains by far the most popular of its kind, although its importance diminishes somewhat if you include into the category of \u201csocial networking\u201d things like Twitter, online forums and email.\nIn the context of alternative cryptocurrencies, however, the last example is particularly pertinent. It is virtually guaranteed that no company will be able to \u201cbeat Facebook\u201d by simply being a different version of Facebook \u2013 as opposed to restaurants, where network effects are virtually nonexistent and anyone can set a new restaurant up and be moderately successful without offering any particular innovation. However, the services that have survived Facebook are those that can work alongside it, and have different properties that make them far superior for some particular use cases; Twitter and email are the obvious examples.\nPerhaps, it will be the same with Bitcoin. Bitcoin itself is not nearly perfect for every use case; transactions take up to sixty minutes to confirm depending on the desired level of security, the system is not completely micropayment-friendly, and its scripting system is very limited compared to what it could be. Imagine, for example, a Bitcoin address that allows one private key to spend up to 0.1 BTC per day and the other to spend everything. Such a system would be a boon for security and applications like recurring billing; however, the current scripting system does not allow reading transaction values or past transactions. A future coin might. Ripple allows users to\u00a0set up their own currencies\u00a0and includes a decentralized exchange; Bitcoin does not. Bitcoin\u2019s slow confirmations are already solved by\u00a0Primecoin, whose blocks take one minute to confirm. Bitcoin\u2019s lack of ability to (easily) include messages along with transactions is solved by\u00a0Neocoin.\nBut then, the obvious question is, why use altcoins for all these things? Why not integrate advanced scripting, rapid block confirmations, lower transaction fees and messages into Bitcoin itself? In theory, it could be done. In practice, however, there are several reasons why it should be done and several reasons why it simply will not be done. First of all, complexity is bad. If nothing else, the\u00a0blockchain fork\u00a0in March 2013, where the Bitcoin network literally split in half for six hours because of a discrepancy between two pieces of database software, made this all too clear. If the Bitcoin network can be brought to its knees by an obscure database limit that Bitcoin developers did not even know existed, then imagine how well a version of Bitcoin with dozens of interlinking parts and dependencies would fare. If advanced features are implemented in an altcoin, however, the risk of failure is lower in each one, and if an altcoin falls down due to a technical glitch there will be far fewer people using that coin to store millions of dollars or make business-critical financial transactions who stand to suffer. Even if one does not take into account the risk of failure, complexity is harmful simply because it makes it more difficult to create alternative implementations of the software, stifling innovation in software development and leading to a kind of centralization by the backdoor.\nSecond, there is the matter of resources. Consider the case of Neocoin. Many Bitcoin developers are dead-set against integrating messages into the blockchain; when blockchain.info tried to implement such a system using zero-valued outputs, a number of Bitcoin developers, including Gavin Andresen himself,\u00a0heavily criticized the initiative. Bitcoin developer Luke Dashjr wrote: \u201cData does not belong in the blockchain. People running nodes have all implicitly agreed to store the blocks for financial purposes, and storing data is a violation of that social contract.\u201d The fear is that if the Bitcoin blockchain becomes recognized as a place to store messages, and people start using it as an email and instant messaging (or worse, file sharing) service, then network load would balloon massively and the blockchain would grow to many terabytes in size. With Neocoin, if that happens no one would have any cause to complain; the community would work on reducing the storage requirements, including potentially modifying the mining algorithm to remove the need for every miner to maintain a full blockchain. Similarly,\u00a0Zerocoin, with its multi-kilobyte anonymous transactions, can grow to function as an effective mixing service on its own currency without saddling the Bitcoin network with additional data or the Bitcoin source code with advanced mathematics that even most professional cryptographers do not understand. Sure, the total amount of data would be the same, or even greater due to the need to exchange between the different currencies, but each individual would only need to worry about those blockchains that are relevant to them.\nSwitching Costs Go to Zero\nAll of the above arguments show the advantages of having different blockchains. But there is also a strong argument to make that the\u00a0disadvantage\u00a0of having multiple currencies is really not all that great. Krawisz cites several examples to show how competition between standards can be bad; aside from the example of driving on the left and right side of the road, he asks: \u201cdo we really need competition between the mile and the kilometer, for example?\u201d The fallacy here is this. Miles, kilometers, traditional currencies and road regulations are all standards meant to be used by humans. Faced with a dual-measurement-unit system, we as individuals need to keep track in our heads the fact that one mile is 1.6 kilometers and one kilogram is 2.2 pounds, and use mental arithmetic to convert between the two as needed. In the case of the dual standard of \u201cmiles per gallon\u201d and \u201cliters per 100 kilometers\u201d, the situation is even worse: one is an inverse of the other, so MPG going up is good whereas L/100KM going up is bad. If different cities had different road regulations, not only would drivers need to remember which side of the road to drive on in each city, but every boundary would need to have some kind of special streetlight or crossover bridge to allow drivers to switch from one to the other in real time.\nCryptocurrencies, on the other hand, are different. Because the actual handling of currency is done in software, bridge applications that allow people to send one currency to an address in another currency through an exchange can easily be created if necessary; Ripple recently introduced a tool that allows Ripple users to\u00a0send directly to Bitcoin addresses\u00a0by using the gateways in the Ripple network. Multi-currency wallets are also another possibility. Altogether, we have the tools to completely abstract away currency divisions from the user, and treat them purely as a technical problem; users need only choose the unit of account to store their money in, and peer-to-peer decentralized exchanges can take care of the rest.\nBitcoin itself suffers from a network effects deficiency against fiat currencies; currently, everyone uses fiat currencies, putting Bitcoin at a considerable disadvantage at least in these early stages of its growth. Bitcoin has only been able to overcome this problem simply because there are some circumstances in which it is simply so vastly superior that even the massive network effects of the euro and US dollar were not enough to overcome its advantages. Once Bitcoin wins, Krawisz argues, altcoins will be in a similar situation. \u201cTo defeat Bitcoin, an altcoin would require not just superior technology, but such vastly superior technology as to be an advance over Bitcoin comparable to the advance Bitcoin represents over fiat currency,\u201d Krawisz writes. However, this argument is false. The reason is that network effects are not the only factor driving standards toward monopoly; the other major factor is switching costs. Making the switch from fiat currency to Bitcoin is quite difficult, and creating bridge services that work between the two is a multi-million dollar affair involving placating established banking partners and complying with a large body of regulation.\nThe path from one cryptocurrency to another is much simpler. Anyone can set up an anonymous exchange over Tor, and it may even be possible to make trust-free decentralized exchanges between currencies using Bitcoin\u2019s underlying cryptography directly. For a merchant accepting Bitcoin, if alternative currencies gather any popularity at all then switching to Litecoin or Primecoin will be a simple matter of downloading a patch. It is even possible for a merchant to accept every cryptocurrency at the same time. Certainly, a new currency will need to be substantially better than Bitcoin to overtake it, and Bitcoin\u2019s status as the first cryptocurrency out there gives it special unique value (much like \u201cthe original\u201d of any painting is worth thousands of times more than even the most visually indistinguishable replica). However, as far as adoption is concerned, it is perhaps the chief benefit of cryptocurrency that it massively reduces the height of the \u201chump\u201d that every new currency innovator will need to overcome in the future.\nScrypt-coins\nKrawisz then proceeds to argue against the merits of specific alternative cryptocurrencies. He first attacks so-called \u201cScrypt-coins\u201d, of which Litecoin is currently the most popular.\u00a0Scrypt\u00a0is a hash algorithm, much like the SHA256, but with the main difference that Scrypt is designed to require a large amount of both processing power and memory to compute. Essentially, the way it does this is by pre-computing millions of intermediate values and then randomly selecting inputs from these values to generate the final result. A computer evaluating the Scrypt hash of a message (or, in this case, a block) must either keep all of these intermediate values in memory throughout the computation or re-compute the values every time they are needed, which is prohibitively slow. The benefit of using Scrypt instead of SHA256 for mining is that it becomes more difficult to create specialized miners that compute millions of hashes in parallel; with Scrypt, if you want to make an ASIC that computes hashes fifty thousand times faster than a CPU, then you will also need to include terabytes of RAM. This does not remove the potential for ASIC miners, but it does make them less efficient, allowing average users on CPUs and GPUs to continue mining without getting ruthlessly outcompeted by special-purpose hardware.\nKrawisz, of course, disapproves of this idea. He compares the effort to create coins that average users can mine to the\u00a0Candlemaker\u2019s Petition, a satirical petition by the French economist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat featuring a candlemaker asking the government to, among other things, ban windows to protect his business from the competition of the sun. As a criticism of protectionist economic policies, the Candlemaker\u2019s petition makes an excellent argument. The reason why the candlemaker\u2019s request is harmful is that if his business relies on government intervention in the form of banning windows to continue operating, then the business is not providing any actual value to society in the first place; if his candles did provide value, people would be willing to spend money on them. Artificially maintaining a business that does not provide value makes no sense; if the candlemaker\u2019s welfare is of concern, it is a far better solution to let the unproductive business die and supplement the merchant\u2019s income through charity or a welfare program than to continue wasting resources.\nAs a criticism of Scrypt, however, the argument is not nearly so robust. In the case of the candlemaker, the product to society was light; the more light people get when they need it the better. In the case of cryptocurrency mining, however, the product to society is not hash calculations; by themselves, hash calculations are useless. Rather, it is producing more hash calculations than any potential attacker. Because the \u201cmemory-hardness\u201d of Scrypt mining harms legitimate miners and attackers alike, its effect with regard to security is ultimately neutral; thus, this is not a case of artificially hamstringing one part of the economy to give another part a \u201cfair chance\u201d. Because mining is a competitive activity, both in terms of individual miners\u2019 day-to-day operations and in terms of its ultimate purpose, many economic theories that work perfectly well for commodities fall flat on their face when applied to Bitcoin mining. The reality is that the economics of Bitcoin mining remains a heavily under-studied area, and much more research needs to be done before we understand what is truly going on.\nFast Block Confirmation Times\nThe topic of block confirmations is best explained by Krawisz himself:\nThe issue here is the risk of a double-spend attack. If you receive notice of a payment from someone, there is the possibility that he has made a second, conflicting payment using the same bitcoins. In this case, there is the chance that the other payment will be accepted into the block chain rather than yours, and yours will be considered invalid. This is a theoretical means of scamming Bitcoin merchants.\nHowever, Krawisz then proceeds to make the following claim:\nFurthermore, a double-spend attack is only possible if the two conflicting transactions occur within a few seconds of one another, so the best defense against double spending is simply to watch the network for a few seconds after receiving a payment. If no conflicting payments appear then there is nothing to fear from double spending.\nUnfortunately, this is not necessarily true. A double-spend\u00a0without mining power\u00a0certainly does meet these restrictions. However, if an attacker with a substantial amount of mining power creates a double spending transaction, and then builds a blockchain with that transaction longer than the main blockchain, then Bitcoin nodes will still discard the old one and switch to the new one. So far, developers have rejected any attempt to change that fact because the risk is too high that it will break down network consensus and lead to a blockchain fork if different miners see incoming blocks in a different order and thus disagree on what the \u201ccorrect\u201d blockchain is.\nUltimately, against attackers with a substantial mining power, waiting for the network to \u201cconfirm\u201d the transaction is the only solution. This takes ten minutes with Bitcoin, but 2.5 minutes with Litecoin and one minute with Primecoin. Even here, however, attackers with 1-49% of the network\u2019s mining power can still sometimes get lucky and produce several blocks in a row; to prevent this, six confirmations is the accepted standard, ensuring that attacks have a 1 in 64 chance of success with 33% of the network\u2019s hashpower, 1 in 729 with 25% hashpower and 1 in 15625 with 17% hashpower. Note that it is the number of confirmations, not the number of minutes, that counts; thus, while Bitcoin takes an hour to achieve this level of security, Primecoin does it in six minutes.\nPrimecoin\nNext, Krawisz turns his attention to Primecoin, a cryptocurrency whose main innovation is the fact that its mining algorithm is intended to be actually useful. Rather than using SHA256 computations, Primecoin requires miners to look for long \u201cCunningham chains\u201d of prime numbers \u2013 chains of values\u00a0n-1,\u00a02n-1,\u00a04n-1, etc up to some length such that all of the values in the chain are prime (for the sake of accuracy,\u00a0n+1,\u00a02n+1,\u00a04n+1\u00a0can also be a valid Cunningham chain, and Primecoin also accepts \u201cbi-twin chains\u201d of the form\u00a0n-1,\u00a0n+1,\u00a02n-1,\u00a02n+1\u2026 where all terms are prime). It is not immediately obvious how these chains are useful \u2013 Primecoin advocates have pointed to a\u00a0few\u00a0theoretical\u00a0applications, but these all require only chains of length 3 which are trivial to produce. However, the stronger argument is that in modern Bitcoin mining the majority of the production cost of mining hardware is actually researching methods of mining more efficiently (ASICs, optimized circuits, etc) and not building or running the devices themselves, and in a Primecoin world this research would go towards finding more efficient ways of doing arithmetic and number theory computation instead \u2013 things which have applications far beyond just mining cryptocurrencies.\nKrawisz\u2019s attack on Primecoin is simple: \u201cPrimecoin is a wuzzle. It tries to do two unrelated things at once, which, generally speaking, is the opposite of a good design.\u201d In most cases, this is a valid argument; it is a core part of the\u00a0Unix philosophy\u00a0that applications should \u201cdo one thing and do it well\u201d. A device that attempts to be a baseball bat and a water bottle at the same time will likely fail at both, being too heavy to carry around as a bottle and too unpredictable due to internal water flows to serve as a reliable bat. However, here the situation is different, because Primecoin\u2019s two purposes are fundamentally different in character: one is a private good, whereas the other is a public good. Primecoin\u2019s value as a currency is enjoyed by those who choose to use it and only those who choose to use it; hence, this is the private component of the good that Primecoin offers. However, the scientific research that Primecoin generates is public in nature; the results will be usable by anyone, regardless of whether they used or mined Primecoin or not.\nIt is a well-understood fact in economics that public goods are underproduced in a pure market. For example, suppose that there is a community of ten thousand people, and it is publicly known that if people contribute $1 million, then some disease will be cured. Furthermore, everyone knows that, without a cure, they will all suffer from this disease at some point, and so everyone is, theoretically, willing to pay $5,000 for a working cure. If everyone contributed $100 toward curing the disease, then the $1 million goal would be reached and the disease would be cured, leading to a $4,900 benefit for everyone. However, from each individual\u2019s point of view, contributing $100 only leads to 0.01% progress toward curing the disease \u2013 a personal benefit of only $0.50, not nearly enough to justify the expense.\nThe way such problems are generally solved is by bundling the public good with a private good. For example, suppose that one quarter of these people were all customers of the same health insurance agency (it can be a private company, a cooperative or an arm of the government; the distinction is not particularly relevant in this simplified example). The agency could spend $1 million curing the disease, but then save the $5,000 that it would have spent paying for the treatment of each of its 2,500 customers, leading to a net gain of $11.5 million. The public goods problem is solved because a private good, in this case insurance, was bundled with the public good of curing the disease \u2013 in Krawisz\u2019s terms, a wuzzle. Primecoin accomplishes the exact same thing. It bundles a private good, namely its own block reward, with the public good of advancing research into scientific computation. Arguably, this is much closer to economic genius than \u201cbad design\u201d.\nThe argument that Krawisz ends off with is this: if these features are so good, why do they need to be in their own currencies? Why can\u2019t the developers of these features ask the Bitcoin developers to put these features into Bitcoin instead? One argument that I already made is that modifying Bitcoin at this point is simply too risky to be worth it; however, an even better rebuttal can be made by simply flipping the argument on its head. Why did Satoshi have to create his own currency? Why couldn\u2019t he have simply been a good little consumer and filled out a suggestion form asking his local bank to implement a semi-anonymous and global value transfer mechanism instead? If inflation is the problem, why couldn\u2019t he have engaged in legitimate democratic process and petitioned his government to add a hard currency supply limit to his local fiat currency instead? Why couldn\u2019t he have just nicely asked Paypal to offer a payment option that is irreversible?\nThe answer is obvious. Sometimes, people in control of powerful and established institutions are either irrational or simply factually wrong, and there needs to be an outlet for people to try out new ideas with or without their support. If the idea fails, then it goes into the dustbin of history where it belongs. If, on the other hand, the idea succeeds, then it is a very good thing that the idea\u2019s inventor was able to simply ignore the initial skepticism and go ahead with the project. Governments and banks are stubborn about a lot of things, but Bitcoin developers do also have their points of stubbornness as well. Perhaps they are right, but perhaps they are wrong \u2013 but in either case, a real-world market is the best way we have to find out for sure.", "year": 2013, "month": 9, "day": 7}

Sean\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Outpost, a homeless shelter in Pensacola, Florida run by Jason King, first started accepting Bitcoin in March 2013, carrying a simple message: \"When we break down cost, it runs about $1.25 to make a bagged lunch and get it delivered to a homeless person. 40 meals = $50. $50 is K1 BTC. Here is your chance to make a guaranteed, phenomenal return on your investment. Donating 1 bitcoin right now will put food in the tummies of 40 homeless people.\" Four days later, Sean\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Outpost had raised over over $600, and over the months that followed Sean\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Outpost and the Bitcoin community developed a symbiosis closer than either had thought would happen. King has become a regular presence on the Bitcoin Reddit community, participated as a speaker in the 2013 San Jose Bitcoin conference, and even ran as an candidate to become an industry member of the Bitcoin Foundation. Five months later, Sean\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Outpost has collected over $30,000 in Bitcoin funds. Now, Sean\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Outpost is going to be expanding much further than anyone imagined.\n\nEnter Satoshi Forest. The location at 1999 Massachusetts Ave, Pensacola, FL encompasses nine acres of wooded land that will now become, as Jason King describes it, \"a homeless sanctuary, a place where the downtrodden can find respite from the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'crime\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' of being simply being poor.\" The property cost $89,000 to purchase, which, King writes, \"for acreage within the developed part of greater Pensacola, is dirt cheap.\" The mortgage on the property, valued at $600 per month, will be paid entirely in Bitcoin - not, King clarifies, by converting the BTC donations that they receive into USD, but sending bitcoins directly to the mortgage holder as payment. The mortgage holder is in fact a real-estate company with properties in Florida, Alabama, Colorado and California and, thanks to the Sean\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Outpost crew\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s efforts, the company is now accepting Bitcoin for its entire portfolio.\nKing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s description of homelessness as a \"crime\" is no exaggeration; recently, the Pensacola City Council passed a \"camping ban\" ordinance that prohibited, among other things, sleeping outside or in a temporary shelter, washing, shaving, washing one\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s clothing or preparing food in public, public urination and \"aggressive solicitation, begging or panhandling\". \"I have been told that if I bring someone freezing [who is sleeping outside] a blanket, I will be aiding and abetting in a crime,\" King wrote in a recent interview. In fact, King was forced to keep Satoshi Forest secret until now simply because he was afraid that, even though everything he is doing is entirely legal under the \"no camping\" ordinance and Pensacola zoning law, \"someone could come in and stop us at any moment\". Fortunately, no one did. \"It happened,\" King writes, \"it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s done. Satoshi Forest is real. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not shipping in two weeks. You can go to 1999 Massachusetts Ave. in Pensacola and put your hands on it. And we just got our filed deed back from the county, so it is most definitely ours. And by ours, I mean the collective goodwill of the Crypto Currency community.\"\nThe Sean\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Outpost crew, including Jason King himself as well as his wife Leslie, Mike Kimberl and Adam Richard, intends to use Satoshi Forest as the base for a number of projects. The first, and most obvious, are the \"BitHouses\". As the name suggests, the BitHouses are intended to serve as proper homes for the homeless, and will be designed as \"recreational vehicles\" (ie. houses on wheels) and not static houses or buildings in part to reduce the risk that zoning rules and inspection requirements will be used against them, and in part so that people can leave with them \"if they get on their feet and want to move to their own space.\" One of these homes will be able to house two people - \"up to four if you are \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'really familiar\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' with that person,\" and will each cost about 65 BTC to produce. The houses will also be sold to the public One Laptop Per Child-style: you pay for two, one goes to the homeless and one for yourself. Although construction is starting in the fall, weather should not be a problem; \"One of our first \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'projects\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' in the forest is the construction of a large pole barn that we will be able to accomplish all of the construction underneath.\"\nBut Satoshi Forest will not stop there. Once housing construction is well underway, they also intend to add a large kitchen for preparing food, and then begin organic farming operations which he later intends to expand to aquaculture. Ultimately, King writes, \"we envision Satoshi Forest morphing into an organic farm/makerspace with a Summer Camp feel. Apart from the obvious of growing food to further our operations, learning how to farm is an invaluable skill and one that is slowly being taken away by the corporate food monopolies. There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s something damn near magical about showing someone how to plant and grow their own food. There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not much more pride to be had then eating food you grew. Construction/Makerspace is the same, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s showing someone that they have abilities to turn a stack of raw materials into something of value.\" The \"summer camp\" aspect is also important; \"everyone at summercamp lives in conditions very similar to being homeless,\" King explains, \"but no one is looked upon like being a worthless piece of garbage.\"\nAnd ultimately that is what Sean\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Outpost and Satoshi Forest are all about: providing food for the homeless and giving them blankets to keep warm, but also being a place where \"people who have no hope can find a little, learn a skill, find people who look at them as fellow humans.\" At one point, King found a man under a local bridge who had been put on the streets in little more than boxer shorts after being admitted to an emergency room following a cardiac attack. \"He was really depressed,\" King recalls, \"[he] felt like the whole world was against him.\" As it turned out, the man was a decorated Marine veteran and a master carpenter, and once Sean\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Outpost took him in he even helped provide ideas for the housing construction projects. Over time, he started getting better, worked odd jobs to save up money to buy a van, and \"as of last week he actually has a full-time job and an apartment.\"\nSean\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Outpost has become a testament to both Bitcoin and the ideals that many in the Bitcoin community hold dear. One and a half years ago, Jon Matonis wrote an article entitled \"Could Bitcoin Become the Currency of System D?\", where System D refers to the underground and informal economy that makes up one sixth of the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s GDP. The \"D\" stands for \"d\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\xc3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\x83\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\xc2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\xa9brouillardise\", a French word perhaps best translated as \"MacGyverism\" - using the natural human capacity for creativity and ingenuity to take maximal advantage of limited resources to solve complex and meaningful problems. We can see this in the real world everywhere; people in France and Spain laying down an array of sunglasses on a towel and selling them for a few dollars each every day, vendors selling food on the street, and much of the informal person-to-person trade that happens over the internet.Much of this trade is never registered in censuses or tax forms, and operating costs and revenues are very low, and yet the value generated by this so-called \"shadow economy\" for its participants is all too real. In fact, this economy often acts as a crucial safety net to keep people alive in those places where formal economies and governments are simply not there. Sean\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Outpost, in many ways, is similar. Rather than being a project dreamed up by bureaucrats seeking to get people into \"the system\" as quickly as possible, and earn generous salaries along the way, Sean\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Outpost is a grassroots operation borne out of compassion and experience interacting with real people, and stretches every dollar (or rather, every bitcent) far more than most people can hope to achieve. In a time when many people simply don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have the money to pay increasingly high mortgages and rent, the fact that Sean\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Outpost can produce a fully-functional home for two to four people for less than ten thousand dollars, and pay for a meal for $1.25, is hugely invaluable for the people it serves. The shelter is funded by donations from thousands of people around the world, North Americans and Europeans, rich and poor, individuals and corporations alike; in this regard, it is one of the best examples of the entire Bitcoin community pooling its resources together.\nNow that Satoshi Forest has gotten through the initial hurdle of setting itself up, the harder work is about to begin. Building homes for dozens of people is no small task, and it will take many months to set up the housing and organic farming projects. Once it is complete, though, Satoshi Forest can be a model for many similar projects elsewhere. It does not even need to be specifically about the poor and homeless; many people voluntarily choose seemingly \"lower class\" lifestyles either because they want to work on projects that benefit the community but which are not monetarily well-rewarded, or simply because they prefer a more communitarian means of living; there are already a number of communities in Europe which are organized around precisely that model. A homeless shelter in Florida, specialized startup incubators and living spaces in Silicon Valley, a city district in Berlin, and meetup in hundreds of cities around the world all point to one conclusion: Bitcoin has become much more than just a currency.", "year": 2013, "month": 9, "day": 9}

The Ministry announces that Bitcoins are officially recognized. Some weeks ago already the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) amended a guidance to the definition of \u201cfinancial instruments\u201c in the German Banking Code and stated that Bitcoins are financial instruments. Through this official recognition and definition of Bitcoins Germany has become the first country in the world that sets clear-cut rules for Bitcoins.\nHowever, there are some drawbacks: Bitcoin companies must meet strict standards as they are now in principle regarded as financial service companies which must be licensed and will be supervised by BaFin. Inter alia the following conditions must be met:\n\nInitial capital of 730.000 Euros\nManagement must be professionally qualified\nA detailed business plan must be submitted\nCapital adequacy standards must be met\nAML mechanisms must be implemented\nReports must be submitted to BaFin regularly\n\nWith regard to the first criterion and including all other necessary expenses start-up costs should be somewhere near 1 million Euros. Yearly operating costs would also be fairly high.\nOn the other hand, however, Germany\u2018s clear-cut rules should facilitate access of Bitcoin companies to venture capital as VC companies now deal with a manageable regulatory environment. Especially Berlin is full of innovative start-ups and also has huge pools of venture capital.\nIn addition, cooperation with banks should be more easily conceivable as banks can now place Bitcoin companies in the regulatory framework and know what standards they must fulfill.\nOther digital currencies (e.g. Ripples, Litecoins etc.) are also classified as financial instruments.\nOperating without the necessary license is punishable as a criminal offense. Having a license permits doing business in other countries of the European Economic Area (the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) through the European financial passport scheme although it is not quite clear how this will work as long as other European countries have not classified Bitcoins.\nBaFin may grant exemptions from some of the above mentioned rules. It appears overly zealous to apply rules which are tailored to the \u201ctraditional\u201c finance industry with a daily turnover in the trillions to a budding industry with a total global market capitalization of about one billion. This would probably need to be addressed on a political level though. The Merkel government has recently indicated that it is willing to support start-up companies in areas of technological innovation.\nIn addition, \u201cfinancial instruments\u201c is an extremely broad term which comprises shares as well as credit default swaps and therefore may justify further adaptations based on the specific features inherent to a particular financial instrument.\nThrough this move the global discussion has become more complicated. Germany straightforwardly says Bitcoins are financial instruments, in the United States FinCEN says they are a \u201cvirtual currency\u201c, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission says they are a \u201ccommodity\u201d, and a judge in Texas has no doubts they are simply \u201cmoney\u201c, and in Thailand the central bank says they don\u2018t know what it is and therefore it\u2018s illegal. Time for regulators to come together and reach consensus.\nDespite these open questions Germany has taken a huge and bold step. It will be very exciting to see how other financial centres like London, Switzerland, Singapore and the US now position themselves.", "year": 2013, "month": 8, "day": 19}

After that, the conference will formally end, but there will also be an optional discussion on lobbying and self-regulatory strategies.\nThis conference is notable because it shows well the effort that big Bitcoin businesses are taking to integrate themselves into the mainstream, and the mainstream\u2019s willingness to take them seriously. This is a conference that, despite attempts to frame it around a wider issue of \u201cvirtual currencies\u201d, is essentially about Bitcoin, and major players from the financial industry and self-regulatory and government regulatory agencies are seeing it fit to take the time to speak to this audience. Some may argue that the government\u2019s wheels have simply only started to turn, and we will see much more active attempts to suppress Bitcoin in the years to come, but for the time being relationships between the US Bitcoin business community and government regulators appear to be surprisingly positive \u2013 a state of affairs that those in organizations like DATA are striving hard to maintain.\nBrian Santos is offering extended early bird pricing, allowing anyone who wishes to attend to buy a ticket to the conference for $295 \u2013 paying bitcoins if necessary.

Unfortunately the definition of heroism necessarily implies that their actions are heroic because they are unusual. Their actions surprised us because most companies, when faced between choosing between continued operation and honoring the trust their users have given them, toss integrity aside.\nEven though Levinson was speaking in the context of communication providers, his words apply equally well to Bitcoin. A police state is no less interested in controlling the flows of money between its subjects than it is in monitoring and controlling the flows of communication.\n2013 was a great and terrible year for US Bitcoin companies. Several high profile companies received significant venture backing, which is good insofar as a recognition of their success and growth potential. However this also puts them in a hostage situation.\nThe investors backing these companies naturally want to not only receive a return on their investment, but to have the principle itself returned. This natural desire to get their money back serves as an effective means of control over them by bureaucrats who are capable of using their legal power to make the value of those investments evaporate on a whim. Because of this risk and others, venture capitalists normally insist on gaining significant control over the companies they invest in. This means that you should expect that when the US government says, \u201cjump\u201d, every venture-funded Bitcoin company will reply, \u201chow high?\u201d Hoping they will all have the courage of Lavabit is unrealistic.\nFrom its inception, Bitcoin was destined to come into conflict with laws and regulators in the same way P2P file sharing did, and from its inception some people respond to Bitcoin\u2019s potential by suggesting that it be changed to make it more compatible with the systems of legal control it was designed to evade.\nSome of the proposals which have been suggested in the past include: adding the capability to reverse transactions, confiscation of balances, creating a central authority that can whitelist and/or blacklist addresses, and requiring all users to register their wallets with a government agency. So far none of these have been implemented into the protocol but the pressure to do so is will only continue to increase, especially by venture-funded companies, especially in the USA.\nUltimately it will be up to the international Bitcoin community to resist these pressures. The US government has a long reach, but non-US Bitcoin users have the ability to operate beyond it if they choose to develop that capability. It would be an enormously positive sign for Bitcoin if communities in Europe, Russia, China, and Latin America started their own development initiatives.\nBits of Proof and btcd are positive steps towards making the Bitcoin protocol resistant to arbitrary change by a small group. The best possible outcome for the network is to be composed of heterogeneous nodes, consisting of independent implementations which only implement protocol changes via a standardization process which involves near-universal consensus.\nThe single best step the global Bitcoin community could take to ensure this outcome is to create and fund projects that implement alternate Bitcoin implementations in a manner independent of any US person, company, or organization.\nBitcoin promises to be a neutral and international monetary standard, which provides a level playing field for participants all over the world. In order to realize this potential, it must be protected from the controlling influences of any single government, even if this causes some short term difficulty for Bitcoin users and companies under the control of one of those governments. It\u2019s time for users around the world to step up and make sure not all their Bitcoin eggs are trapped in the US basket.", "year": 2013, "month": 8, "day": 16}
{"title": "Bitcoin Nordic: Buy CashU Vouchers with Bitcoins", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-nordic-buy-cashu-vouchers-with-bitcoins-1376514060/", "birthday": "Aug 14, 2013  5:01 PM EST", "date": "2013-08-14 22:01:00", "content": "Bitcoin Nordic\u2019s Lasse Birk Olesen has announced that the company is now offering a way for Bitcoin users to purchase CashU coupons, an online payment mechanism accepted at hundreds of online locations including iTunes, Amazon, Skype and Xbox Live. CashU coupons are offered in denominations of $10, $30, $50, $100 and $300, and are set to the buyer\u2019s email address within 24 hours of purchase.\nFrom the average Bitcoin user\u2019s perspective, the fees are high; Bitcoin Nordic charges a transaction fee of 10% on every purchase. Thus, the service is not likely to be significantly used by anyone with the option of simply paying for iTunes or Amazon products with a credit card; among the North American and European Bitcoin communities, its only users are likely to be those Bitcoin users that have Bitcoin-paying jobs and almost no fiat currency income at all. However, there is one place where the service is likely to be of great value: North Africa and the Middle East. In North Africa and the Middle East, many people do not have credit cards, and a considerable number do not even have bank accounts, and CashU has become an extremely popular alternative. However, that is not because of its low fees; for purchasing CashU vouchers with a credit card, for example, CashU charges 5% in addition to an implicit fee from currency conversion on the part of your bank. Other purchase mechanisms, like Fawry and Ukash, have even higher fees, in some cases up to 9%. Thus, compared to these alternatives, Bitcoin Nordic\u2019s fee is only slightly higher, and Olesen intends to lower it over there is enough volume to do so.\nBut ultimately even a 10% fee does not matter all that much, because the combination of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Nordic\u2019s service provides North African and Middle Eastern residents with a unique service that no other payment system comes close to offering: access to the North American and European online labor markets. Using Bitcoin, writers, graphic designers, developers and translators in North Africa or the Middle East can earn relatively high salaries doing freelance work for various individuals and businesses in the United States, Canada and the EU, and with Bitcoin Nordic\u2019s service they can quickly convert the money into a form that they can immediately spend on their own needs. Normally, under such circumstances PayPal comes to mind, but in this case PayPal proves to be of very limited value; the reason is that PayPal transactions are reversible, whereas CashU transactions are irreversible, preventing CashU from accepting PayPal as a funding option \u2013 if it did, fraudulent buyers would purchase CashU units with PayPal, quickly spend them on goods, and then cancel the PayPal transaction. UKash is also irreversible and international, so it is CashU compatible, but it suffers from high fees and obscurity; as mentioned above, conversion fees are over 9%, and right now, at least according to Google Trends, Bitcoin appears to be about five times as popular as UKash is.\nSituations like these are perfect examples of where Bitcoin can truly shine. Even in environments where banking infrastructure is scant or nonexistent, the economy is often ravaged by political turmoil or war, and financial institutions from Europe or the US see no profit (or too much risk) in participating, as long as someone, somewhere can put up an internet connection everyone is potentially within reach of help. When making one of the three first ever large-scale \u201cmassive open online courses\u201d in late 2011, Stanford University professor Sebastian Thrun received the following email from one of his students in Afghanistan:\nI spent the last few days under incoming mortar and rocket attacks, then dodging checkpoints under questionable legal status to exfiltrate a war zone to a third world air field until things settled down. I had about an hour of fairly solid internet connectivity to be able to get the assignments done, and still managed a respectable score. This is a typical week here for me.\nDespite the cultural barriers, despite the hardship and despite the war, stories like these show the sheer determination and will of the local people to lift themselves out of their predicament \u2013 and in this case, the internet allowed a university professor in California to help this man take one step toward perhaps, eventually, actually doing so. Now, imagine this man getting a programming job with bitcoins, and eventually buying his family plane tickets out to Europe. At least one Arabian airline accepts CashU; if Udacity succeeded in inspiring the student to further develop his programming talents to a reasonable level, it would not even be particularly hard.\nThe above is certainly not meant to promote the unfortunate stereotype that the Middle East and North Africa are in their entirety war-torn hellholes; in reality, most of the countries in the region are fairly mundane and stable places, suffering mainly from lack of infrastructure and development and perhaps a moderate level of political oppression. In those environments, Bitcoin and CashU also play a massive role in providing a form of \u201cbanking for the unbanked\u201d. Anyone earning bitcoins can use BitStamp as an ad-hoc bank account, converting out to CashU coupons when needed, and even this setup provides much more financial safety than, for example, holding large quantities of cash. In harsher environments, however, Bitcoin becomes even more necessary, and this fast and easy cashout method has just made using Bitcoin much more practical.", "year": 2013, "month": 8, "day": 14}

Ideally, Members of Congress and the US Senate will take a closer and more holistic look into how regulators have been handling Bitcoin and will proceed with regulations or lack thereof. While, it would be even more ideal for Bitcoin to have more time to flourish prior to catching the eye of Congress, the Bitcoin community now has a golden opportunity to rise to the occasion and share the truth on the merits, value and utility of Bitcoin, not just as an international currency but also as a symbol of freedom of speech.\nThe US Senate is now looking to rein in regulators to ensure that Congress has a full understanding of Bitcoin and additional digital cryptocurrencies prior to any further regulation. On the heels of Senator Chuck Schumer\u2019s (D-NY) statement in 2011 that Bitcoin is an \u201conline form of money laundering,\u201d members of the US Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee would like to clarify the purposes for and utility of Bitcoin through issuing a report on digital currency. Members of the committee sent letters to several executive agencies requesting disclosure of their virtual currency policies, how these policies have been developed and plans moving forward. As Senator Schumer may be preparing to take on digital currencies including Bitcoin again, some Members of Congress and Senators are working to learn more about this digital, decentralized cryptocurrency prior to any further talk of regulations.\nThe US Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee\u2019s proactive step can be viewed in a positive light. One promising quote from the committee\u2019s letter reads, \u201cas with all emerging technologies, the federal government must make sure that potential threats and risks are dealt with swiftly\u2026However, we must also ensure that rash or uninformed actions don\u2019t stifle a potentially valuable technology.\u201d US House and Senate staff members are coming to grips that they may be behind the eight ball in terms of learning about tech friendly issues and advancements before it is too late. After the New York Financial Services Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky sent out subpoenas to 22 Bitcoin related businesses and voiced consideration of further regulations, Members of the US House, Senate and Congressional Staff see a clear need to learn about Bitcoin, a digital currency that has caught the eye of money and now sits at a price of 106 USD/BTC.\nIt is key for Members of the Bitcoin Community to highlight the US Congress\u2019s choice in the past to give up attempting to crack down on e-commerce and how as a result online businesses have flourished and benefitted not only the US economy but global community. What if Congress had cracked down on development of the internet, e-commerce, etc back in the early 2000\u2019s? Well, you most likely would not be reading this article on your smart phone and Members of Congress, Senators and staff would certainly not be able to follow up to the minute votes and legislative action on their blackberries. This truth must come out. The success of the Bitcoin currency today is just a glimpse of what is to come in terms of expediency and economic growth around the world. Bitcoin Magazine encourages you to learn more about the stand your government is taking towards Bitcoin and the concept of a digital, decentralized, cryptocurrency and from there learn the positions of your local, state and national leaders. It takes one individual to share the validity of the Bitcoin currency and from there open the door to constructive dialogue.", "year": 2013, "month": 8, "day": 13}

Right on the top of the list of the most tech-oriented nations, India will take a leap forward should the Reserve Bank of India truly take a hands off approach towards the Bitcoin currency. As the Indian Rupee is calling for attention with higher rates of inflation, the Reserve Bank of India has voiced intentions of increasing the value of the Rupee and just keeping an eye on Bitcoin.\nWith a hands off approach, the Reserve Bank of India, has provided more time for the Bitcoin community in India to advance and expand before any concrete guidelines are put in place. The Bitcoin community in India can use this gift of time to develop Bitcoin related businesses in the space and also educate Indian citizens on the many opportunities for economic growth associated with Bitcoin. Should the Indian government impose guidelines down the road, the Bitcoin community will be prepared.\nIn the US, the Bitcoin community is experiencing a different narrative. Early this week, the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee sent a letter to various executive agencies seeking more insight on the procedures, plans and policies already in place for regulating the Bitcoin currency. Bitcoin businesses in the US have less time to advance in a deregulated space. Fortunately to date, the US Senate is seeking clarity and not further regulations, but time is now of essence for the Bitcoin community in the US to safeguard against potential restrictions down the road.\nWhile Bitcoin has continued to grow in prominence since 2009, the Indian government and in particular the Reserve Bank of India, RBI, would like to wait before putting in place any guidelines related to the currency.

{"title": "Bitcoin and China: More than Meets the Eye?", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-and-china-more-than-meets-the-eye-1376954038/", "birthday": "Aug 19, 2013  7:13 PM EST", "date": "2013-08-20 00:13:00", "content": "This article is not the first time that I have covered the Chinese Bitcoin economy. Four months ago, China saw its first major interaction with the Bitcoin community when the One Foundation, the largest independent charity in China, started accepting Bitcoin donations for a disaster relief campaign, and received 230 BTC (then $30,000) within two days. Two weeks after that, China became the first country to overtake the US in BitcoinQt client downloads, and keeps a position of second place to this day. China also has an online discount store accepting bitcoins, a high level of Bitcoin activity on Taobao, the local equivalent of Ebay, and a large number of users eager to take up Bitcoin having already gone through the virtual currency experience with Q Coin in 2007. Most interestingly of all, however, was a half-hour broadcast on China Central television, a station described by Wikipedia as the \u201cpredominant state television broadcaster in mainland China\u201d. Since then, the Chinese government has made no moves whatsoever with regard to Bitcoin. At first, the likely explanation of this was simple: the Chinese Communist Party is a complex beast, and the culture and entertainment-focused parts of it can easily have an attitude of curiosity and even excitement about Bitcoin while the more conservative, state security-focused parts of the party simply haven\u2019t woken up yet. However, with every passing month that the Chinese government simply sits around and does nothing, even while the central bank of Thailand, a longtime political ally of China, recommends that Bitcoin be banned, that hypothesis gets slightly less likely, and an alternative possibility comes into play: Bitcoin might be becoming China\u2019s newest special economic zone.\nChina\u2019s special economic zone (SEZ) program was first created in the early 1980s as part of China\u2019s economic modernization initiative, creating specific locations with business-friendly policies in order to attract foreign investment, as well as experiment with different ways of increasing economic freedom so as to determine which policies would be best to expand to China as a whole. By focusing foreign investment into a few parts of the country, the scheme also satisfies the more conservative members of the Chinese government, allowing China to benefit from large quantities of foreign investment and expertise while still keeping the bulk of the population under the firm grip of authoritarian rule. This balancing act \u2013 being free, and advertising its freedom, in ways that are useful to the government without actually being free in general, has been a core part of Chinese government policy for the past three decades, and many of the government\u2019s various initiatives, ranging from the Democracy Wall to the Hundred Flowers campaign in the late 1950s to the special economic zones themselves, can be viewed as being facets of it.\nNow, the question is, how does Bitcoin fit into this picture? First of all, just like a special economic zone, the Bitcoin economy is currently small and highly self-contained. The total value of all bitcoins in circulation currently stands at about $1.1 billion, making the Bitcoin economy of the entire world smaller than many cities. Many Bitcoin spenders are also Bitcoin earners, partially because of the community aspect and partially because decoupling from the fiat economy for many hops at a time is often the only way that the cost savings of Bitcoin can be truly realized. Bitcoin users are also a self-selecting, and highly technically skilled, audience, and understand the risks of dealing with untested markets and technologies better than the average person. Thus, for China, encouraging the growth of Bitcoin business is an opportunity to tread the waters with increased economic freedom without compromising its social and economic regulatory structure as a whole. If Bitcoin gets too big, the Chinese government can always strike it down in one fell swoop with a government edict, much like it did with the Democracy Wall and Tiananmen Square.\nSecond, Bitcoin has the potential to become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre of the civil liberties front. When the US government ordered DEFCAD to take down the files for their 3D printed gun three months ago, the internet community was up in arms, seeing the link between DEFCAD\u2019s right to tell people how to make 3D printed weapons with the general ideal of freedom of information. Given the right public relations spin, US governmental persecution of Bitcoin can easily be made to elicit the same response. More recently, Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations regarding the National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance activities have become a source of ammunition for the Chinese government itself; two months ago the overseas edition of the People\u2019s Daily, the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s official newspaper, strongly rebuked the US government for its actions, saying that \u201cin a sense, the United States has gone from a \u2018model of human rights\u2019 to \u2018an eavesdropper on personal privacy\u2019, the \u2018manipulator\u2019 of the centralised power over the international internet, and the mad \u2018invader\u2019 of other countries\u2019 networks\u201d, and the Global Times, owned by the People\u2019s Daily, praised Edward Snowden as \u201ca young idealist who has exposed the sinister scandals of the US government\u201d. Of course, this is by every means a case of \u201cthe pot calling the kettle black\u201d; less than two months later the People\u2019s Daily called for \u201crestraint in online speech\u201c, and in general censorship and surveillance in China remains rampant. However, anything that allows the Chinese government to honestly say \u201cwe\u2019re better than the United States\u201d, no matter how small, represents an opportunity to frame the debate in China\u2019s favor and improve the country\u2019s highly authoritarian reputation.\nThird, China has an established, and government-supported, culture of establishing local alternatives to foreign businesses. Replacing Ebay, China has Taobao, replacing Paypal there is Alipay, replacing Google there is Baidu, and taking Google\u2019s role of the \u201cmain internet corporation\u201d is Tencent. The main reason for doing this is national security; by having key internet infrastructure locally controlled, the Chinese Communist Party gains increased control over its citizens\u2019 online interaction and, perhaps more importantly, strongly limits the control of the United States. With the revelations around Edward Snowden, this argument just got a whole lot more powerful. However, just because the Chinese government wants technological independence, that does not mean that it is guaranteed to succeed. In the international sphere credit cards and Paypal are much more powerful and, lacking government intervention or fundamentally new alternatives, may well come to take over the rest of the world \u2013 leaving China the choice of either submitting to the US financial sector or subjecting its citizens to economic isolation. This is a situation that the Chinese government is desperate to avoid in general; notice its repeated efforts to trade with other countries without the US dollar. Arguably, Bitcoin is precisely the fundamentally new alternative that China needs; because it is politically neutral and international, it would be much easier to get India, Africa and the Middle East onboard, and China can still choose to eventually exercise a high degree of control over local Bitcoin exchanges once they are in place if it feels the need to increase regulation. At this point, the chance that Bitcoin will become anything like that remains slim. But, as part of a shotgun strategy of trying many things and seeing what works, supporting Bitcoin can be a very solid bet.\nWe know that the Chinese government certainly can heed the above arguments and continue to be a Bitcoin-friendly regime. The question is, will it? So far, there is still almost no evidence that the Chinese government actually intends to be lax on Bitcoin in the future, or that any high-level officials actually have any of the above ideas in mind. However, there are reasons to be optimistic. The Economist described China\u2019s new cadre of economic officials selected in 2013 as \u201cencouragingly long on reformers and short on ideologues\u201d, suggesting the possibility of a further sea change in the Communist Party\u2019s economic policies. As far as civil liberties go, China is still far from catching up to the Western world (and the Western world is, despite the NSA, still quite far from catching down to China), but on the economic front the situation is quite positive. In the past, China was able to attract business with low wages, but in the last ten years Chinese wages have been rising over 10% year over year, and the \u201ccopycat economy\u201d of delivering low-cost functional lookalikes of Western-made products is nearing its limits. If the Chinese government intends to steer the country toward being an effective post-industrial economy, then offering increased economic freedom and, particularly importantly, a pro-innovation environment, is the way to go. Perhaps there is indeed an \u201cavant garde\u201d in the Chinese government, which sees Bitcoin as a place to make one of its first moves. Or, perhaps, China\u2019s Bitcoin-friendliness is still simply the result of government blindness, and a crackdown is due to come in two or four months. We don\u2019t know. But with every passing week the alternative hypothesis is becoming increasingly likely; perhaps China\u2019s Bitcoin acceptance has more behind it than meets the eye.", "year": 2013, "month": 8, "day": 20}

The restaurant\u2019s owner, Joerg Platzer, first started accepting Bitcoin in 2011, just before the peak of the first bubble in June. Several news sources in the local media reported on the event, showing customers paying around 0.5 BTC for a burger. Like all other Bitcoin-related businesses, Room77 faded somewhat in prominence as the 2011 bubble collapsed, but the restaurant kept going, and at the end of 2012 Platzer started the Bitcoin Kiez, a campaign to expand Bitcoin\u2019s presence in the city to beyond just the one restaurant. In November, Platzer announced two new businesses accepting Bitcoin, by December the figure was up to six, and now, after seven months of continued expansion in 2013, the total count on the semi-official bitcoinkiez.de map stands at 17.\n\nIt is important to point out that the picture of the Bitcoin Kiez in Berlin is not quite so rosy as some of its more fervent enthusiasts claim. The media hype around the area can easily lead one to have the impression that the neighborhood around Room77 is plastered with Bitcoin-accepting businesses almost one after the other, and Bitcoin is \u201cas easy to use as cash\u201c. In reality, however, even in the heart of the Kiez around Room77 one needs to look hard to find the other Bitcoin businesses around. Having nine businesses all within several hundred meters of each other may seem like a lot on paper, but given that there are several hundred fiat-only businesses within three hundred meters of Room77, it ends up appearing somewhat underwhelming when one actually goes there. The other nine Bitcoin-accepting locations in Berlin are scattered around the city; you need to make a specific effort to find and go to each one. That said, however, the success of the Bitcoin Kiez in Berlin should not be understated; there is no other city in the world with even ten Bitcoin-accepting locations, with second place perhaps going to San Francisco with around five. Berlin is thus pretty much the only city in the world where one can live entirely on Bitcoin without relying on an established support network, and enjoy the experience. The city has restaurants accepting Bitcoin, a tour guide, places to live through either 9flats or unterkunft.de and a thriving Bitcoin and hacker scene. And things are only going to get better.\n\nFor a more detailed look at Bitcoin in Berlin, be sure to look out for the upcoming issue 13 of our magazine. Additionally, Solene and Lorenza from the European Bitcoin community have provided a large number of pictures from the Bitcoin meetups:\nhttps://plus.google.com/photos/115742856189848313825/albums/5915281564744665713?authkey=CIXYgrzfnful-wEhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/w7f5ee2i6tymyf4/hlrQxoUgbQ#/", "year": 2013, "month": 8, "day": 23}
{"title": "BTCTrip: Travel the World with Global Currency", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/btctrip-travel-the-world-with-global-currency-1377017188/", "birthday": "Aug 20, 2013  12:46 PM EST", "date": "2013-08-20 17:46:00", "content": "In the past year, travel has become a mainstay of the Bitcoin economy. There are currently dozens of hostels and hotels accepting Bitcoin around the world, even including a hostel in the middle of the Guatemalan rainforest. For those who do not like hotels, Airbnb alternative 9flats, a service that allows homeowners to easily rent out their rooms to short-term travellers, has been accepting bitcoins since April. Bitcoin ATMs let people buy bitcoins in person whenever they need, and bi-directional ATMs will soon allow people to travel the world with nothing but Bitcoin and cash out into whatever local currency they need upon arrival. An increasingly large number of Bitcoin conferences provide a reason for people to travel and come together from around the country \u2013 or even around the world. All that was left is a way of buying plane tickets for bitcoins. Now, Martin Fernandez has come up with : BTCTrip.\nFernandez is, in many ways, the archetypal Bitcoin user. He had met original Linux developer Linus Torvalds and PGP creator Phil Zimmermann in the 1990s, and distinctly remembers Torvalds giving him a CD containing the first version of Slackware Linux in a meetup in 1998. \u201cI was deep into this culture that all information had to be free,\u201d Fernandez relates. He then proceeded to take up IT security as a career in 2004, and prospered for several years \u2013 until the 2007 economic crash hit. \u201cIt destroyed me completely,\u201d Fernandez recalls. \u201cI had to close my offices. I left the business scene for a couple of years completely, and I started to go into movies and use technology for the performing arts. [Several years later] I started teaching in Buenos Aires and working with technology again, and I was waiting for the one event that would drive me to come back. Then, I heard about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.\u201d\nExcited about the project\u2019s potential, Fernandez sent out emails to Phil Zimmermann and his other friends from the security community, and the responses he got were overwhelmingly positive. From there, Fernandez\u2019s new career was set. All that was left was to figure out what it was that he could actually do for the Bitcoin community. Fernandez continues: \u201cI called a designer friend, who is a crazy girl and makes flyers for electronics, and I said to her: Cassandra, design me a website for tickets, but we don\u2019t want to just sell tickets, we want to sell the experience. Think of a programmer in Silicon Valley who just wants to take a break.\u201d And so BTCTrip was born. The idea caught on quickly, with BitInstant founder Charlie Shrem becoming one of its earliest and loudest supporters, and many prominent Bitcoin users, including a number of Bitcoin Foundation members, quickly became BTCTrip customers.\nBTCTrip functions similarly to other plane ticket selling intermediaries, like Skyscanner and Expedia. Users enter the city they want to fly from and fly to, their desired departure date (and arrival date for return trips) and optionally their tolerance for discomforts like stopovers and long flights, and BTCTrip scans through all major providers to figure out what the cheapest options are. The user then selects one of the routes, and is directed to a form where they can fill in their name, date of birth and email address, and then pay for the order with bitcoins. Once BTCTrip processes the order, the user receives the flight confirmation by email, and can either check in online at the company\u2019s website or wait to check in at the airport.\nWhere BTCTrip truly shines, however, is in its prices. Most intermediary services that allow users to purchase products from the fiat currency economy with bitcoins by proxy work by charging a small percentage fee, so the services are actually more expensive than simply paying with one\u2019s credit card directly. For this reason, most such services so far have seen little volume; their main customers are those whose primary income is in bitcoins, and so for whom it is converting from Bitcoin to fiat currency, rather than the other way around, that is the primary difficulty. BTCTrip, on the other hand, is often actually cheaper than its competition, charging buyers up to 5-10% less than what the ticket costs with a credit card. Most of the time intermediaries do this, it is either a marketing gimmick to attract more customers or a charity effort to support the Bitcoin community; not so with BTCTrip. Although Fernandez is unwilling to reveal the details of how his service does this, BTCTrip uses the bitcoins it receives from customers to provide liquidity for some kind of multi-currency arbitrage, exploiting inefficiencies in various Bitcoin and fiat currency exchange markets to earn a profit. \u201cWe are breaking even now,\u201d Fernandez reports.\nIn practice, not all flights are cheaper on BTCTrip; sometimes, Skyscanner and Expedia provide significantly better options, and in one deliberately pathological test case of flying from Iqaluit, Canada to Auckland, New Zealand, BTCTrip\u2019s offer of 8,200 USD was roughly triple the 1,970 EUR (2,630 USD) given by Expedia \u2013 although, in that particular case, switching the departure date from Aug 24 to Aug 25 brought BTCTrip\u2019s offer down to $2,470 compared to Expedia\u2019s $2,640. However, for those cases where BTCTrip\u2019s search engine simply can\u2019t win, there is still a way out: at the top of the results window, the site features a banner making a offer popular with discount vendors: \u201cFound it cheaper somewhere? We can beat any offer.\u201d And it\u2019s true; you need only click the \u201cBuy Now\u201d button, and fill in a form containing their name, email and a link to the better offer, and within hours BTCTrip will send you an email offering the better deal \u2013 with a 5% discount applied. BTCTrip\u2019s customer service is excellent, politely, professionally and, perhaps most importantly, quickly responding to travellers\u2019 concerns or special needs.\nLooking Further\nUltimately, BTCTrip\u2019s mission extends far beyond simply offering flights for bitcoins; for Fernandez, the project is fundamentally about the community. The company does not purchase any advertising, relying entirely on word of mouth to get new customers, and places a heavy emphasis on public relations initiatives to support this strategy. BTCTrip has offered free tickets for Edward Snowden to use in Russia, and for free software advocate Richard Stallman to use in international travels. To support Bitcoin itself, Fernandez is actively trying to get Bitcoin accepted in Cuba, and BTCTrip frequently sells bitcoins to the Argentinian community, where most of the service\u2019s employees are based. \u201cThese kinds of things are important to us,\u201d Fernandez says. \u201cOur business is based on community and trust in the community\u201d\nThe two core pillars of BTCTrip \u2013 selling not flights but experience, and integrating with the community, will continue to serve as the basis of the company as it expands. Recently, BTCTrip announced that it intends to launch three new services: Rent a Car and Hotel (self-explanatory), BTCTrip Miles and Points, a rewards program for regular customers, and BTCTrip Surfing, a program targeted toward travelers attending international events like concerts, raves, social forums, hacker and tech conferences and, of course, Bitcoin events. After that, Fernandez has another service in mind: Couchsurfing for Bitcoin users. Couchsurfing is a site where travellers can find local people to stay with for the duration of their journeys, avoiding the need to pay for expensive hotels. The two most popular alternatives, Airbnb and 9Flats are hybrids between Couchsurfing and traditional rental, allowing hosts to collect a daily or monthly fee, and 9Flats has accepted bitcoins since April. An equivalent that was Bitcoin-only would work specifically to bring together Bitcoin users, giving visitors not just a place to stay but also at least one person with a common interest to talk about. Between Bitcoin flights, Bitcoin hotels and couchsurfing, and an increasing number of local Bitcoin restaurants, the nomad Bitcoiner has everything that they need to survive \u2013 although more Bitcoin grocery stores would certainly help cut down food costs from eating at restaurants three times a day.\nFinally, BTCTrip might be planning a Bitcoin event of their own, to take place in Argentina. Argentina has seen a large growth in its local Bitcoin community because of the local government\u2019s frequent economic mismanagement; the country last went bankrupt in 2001, and is currently experiencing inflation rates of around 30-50%, depending on which exchange rate one believes. \u201cArgentinians know very well about the problems of banks,\u201d Fernandez explains, \u201cand they don\u2019t trust banks, even American banks.\u201d Capital controls, high taxes, and a government that often wastes the tax money that it receives provider a further impetus for Bitcoin adoption. Finally, Fernandez explains, \u201cArgentinians like new social and economic movements\u201d in general. And the Argentinian Bitcoin economy is more than just talk; on Mercado Libre, a South America-focused equivalent of Craigslist, many people publish products and services for sale for bitcoins, and a significant number of Bitcoin trades actually take place. \u201cI think interest in Bitcoin will increase and increase here,\u201d Fernandez believes.\nWatch out for more updates from BTCTrip about the potential conference and their upcoming services in the months to come.", "year": 2013, "month": 8, "day": 20}

Australia, and the Netherlands simply said that Bitcoin is taxable, India states that it has no intent to regulate Bitcoin exchanges under local money transmission law, Canada and Great Britain did both, Norway and Sweden warned against it but did little else, Finland simply said that Bitcoin is legal, and France and China gave it their tacit approval, and Thailand took the opposite track, suggesting (but certainly not conclusively ruling) that it might be illegal outright. Finally, in the United States, the response has been truly massive. Over the last twelve months, the country has seen a combination of pretty much every regulatory opinion on Bitcoin that could be made, with at least ten separate state and federal government agencies weighing in in some fashion. The list is growing almost every week, but here are the current top ten:\nThe New Hampshire Deputy Secretary of State formally approved New Hampshire State Representative Mark Warden's acceptance of bitcoins for political contributions.The New Hampshire Securities Bureau stated that they do not intend to regulate Bitcoin for the time being, as \"it is not money and therefore it does not meet the investment contract analysis.\"A judge in Texas denied Trendon Shavers' defense that the Securities and Exchange Commission has no authority to investigate his Ponzi scheme because \"Bitcoin is not money\", claiming that Bitcoin certainly is money. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has issued a guidance report in March 2013 explaining the regulatory status of Bitcoin exchanges. This guidance established that ordinary Bitcoin businesses are not affected by money transmission law, but exchanges are, and so require federal and state money transmitter licenses along with the requisite $7 million in surety bonds (costing about $100,000 per year). FinCEN officials have proceeded to make multiple comments on Bitcoin since then.California's Department of Financial Institutions sent a cease and desist letter to the Bitcoin Foundation, telling it to \"cease and desist from the business of conducting money transmission in this state\" but explaining little else. The Bitcoin Foundation has since replied.The House of Representatives released an appropriations bill detailing the budgets of various government agencies. The bill included a \"rider\" (a general term) for a provision hidden inside a bill with little relation to the content of the rest of the bill) asking the FBI \"to provide a briefing no later 120 days after the enactment of this Act on the nature and scale of the risk posed by such ersatz currency, both in financing illegal enterprises and in undermining financial institutions.\"A Senate committee instructed the Department of Homeland Security to provide \"any policies, procedures, guidance or advisories related to the treatment or regulation of virtual currencies\", citing concerns that \"[Bitcoin's] near-anonymous and decentralized nature has also attracted criminals who value few things more than being allowed to operate in the shadows\".Bitcoin exchange MtGox saw its US bank account frozen by the Department of Homeland Security, which argued that, when processing deposits and withdrawals, MtGox was moving USD between Dwolla accounts and its own MtGox accounts, and this constituted unlicensed money transmission. Note that, contrary to popular opinion, Bitcoin was not strictly involved here.The Government Accountability Office published a report describing under what circumstances virtual currency transactions are taxable, and recommends the IRS to help educate taxpayers about virtual currency taxation. However, the report writes, \"Given [the] uncertainty, available funding, and other priorities, IRS made a reasoned decision not to implement a compliance approach specific to virtual economies and currencies.\"New York's Department of Financial Services subpoenaed 22 Bitcoin businesses, in an attempt to gather information on Bitcoin business and see if the DFS should create new relations specifically tailored to the Bitcoin economy.\nMuch of the attention on Bitcoin has simply been inquisitive, trying to figure out what dangers Bitcoin poses with regard to crime and money laundering. In general, however, the attention on Bitcoin is much more hostile in the United States than elsewhere, not only in terms of the laws that have been passed but also in lawmakers' rhetoric, actively creating an utterly unnecessary state of fear in the Bitcoin world. This ranges from the FinCEN paper's comments that irreversible payments are the territory of criminals, the FBI and Senate committe's focus on Bitcoin's potential to promote crime, and the CFTC's almost threatening words that the agency \"could regulate Bitcoin if we wanted\". In Europe, Norway and Sweden have warned against Bitcoin, citing consumer protection and crime concerns, but every other government that has weighed in on Bitcoin has, by and large, simply stated that it is legal. The one exception is arguably Germany. In Germany, we have seen three regulatory moves on Bitcoin:\nIn December 2011, German financial regulator BaFin wrote a report stating that they do not consider Bitcoin to be \"electronic money\", treating it as a \"unit of value\" and in some cases a \"unit of account\". As Stefan Greiner described it, \"[BaFin's wording] states that the \u201ccreation\u201d of bitcoins and their \u201cuse as medium of payment\u201d do not need a permit (license). However, regulation applicable to banks and financial services could be applicable to Bitcoin transactions under two conditions: (1) the bitcoins themselves become an \u201cobject of trade\u201d and (2) the \u201cstructure of the transaction\u201d justifies doing so. If these two criteria are met, bitcoins become \u201cunits of account\u201d and therefore \u201cby implication\u201d financial instruments.\"In June 2013, German FDP party member Frank Sch\u00e4ffler made a parliamentary inquiry asking the government for an opinion on Bitcoin's tax status. The response: if the time between when bitcoins are bought and sold is longer than one year, then the owner does not need to pay capital gains tax on any earnings from Bitcoin rising in price during that period. However, the reply did not touch upon the subject of sales tax.Another inquiry by Frank Sch\u00e4ffler brings further clarity to Bitcoin regulation in Germany: Bitcoin is now private money. As a result of this, the act of selling bitcoins is taxable, but only if the sale is part of a business transaction. The requirements for a Bitcoin sale to count as a business transaction \"are extremely high\"; the key criterion is that one must be trading bitcoins not just for oneself, but also for other people. Additionally, new requirements for Bitcoin trading businesses come into play; among the most onerous are the requirement to have 730,000 EUR in initial capital and \"professionally qualified management\"\nThe last rule is tough, and certainly Bitcoin businesses would find Great Britain's stance that Bitcoin exchanges will fall under no special regulation vastly preferable. However, even here, we see only three regulatory moves toward Bitcoin (or four if one counts the European Central Bank report from 2012) compared to the United States' ten. Furthermore, every single action that the government took was toward further clarifying Bitcoin's status and explaining what the rules are; there have been no one-off cease and desist letters or politicians inculcating a state of regulatory fear. Of course, Germany is much smaller than the United States, and its government less complex; in fact, many would argue that the appropriate comparison is not between the US and Germany, but between the US and the European Union - and in the EU, there have been even more than ten regulatory actions on Bitcoin so far. However, the European Union does not require businesses to get money transmitter licenses in all 27 member states - German businesses worry about German regulations, UK businesses worry about UK regulations, and the same for every other country. In the United States, every business must worry about every state's regulations, in addition to half a dozen redundant regulatory agencies on the federal level.\nWhat all of this says is that the quality of US regulatory agencies is poor, and that we can do better. Regulatory interaction in the US should not simply be limited to accepting existing laws and being in \"compliance\" with them, or even acting defensively to prevent further regulations in the years to come. Additionally, the United States can benefit greatly from a concerted political effort to attack the regulatory maze head on, and help improve the situation not just for Bitcoin, but for the digital payments industry as a whole. One model initiative in this regard is a Bitcoin primer for policymakers released by George Mason University, and another example is the Bitcoin Foundation's two excellent letters to California's Department of Financial Institutions and FinCEN. Yes, the US government is scary, and if the Bitcoin community plays its cards wrong much stricter regulations may be soon to come. However, the Bitcoin community must also not be excessively meek. A widely understood concept in political discourse is the Overton Window - the idea that there is always an \"accepted\" range of political discourse, and most people are naturally driven to compromise and find positions in the middle of the window. Thus, the role of extremists is to widen the window in one direction, so as to ultimately push the center. The Bitcoin community needs to be proactive, and start framing the discussion and setting the Overton window in favorable terms; the battle should be over the absurdity of requiring forty seven licenses to start a business, not over whether Bitcoin should be legal or not.\nBy targeting this aspect of regulation, the Bitcoin community can get plenty of business interests on its side, as money transmitter law is not the only kind of law that operates in this way. Self-regulatory organizations like DATA are another excellent idea, also because they allow the Bitcoin Foundation a way to step out of the role of being a regulatory compliance group to representing all sides of the Bitcoin community - including those who would prefer not to deal with regulators at all. Now is the right time to take this stance. Edward Snowden's revelations have started to create a sea change in Americans' opinion on the importance of safety and surveillance versus freedom and privacy, making increased restrictionism considerably easier to fight against. The quicker Bitcoin can be accepted as just another part of the internet, and not something new and scary, the better; hopefully, in time the idea of requiring forty seven licenses and millions of dollars in surety bonds will appear to everyone as absurd as the idea of regulating torrent networks seems to us today.

{"title": "Critical Vulnerability Found In Android Wallets", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/critical-vulnerability-found-in-android-wallets-1376273924/", "birthday": "Aug 11, 2013  10:18 PM EST", "date": "2013-08-12 03:18:00", "content": "A critical security vulnerability has been found in Android which renders bitcoins stored in Android Bitcoin wallets vulnerable to theft, and the exploit is currently being used in the wild to steal people\u2019s bitcoins. Several people have reported that their Android wallets were cleared out and the funds sent to 1HKywxiL4JziqXrzLKhmB6a74ma6kxbSDj, an address which currently contains 55.8 BTC. Because the bug is a flaw in Android itself, all Android Bitcoin wallets are vulnerable; Bitcoin Wallet for Android, Bitcoin Spinner, the mobile version of blockchain.info and Mycelium Wallet are all on the list. Users are encouraged to send all of their funds to a desktop or online wallet and wait until their favorite mobile wallet comes out with an upgrade to fix the problem. Bitcoin Wallet for Android already did; Bitcoin Wallet for Android users need only download the latest version from the play store and the wallet will move insecure funds to a new secure address automatically.\nThe source of the bug is the java.security.SecureRandom method in Android, which, as developer Andreas Schildbach describes it \u201chas multiple severe bugs that render it useless for cryptographic purposes.\u201d The problem is this: the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm, which Bitcoin transactions rely on for security, has three inputs: the transaction, the signer\u2019s private key and a random number. The algorithm then outputs two values, denoted r and s, where s is calculated with the formula k-1(z+rd), z being the hash of the message, k the random number and d the private key. r is dependent only on k. Thus, if the owner of an address signs two transactions with the same random number (and of course the same private key, as every address is linked to one private key), one can extract two s values from the two signatures, subtract them to make the rd terms cancel out, and extracting the private key from there becomes a simple division problem (a more detailed writeup can be found here). Normally, this is not a problem; given a true random number generator, the first \u201ccollision\u201d should take place roughly at the same time as the heat death of the universe. As it turned out, however, java.security.SecureRandom proved to be not so random, generating the same \u201crandom\u201d number twice on many occasions.\nIt is because of the possibility of clever attacks like this that Bitcoin developers recommend a simple strategy: never re-using the same address twice. Whenever money is sent from a Bitcoin address, the wallet should empty out the entire contents of that address, send as much as needed to the intended recipient, and send the rest of the funds to other, previously unused addresses, controlled by the wallet. Not doing this does not mean that your funds are insecure; the exploit here relies on the weakness of Java\u2019s random number generator, and given a proper random number generator (eg. os.urandom) elliptic curve DSA remains as strong as ever. However, if the implementation turns out to be somewhat flawed it does leave you vulnerable, and even in normal cases address re-use weakens Bitcoin\u2019s privacy. If some mad scientist in an underground cave suddenly appears with a fully-functional quantum computer, only addresses that have never been spent from will be safe. The reason is that if you have bitcoins in an address that you never sent any transactions from, there is very little information that attackers have to figure out your private key; in fact, the 34-character string is all an attacker has to go on. And even that doesn\u2019t help much; the hash algorithms used to derive the address are extremely secure, and will hold their own even against a quantum computer.\nThis event should also be a wake-up call to Bitcoin users to look at other potential flaws in their wallet security. There have been many instances of Bitcoin users having their wallets hacked through little fault of their own, with attackers grabbing their passwords through Android root privileges, Java keyloggers and worse; if you are holding a large number of bitcoins, you would do well to store them in a wallet that you use as little as possible. Keeping a separate spending and savings wallet should be the norm; ideally, you should use some kind of mixer to send money between the two to preserve privacy. Today, the problem is insecure random number generators. Tomorrow, it might be a breakthrough in repurposing Bitcoin mining ASICs to cracking brainwallets. Or another integer overflow. Or a multi-confirmation double-spend attack made possible by hacking into some Electrum servers or forging blockchain.info\u2019s SSL certificate. The lesson here is this: there is still a long way to go before we iron out all of the security flaws that Bitcoin implementations might have. The traditional financial system has had forty years, and even they aren\u2019t done.", "year": 2013, "month": 8, "day": 12}
{"title": "What Proof of Stake Is And Why It Matters", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/what-proof-of-stake-is-and-why-it-matters-1377531463/", "birthday": "Aug 26, 2013  11:37 AM EST", "date": "2013-08-26 16:37:00", "content": "If you have been involved in Bitcoin for any significant length of time, you have probably at least heard of the idea of \u201cproof of work\u201d. The basic concept behind proof of work is simple: one party (usually called the prover) presents the result of a computation which is known to be hard to compute, but easy to verify, and by verifying the solution anyone else can be sure that the prover performed a certain amount of computational work to generate the result. The first modern application, presented as \u201cHashcash\u201d by Adam Back in 1996, uses a SHA256-based proof of work as an anti-spam measure \u2013 by requiring all emails to come with a strong proof-of-work attached, the system makes it uneconomical for spammers to send mass emails while still allowing individuals to send messages to each other when they need to. A similar system is used today for the same purpose in Bitmessage, and the algorithm has also been repurposed to serve as the core of Bitcoin\u2019s security in the form of \u201cmining\u201d.\nHow does SHA256 Proof of Work Work?SHA256 is what cryptographers call a \u201cone-way function\u201d \u2013 a function for which it is easy to calculate an output given an input, but it is impossible to do the reverse without trying every possible input until one works by random chance. The canonical representation of a SHA256 output is as a series of 64 hexadecimal digits \u2013 letters and numbers taken from the set 0123456789abcdef. For example, here are the first digits of a few hashes:SHA256(\"hello\") = 2cf24dba...SHA256(\"Hello\") = 185f8db3...SHA256(\"Hello.\") = 2d8bd7d9...The output of SHA256 is designed to be highly chaotic; even the smallest change in the input completely scrambles the output, and this is part of what makes SHA256 a one-way function. Finding an input whose SHA256 starts with \u20180\u2019 on average takes 16 attempts, \u201900\u2019 takes 256 attempts, and so forth. The way Hashcash, and Bitcoin mining, work, is by requiring provers (ie. mail senders or miners) to find a \u201cnonce\u201d such that SHA256(message+nonce) starts with a large number of zeroes, and then send the valid nonce along with the message as the proof of work. For example, the hash of block 254291 is:000000000000003cf55c8d254fc97d2850547e5b787a936bc729497d76443a89On average, it would take 72057 trillion attempts to find a nonce that, when hashed together with a block, returns a value starting with this many zeroes (technically, 282394 trillion since the POW requirement is a bit more complex than \u201cstarts with this many zeroes\u201d, but the general principle is the same). The reason this artificial difficulty exists is to prevent attackers from overpowering the Bitcoin network and introducing alternative blockchains that reverse previous transactions and block new transactions; any attacker trying to flood the Bitcoin network with their own fake blocks would need to make 282394 trillion SHA256 computations to produce each one.\nHowever, there is a problem: proof of work is highly wasteful. Six hundred trillion SHA256 computations are being performed by the Bitcoin network every second, and ultimately these computations have no practical or scientific value; their only purpose is to solve proof of work problems that are deliberately made to be hard so that malicious attackers cannot easily pretend to be millions of nodes and overpower the network. Of course, this waste is not inherently evil; given no alternatives, the wastefulness of proof of work may well be a small price to pay for the reward of a decentralized and semi-anonymous global currency network that allows anyone to instantly send money to anyone else in the world for virtually no fee. And in 2009 proof of work was indeed the only option. Four years later, however, we have developed a number of alternatives.\nSunny King\u2019s Primecoin is perhaps the most moderate, and yet at the same time potentially the most promising, solution. Rather than doing away with proof of work entirely, Primecoin seeks to make its proof of work useful. Rather than using SHA256 computations, Primecoin requires miners to look for long \u201cCunningham chains\u201d of prime numbers \u2013 chains of values n-1, 2n-1, 4n-1, etc up to some length such that all of the values in the chain are prime (for the sake of accuracy, n+1, 2n+1, 4n+1 can also be a valid Cunningham chain, and Primecoin also accepts \u201cbi-twin chains\u201d of the form n-1, n+1, 2n-1, 2n+1\u2026 where all terms are prime). It is not immediately obvious how these chains are useful \u2013 Primecoin advocates have pointed to a few theoretical applications, but these all require only chains of length 3 which are trivial to produce. However, the stronger argument is that in modern Bitcoin mining the majority of the production cost of mining hardware is actually researching methods of mining more efficiently (ASICs, optimized circuits, etc) and not building or running the devices themselves, and in a Primecoin world this research would go towards finding more efficient ways of doing arithmetic and number theory computation instead \u2013 things which have applications far beyond just mining cryptocurrencies.\nThe reason why Primecoin-like \u201cuseful POWs\u201d are the most promising is that, if the computations are useful enough, the currency\u2019s \u201cwaste factor\u201d can actually drop below zero, making the currency a public good. For example, suppose that there is a computation which, somehow, has a 1 in 1020chance of getting researchers significantly further along the way to curing cancer. Right now, no individual or organization has much of an incentive to attempt it: if they get lucky and succeed, they could either release the secret and earn little personal benefit beyond some short-lived media recognition or they could try to sell it to a few researchers under a non-disclosure agreement, which would rob everyone not under the non-disclosure agreement of the benefits of the discovery and likely not earn too much money in any case. If this magic computation was integrated into a currency, however, the block reward would incentivize many people to perform the computation, and the results of the computations would be visible on the blockchain for everyone to see. The societal reward would be more than worth the electricity cost. However, so far we know of no magical cancer-curing computation; the closest is Folding@home, but it lacks mathematical verificability \u2013 a dishonest miner can easily cheat by making fake computations that are indistinguishable from real results to any proof of work checker but have no value to society. As far as mathematically verifiable useful POWs go, Primecoin is the best we have, and whether its societal benefit fully outweighs its production and electricity cost is hard to tell; many people doubt it. But even then, what Primecoin accomplished is very praiseworthy; even partially recovering the costs of mining as a public good is better than nothing.\nProof of Stake\nHowever, there is one SHA256 alternative that is already here, and that essentially does away with the computational waste of proof of work entirely: proof of stake. Rather than requiring the prover to perform a certain amount of computational work, a proof of stake system requires the prover to show ownership of a certain amount of money. The reason why Satoshi could not have done this himself is simple: before 2009, there was no kind of digital property which could securely interact with cryptographic protocols. Paypal and online credit card payments have been around for over ten years, but those systems are centralized, so creating a proof of stake system around them would allow Paypal and credit card providers themselves to cheat it by generating fake transactions. IP addresses and domain names are partially decentralized, but there is no way to construct a proof of ownership of either that could be verified in the future. Indeed, the first digital property that could possibly work with an online proof of stake system is Bitcoin (and cryptocurrency in general) itself.\nThere have been several proposals on how proof of stake can be implemented; the only one that is currently working in practice, however, is PPCoin, once again created by Sunny King. PPCoin\u2019s proof of stake algorithm works as follows. When creating a proof-of-stake block, a miner needs to construct a \u201ccoinstake\u201d transaction, sending some money in their possession to themselves as well as a preset reward (like an interest rate, similar to Bitcoin\u2019s 25 BTC block reward). A SHA256 hash is calculated based only on the transaction input, some additional fixed data, and the current time (as an integer representing the number of seconds since Jan 1, 1970). This hash is then checked against a proof of work requirement, much like Bitcoin, except the difficulty is inversely proportional to the \u201ccoin age\u201d of the transaction input. Coin age is defined as the size of the transaction input, in PPcoins, multiplied by the time that the input has existed. Because the hash is based only on the time and static data, there is no way to make hashes quickly by doing more work; every second, each PPCoin transaction output has a certain chance of producing a valid work proportional to its age and how many PPCoins it contains, and that is that. Essentially, every PPCoin can act as a \u201csimulated mining rig\u201d, albeit with the interesting property that its mining power goes up linearly over time but resets to zero every time it finds a valid block.\nIt is not clear if using coin age as PPCoin does rather than just output size is strictly necessary; the original intent of doing so was to prevent miners from re-using their coins multiple times, but PPCoin\u2019s current design does not actually allow miners to consciously try to generate a block with a specific transaction output. Rather, the system does the equivalent of picking a PPCoin at random every second and maybe giving its owner the right to create a block. Even without including age as a weighting factor in the randomness, this is roughly equivalent to a Bitcoin mining setup but without the waste. However, there is one more sophisticated argument in coin age\u2019s favor: because your chance of success goes up the longer you fail to create a block, miners can expect to create blocks more regularly, reducing the incentive to dampen the risk by creating the equivalent of centralized mining pools.\nBeyond Cryptocurrency\nBut what makes proof of stake truly interesting is the fact that it can be applied to much more than just currency. So far, anti-spam systems have fallen into three categories: proof of work, captchas and identity systems. Proof of work, used in systems like Hashcash and Bitmessage, we have already discussed extensively above. Captchas are used very widely on the internet; the idea is to present a problem that a human can easily solve but a computer can\u2019t, thereby distinguishing the two (CAPTCHA stands for \u201cCompletely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart\u201d). In practice, this usually involves presenting a messy image containing letters and numbers, and requiring the solver to type in what the letters and numbers are. Recent providers have implemented a \u201cpublic good\u201d component into the system by making part of the captcha a word from a printed book, using the power of the crowd to digitize old printed literature. Unfortunately, captchas are not that effective; recent machine-learning efforts have achieved success rates of 30-96% \u2013 similar to that of humans themselves. Identity systems come in two forms. First, there are systems that require users to register with their physical identity; this is how democracies have so far avoided being overrun by anonymous trolls. Second, there are systems that require some fee to get into, and moderators can close accounts without refund if they are found to be trying to abuse the system. These systems work, but at the cost of privacy.\nProof of stake can be used to provide a fourth category of anti-spam measure. Imagine that, instead of filling in a captcha to create a forum account, a user can consume coin age by sending a Bitcoin or PPCoin transaction to themselves instead. To make sure each proof of stake computation is done by the user, and not simply randomly pulled from the blockchain, the system might require the user to also send a signed message with the same address, or perhaps send their money back to themselves in a specific way (eg. one of the outputs must contain exactly 0.000XXXXX BTC, with the value randomly set each time). Note that here coin age is crucial; we want users to be able to create proofs of stake on demand, so something must be consumed to prevent reuse. In a way, a form of proof of stake already exists in the form of SMS verification, requiring users to send text messages to prove ownership of a phone to create a Google account \u2013 although this is hardly pure proof of stake, as phone numbers are also heavily tied with physical identity and the process of buying a phone is itself a kind of captcha. Thus, SMS verification has some of the advantages and some of the disadvantages of all three systems.\nBut proof of stake\u2019s real advantage is in decentralized systems like Bitmessage. Currently, Bitmessage uses proof of work because it has no other choice; there is no \u201cdecentralized captcha\u201d solution out there, and there has been little research into figuring out how to make one. However, proof of work is wasteful, and makes Bitmessage a somewhat cumbersome and power-consuming system to use \u2013 for emails, it\u2019s fine, but for instant messaging forget about it. But if Bitmessage could be integrated into Bitcoin (or Primecoin or PPCoin) and use it as proof of stake, much of the difficulty and waste could be alleviated.\nDoes proof of stake have a future? Many signs suggest that it certainly does. PPCoin founder Sunny King argues that Bitcoin\u2019s security will become too weak over time as its block reward continues to drop; indeed, this is one of his primary motivations for creating PPCoin and Primecoin. Since then, PPCoin has come to be the fifth largest cryptocurrency on the market, and an increasing number of new cryptocurrencies are copying its proof-of-stake design. Currently, PPCoin is not fully proof-of-stake; because it is a small cryptocurrency with a highly centralized community, the risk of some kind of takeover is higher than with Bitcoin, so a centralized checkpointing system does exist, allowing developers to create \u201ccheckpoints\u201d that are guaranteed to remain part of the transaction history forever regardless of what any attacker does. Eventually, the intent is to both move toward making the checkpointing system more decentralized and reducing its power and PPCoins come to be owned by a larger group of people. An alternative approach might be to integrate proof of stake as a decentralized checkpointing system into Bitcoin itself; for example, one protocol might allow any coalition of people with at least 1 million BTC-years to consume their outputs to generate a checkpoint that the community would agree is a valid block, at the cost of sending their coins to themselves and consuming coin age.\nIn 2009, cryptocurrency emerged as the culmination of a number of unrelated cryptographic primitives: hash functions, Merkle trees, proof of work and public key cryptography all play key roles in Bitcoin\u2019s construction. Now, however, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are here to stay, and this presents another exciting possibility for the future of cryptography: we can now design protocols that build off of cryptocurrency itself \u2013 of which proof of stake is the perfect example. Proof of stake can be used to secure a cryptocurrency, it can be used in decentralized anti-spam systems, and probably in dozens of other protocols that we haven\u2019t even thought of yet \u2013 just like no one had thought of anything like Bitcoin until Wei Dai\u2019s b-money in 1998. The possibilities are endless.", "year": 2013, "month": 8, "day": 26}

BitMonet\u2019s partnership with BitPay will permit customers to monetize content with bitcoin micropayments.\nBitMonet\u2019s embrace of Bitcoin through BitPay alleviates excessively high interchange fees that make many micropayments impractical. As a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, Bitcoin paves the way for micropayments over the Internet. International payments are also more feasible. BitMonet provides publishers with a monetization tool for digital content.\nBitMonet was started in 2013 by Ankur Nandwani and Valerie Chao and is free and easy to install, allowing publishers to sell individual content a-la-carte, or through time-metered access. Through BitMonet, publishers can bring in greater returns than traditional advertising. For example, even at a price point of 1 cent per content, a publisher can receive 10 dollars per 1,000 views. Services like BitMonet also provide a better reading experience as the focus is shifted from advertising to content.\nMoving forward, publishers with a BitPay merchant account can now install the BitMonet script on their website and start collecting payments. As with all merchants, BitPay will permit publishers using BitMonet to decide whether to keep incoming bitcoins or exchange for a different currency.\nBitcoin Magazine had an opportunity to interview Ankur Nandwani of BitMonet.\nBitcoin Magazine: When did you first hear about Bitcoin?\nAnkur Nandwani: I first heard about Bitcoin when a friend of mine asked for help in evaluating potential investment opportunities in Bitcoin companies. So in the process of preparing a report, I ended up learning a lot about the technology behind Bitcoin and the various companies in the space.\nBM: What was it about Bitcoin that you found interesting?\nAN: What I've found the most interesting is the financial system that is being built around Bitcoin. The same financial system that exists in more traditional currencies is developing around Bitcoin, only at a hyper-aggressive pace. Being able to witness the birth and growth of this financial system has been extremely interesting for me.\nBM: When did you first get the idea for your services and what inspired you to create the site?\nAN: I am an avid news reader. I spend 2-3 hours every day reading news from all over the world. Over the last few years, I've noticed that some of the websites I visit have started putting up paywalls. Often, when I want to read only one article, paying $20 for a subscription just doesn't make sense. So I started doing research on how I could deal with this problem. This was around the time that I was researching Bitcoin investment opportunities, and it just clicked for me.\nBM: Were there any pre-existing businesses that inspired you to create your services? \u00a0\nAN: I developed the initial concept when I noticed a void in the market around ways for publishers to accept Bitcoin; most of the solutions out there were too generic, and did not focus on any specific vertical market. The ones that did exist were built around traditional payment methods, which made it difficult to monetize a single piece of content.\nBM: Where do you see services going in a year? \u00a0\nAN: Right now we are only focussing on the publisher vertical, so for the next few months we plan to optimize and improve our current offering for that specific type of user. We're planning on developing plugins for a number of popular publishing platforms. Once we have a strong foothold, we plan to look into expanding into other areas like social gaming and mobile platforms like Android and iOS. As we have mentioned before, all these solutions will be offered for free, and incur no transactions fees.\nBM: What makes your product stand out in comparison to other businesses utilizing Bitcoin?\nAN: Compared to other products, BitMonet is much easier to use and gives a much larger opportunity for customization. By offering an easy way for publishers to customize BitMonet, the solution can fit the current branding of the product and whatever payment model the publisher desires, either a-la-carte, or through time-metered access.\nBM: What are your suggestions for individuals hoping to start a business like yours?\nAN: We've decided that instead of running BitMonet as a business, we're going to use it to promote adoption of Bitcoin. That's why we are making our library open source and available free for anyone to download and modify. Additionally, there are no transaction fees for using BitMonet. We're hoping that others follow our lead so that Bitcoin can become more widespread.\nBM: If I am a customer looking to use your services, how can I get started?\nAN:Getting started with BitMonet is really easy; it takes about 10 minutes. We provide step-by-step instructions on how to integrate BitMonet into your existing website on our documentation page. We're also happy to answer any technical questions that may come up, just contact us at contact@bitmonet.com. We find feedback really valuable and are always looking for ways to improve BitMonet.", "year": 2013, "month": 8, "day": 27}
{"title": "Feathercoin: Interview With Peter Bushnell", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/feathercoin-interview-with-peter-bushnell-1376355117/", "birthday": "Aug 12, 2013  8:51 PM EST", "date": "2013-08-13 01:51:00", "content": "In this past month, it seems like alternate cryptocurrencies have been all the rage. Earlier last month, Sunny King released Primecoin, a prime-number based cryptocurrency that is the first to attempt to make its mining algorithm simultaneously serve some kind of social value, and the currency was mentioned on BusinessInsider less than two days after launch. The currency then grew quickly, getting its own gambling site and exchange within three days. The surprising thing is that Primecoin is not unique in this. Over the past two years, we have seen the development of over seventy alternate currencies with features ranging from a smaller or larger number of coins to faster confirmations and radically different alternatives to Bitcoin\u2019s proof of work.\nOne of the less radical alternatives in the alternative cryptocurrency, or \u201caltcoin\u201d, scene is Feathercoin, a currency introduced by Peter Bushnell on April 16, 2013. On a technical level, Feathercoin started off not being significantly different from Litecoin; the only change was an increase in the final currency supply from 84 million to 336 million. Later on, however, the currency developed other small differences; one change is faster difficulty retargets, allowing the network to adjust more quickly to changes in network power. Another is an advanced checkpointing system, which lead developer Peter Bushnell says will make Feathercoin \u201cmore resilient to 51% attacks than Bitcoin or Litecoin.\u201d More importantly, however,Bushnell explains, the real attraction of altcoins is not necessarily just the minor details of their core features, but also the surrounding ecosystem. The ecosystem around Bitcoin is bloated; major changes to the main client are always met with great opposition, and for good reason \u2013 a billion dollar economy depends on it. \u201cFeathercoin,\u201d Bushnell writes, \u201cby comparison is dynamic and agile. It is hard for people to get involved in Bitcoin in the same way that they could be involved in Feathercoin, we are still young and look to remain open to new people and ideas. Feathercoin has proved that it is able to evolve when faced with problems and looks to become more resilient than Bitcoin.\u201d\nSome of the newest developments around Feathercoin include the United Open Currency Solutions Group (UNOCS), an advocacy group made in collaboration with WorldCoin and PhenixCoin, a system to protect against attacks known as \u201cadvanced checkpointing\u201d, and an E-bay style marketplace. Feathercoin now has the sixth largest market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, placing it above Novacoin, Primecoin and Devcoin but below PPCoin, Namecoin and the \u201cbig three\u201d of Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ripple. In this interview, Peter Bushnell shares his thoughts on why he created Feathercoin, the current situation that alternative currencies are in, and the promise that they offer for the future.\n\nVitalik Buterin: What\u2019s your personal background? What were you involved in before Bitcoin, and how did you first find out about Bitcoin? What about the currency interested you?\nPeter Bushnell: For the last eleven years I have been working as Head of IT at Brasenose College which is one of the colleges that make up Oxford University. It is a long time to be in any one place and now that I\u2019m working with crypto currencies life is a lot more fast-paced and infinitely more interesting. I first heard of Bitcoin from New Scientist many years ago, before I actually become involved myself. When I first arrived on the scene in late 2011 I started mining Bitcoin, which was very unsatisfactory as I could only mine 0.1 coins a day. I was not mining as a means to make some money but just to play and collect some coins; I have always had an enthusiasm for technology and computers which is why I ended up working in IT professionally. Finally, I found Litecoin, which at the time was very young and had hardly any value, and the joy of Litecoin was that I could actually mine many of them. When I first found Litecoin there was a fair bit of enthusiasm surrounding it, and many saw it co-existing happily with Bitcoin \u2013 which I believed to be true.\nWhat interested me about Bitcoin was the fact that it worked. When I read the New Scientist article I was intrigued as I imagined it would be a tough task getting a value attached to these Bitcoins, but there the markets were which gave Bitcoin its value and allowed the whole world to trade with one another almost instantly without having to use the traditional and costly banking systems.\nVitalik: What made you decide to create an alternative cryptocurrency?\nPeter: I am a big supporter of Litecoin, but I found that it had run out of steam as there seemed to be little effort to progress, my emails to Litecoin devs went unanswered and I had to question what I really knew about Litecoin. Having a Scrypt coin made sense as GPU miners were soon to be looking for a new home with the coming of ASIC miners, and I was waiting for another Scrypt coin to jump on to and had in my mind what I wanted ideally. Mincoin came along, but it launched without a Qt GUI and had very large rewards for initial blocks. This seemed largely unfair. We then saw the Russian Novacoin launch which was pre-mined before it was launched to the public, and I also saw that as unfair.\nI had the idea of a coin that simply followed on what Litecoin had started with Bitcoin by having four times as many coins as Litecoin; that seemed to be the next natural step. It occurred that I could code the coin myself, which is exactly what I did. The good news since Feathercoin launched is that Litecoin woke up and did something \u2013 competition is a good thing.\nVitalik: I understand it, Feathercoin\u2019s only two technical differences from Litecoin are 4x faster difficulty retargets and 4x more coins. Why did you decide to change these aspects of Litecoin? Why are these features important? Are there any other differences between the two that I\u2019m missing?\nPeter: The core difference at the beginning was simply four times as many coins, like Litecoin having four times as many coins as Bitcoin. Since our launch we have changed to incorporate a four times quicker difficulty adjust which works better for a network smaller than that of Bitcoin or Litecoin. This shows the willingness to evolve to deal with problems that our network is faced with.\nRight now, we are working on a feature known as advanced checkpointing. Currently blockchain checkpoints are compiled into the client which has to be redistributed. To protect against attackers orphaning genuine blocks, checkpoints will be issued after blocks have been created. Advanced Checkpointing prevents 51% attacks and is an example of where smaller coins contribute to all crypto currencies. Smaller coins have to deal with a lot of things that do not concern Bitcoin or Litecoin. With Advanced Checkpointing implemented Feathercoin will be more resilient to 51% attacks than Bitcoin or Litecoin.\nVitalik: Could you explain to me how this advanced checkpointing mechanism works?\nPeter: Feathercoin experienced 51% attacks where the attackers managed to orphan genuine blocks and get their own mined blocks accepted by the network. This is very frustrating to the miners and exposes users to the risk of reversed transactions. Bitcoin includes a checkpointing system to solve this problem, where certain blocks can be hardcoded into the client so that your client will only ever connect to the blockchain with those blocks in it.\nAdvanced Checkpointing works by providing a feed of checkpoints that clients subscribe to. When a block gets created it will be checkpointed automatically by a single node in the first iteration of the software. This checkpoint will be put into a feed which other clients will be subscribed to. The other clients will pick up this checkpoint and will start rejecting blockchains that do not include the block referenced in the checkpoint. This is not mandatory as clients can opt-out. If the feed goes down, the network carries on as normal and when the feed comes back it starts checkpointing from the end of the network blockchain.\nThis system needs to be distributed to be made more resilient and move away from the centralization that this introduces. This solution upsets the purists but is the lesser of two evils. We have experienced several 51% attacks on the Feathercoin network and we would rather see the network out of attackers\u2019 hands. The attackers that have been targeting us have 3GH Scrypt or 3TH SHA-256 of mining power. The attackers have excellent knowledge of exactly how the network operates and have run some impressive attacks. Our hashrate is to high for them to attack Feathercoin right now but they could get more hash power but for now they have moved on to other smaller coins. With attackers like this out there everyone should be worried.\nVitalik: If someone on the street (or the internet) asked you \u201cwhy should I use Feathercoin?\u201d, how would you answer?\nPeter: Feathercoin is a very active coin with a lot of enthusiasm. We have very different pressures compared to Bitcoin which is making us evolve much faster than the lumbering giant that Bitcoin has become. It is indeed hard for Bitcoin to move too fast without creating a lot of upset. Feathercoin by comparison is dynamic and agile. I always encourage people to visit the Feathercoin forum as anyone can get involved. We are a transparent coin with an active community. It is hard for people to get involved in Bitcoin in the same way that they could be involved in Feathercoin, we are still young and look to remain open to new people and ideas. Feathercoin has proved that it is able to evolve when faced with problems and looks to become more resilient than Bitcoin.\nVitalik: Much of the Feathercoin community\u2019s emphasis so far, as I understand, has been on creating better software, tutorials, marketplaces and the like. Why not simply make better software, tutorials and marketplaces for Bitcoin?\nPeter: We need diversity if something is going to survive, it is simply the survival of the fittest. A lot of people complained that Litecoin was going to damage cryptocurrency, which to me seemed absurd as Litecoin was clearly trying something new. What I find disappointing is how many people with Litecoin in their pockets now throw stones at Feathercoin for those same reasons. Having many coins trying different things will allow us to explore what works in cryptocurrency; as long as these coins have some value on the market then they can be used to send money around the world.\nVitalik: What is your opinion on the state of alternative cryptocurrencies in general?\nPeter: I believe that cryptocurrencies right now are in a bit of a lull. There are some major obstacles that we are faced with which makes things seem a bit gloomy to some. Gox is a good example of the troubles experienced dealing with banks and payment processors. What people do not realize is that are so many people working to solve some of these obstacles and there are already several solutions coming on to the horizon. The world of cryptocurrency is going to look very different in a couple of years\u2019 time.\nVitalik: What role do you see alternative cryptocurrencies playing in the future? Do you expect any of them to overtake Bitcoin in the near or mid-term future? If so, what would be some of the factors driving such an outcome?\nPeter: Alternative cryptocurrencies is where we are going to see the real technical progress made. Bitcoin needs to try and maintain a steady course, whereas the other currencies can evolve much faster. Feathercoin has more coins than Bitcoin by design so that it can exist as a lower value coin. This is supposed to remain true, and Feathercoin should not threaten Bitcoin\u2019s value directly. Since Feathercoin is an open source project leaves, any innovations made in the client can be picked up by Bitcoin. As long as Bitcoin remains active and adapts then I expect it to remain a strong force for cryptocurrency adoption.\nVitalik: Feathercoin, Worldcoin and PhenixCoin recently partnered to form the \u201cUnited Open Currencies Solutions Group\u201d. Could you explain in more detail what this organization is, and what its objectives are?\nPeter: The idea behind UNOCS is that working together we can do more than apart. UNOCS gives us a name under which we can undertake joint projects. I would like to see more coins work together rather than just view everyone else as a threat. It\u2019s not a merger; even though we have this partnership together, we are all still independent coins. The organization\u2019s first project will be the UNOCS Bridge, which allows merchants to accept all UNOCS coins without having to wait for transactions as all the coins are held in the system. The system handles exchanging between coins and eventually will allow people to move to fiat. That is the long term goal \u2013 to ease movement between crypto and fiat. here does seem to be a lot of people working towards solutions like this which I find very reassuring, as moving from fiat to crypto and back can be far more difficult than it should be. I find that the legacy banking seems to be somewhat hostile to cryptocurrency.\nVitalik: What are some of your future plans with Feathercoin, both in the near and long term?\nPeter: The main objective of Feathercoin is to survive long term, to continue to adapt to the world it finds itself in. There are many opportunities for cryptocurrency and we do not intend to miss them. There are places in the world local currency is having trouble where cryptocurrencies could be a real solution, we are looking to lower entry requirements to cryptocurrency by implementing SMS based wallets. This increases access to Feathercoin in places that do not have high end smart phones available. I hope that cryptocurrency can solve some of the financial problems that the world faces today, giving anyone with a basic phone access to a cryptocurrency account puts a lot of power back into the hands of the people. You can see that all these efforts are working to a time where cryptocurrency finds its critical mass. Cryptocurrency is going to be the biggest technical innovation since the birth of the Internet.", "year": 2013, "month": 8, "day": 13}

This means all existing orders will be re-priced to the new pricing based upon order quantity.\nThese three guarantees were designed to allay customers\u2019 fears that they would see a repeat of previous Bitcoin mining mishaps; the first two were motivated by the long delays of Butterfly Labs, which released their devices in April 2013 rather than October 2012 as was originally intended, and the last guarantee is a response to ASICMiner, which has reduced the prices on their Block Erupter USBs from an initial 1.99 BTC to a low of 0.175 BTC, making ASICMiner buyers who had made the purchase at the initial high price feel like they had been cheated of their money. One guarantee that Cointerra does not make, but another business does, is that of Hashfast; as their own page on the subject describes it:\nIf the Bitcoin network hashrate increases so that your Baby Jet doesn\u2019t generate more Bitcoins in ninety days than you paid for it, HashFast will give you additional ASICs. In fact, we will give you up to 400% more hashing capacity than the Baby Jet you purchased. Yes, that does mean that if you don\u2019t make your money back in 90 days, we will increase your mining capacity to up to 2 Terahashes!\nHashcash\u2019s mining stats are also impressive, offering $11.2 per GH/s ($2.8 if the guarantee kicks in) and shipping by October. Unfortunately, however, their own mining rigs are currently sold out.\nIn general, sheer growth of the Bitcoin mining economy is highly impressive. Five months ago, ASICMiner chief friedcat was met with a large amount of disbelief when he claimed that the power of the Bitcoin network would increase to at least 1000 TH/s by the end of the year. Now, the network is at 600 TH/s already, and Cointerra\u2019s claim of 2 PH/s by December appears downright uncontroversial by comparison. Two months ago, KnCMiner, with their $20 per GH/s devices planned for shipping in October was all the rage; today, even they have slipped into the background as Butterfly Labs\u2019 Monarch and now the TerraMiner have taken center stage.\nThe security of the Bitcoin network is increasing rapidly as a result. Taking an estimate of 1 MH/s per CPU, the Bitcoin network\u2019s current hashrate of 600 TH/s is now so powerful that a botnet seeking to overpower the Bitcoin network and mount a 51% attack would need to literally take over nearly every computer in the world to be effective. And once Cointerra\u2019s two petahashes come in, the threat of botnet takeover will be outright impossible. From here, it\u2019s simply a matter of increasing the cost of a successful attack. So far, most people trying to estimate this cost start out by trying to figure out how much money it would take to purchase the right amount of ASICs or develop a fabrication facility in house \u2013 however, this is a very difficult thing to do accurately. A more successful alternative strategy is to instead measure the \u201copportunity cost\u201d \u2013 the potential profit of using the amount of mining power needed to pull off an attack honestly, which would be thrown away by using the power to attack Bitcoin instead. Resallex has an automatic calculator that does this; currently the price stands at $400 million, out of reach of the annual military budget of half of all governments in the world. Some of Resallex\u2019s estimates are questionable; the 8% annual discounting rate on future returns, for example, is far too low given the inherent risk in the Bitcoin economy, and a more reasonable estimate of 20% would give Bitcoin a \u201ctakedown cost\u201d of $150 million. In either case, however, the Bitcoin network is clearly becoming a force to be reckoned with.", "year": 2013, "month": 8, "day": 27}

Regulators are attempting to understand where to begin with a digital currency that is not backed by a central government like traditional fiat currencies. The main concerns of regulators are to ensure that Bitcoin and other digital, decentralized currencies are not used for illegal activities such as drug purchases or money laundering. Patrick Murck along with additional representatives from the Bitcoin Foundation hope to alleviate concerns of regulators and answer any questions to be able to move forward in a safe regulatory environment.\n\nTheWall Street Journal highlighted the desire for the Bitcoin Foundation and some Bitcoin companies to comply with certain laws. The Bitcoin Foundation and many members of the Bitcoin community would prefer transparency should regulations be put in place. As Bitcoin is a growing cryptocurrency, the Bitcoin community needs an understanding of any existing regulations and plans for regulations.\n\nThe main purpose of today\u2019s Washington, DC meetings will be for representatives from the Bitcoin Foundation to highlight how useful and applicable to businesses and individuals around the world Bitcoin has become. Yet, Bitcoin Foundation representatives will also stress that the US will not be able to benefit fully from Bitcoin should regulators crack down with excess regulations. Bitcoin startups will not be able to thrive and survive in the US should regulations be piled on without consideration of the impact on Bitcoin growth and development and the merits of Bitcoin.\n\nWith the Bitcoin economy at over$1.4 Billion, US regulators have the potential to learn more about Bitcoin prior to pressing for constricting regulations to permit the Bitcoin community to continue to flourish and also allow the US to truly benefit economically from the increased growth of Bitcoin in the US and around the world. Whereas the Bitcoin community as a whole would prefer limited interaction with government, the opportunity to educate on the merits of Bitcoin has arisen. One can only hope that after today\u2019s meetings, regulators will have a better understanding of the currency and will be slow to act and implement onerous regulations.\n", "year": 2013, "month": 8, "day": 26}

In part as a deliberate effort to downplay Bitcoin\u2019s privacy aspects to regulators, in part as a result of recent revelations from Edward Snowden about the scope of the NSA\u2019s digital surveillance initiatives, and finally in part due to new research regarding the Bitcoin transaction graph itself, the current mood is that Bitcoin may be far less private than we thought. On August 14, researchers from George Mason University released a regulatory primer on Bitcoin heavily downplaying its anonymity. On August 26, Vice released an article \u201cdescribing researchers\u2019 success in de-anonymizing some Bitcoin transactions\u201c, and a similar story ran on Businessweek the next day. However, there are many who see this lack of anonymity as a problem \u2013 and today, two Bitcoin developers in Spain have come up with a solution.\n\nDe-Anonymizing Bitcoin\nFirst, the problem. As commonly understood, Bitcoin\u2019s privacy model is as follows. All Bitcoin transactions are public by necessity; otherwise it would be possible to release many separate transactions sending the same money multiple times, and the fraud would not be discovered until much later. Rather, the privacy of the Bitcoin system comes from the fact that, although transactions are public, the identities behind the transactions are not. Anyone looking at the blockchain can see \u201c1Mcqmmnx send 1.2321 BTC to 1V1tAL\u201d, but what they do not see is exactly who sent the bitcoins to whom. It could be grandma sending bitcoins to buy her grandson a new computer from the BitcoinStore, it could be a vendor cashing out of Silk Road, or it could simply be MtGox sending bitcoins to itself.\nHowever, for the past several years researchers have been showing that this privacy model is not quite so perfect as it seems. In 2011, researchers Fergal Reid and Martin Harrigan released an analysis that, among other things, attempted to trace a 25,000 BTC theft from June 2011. The paper produced no results useful to law enforcement, but was able to follow the money a considerable distance in some places. More recently, researchers in Zurich expanded on Bitcoin de-anonymization techniques, and most recently in August a group of researchers from George Mason University and the University of California, San Diego released a paper entitled \u201cA Fistful of Bitcoins: Characterizing Payments Among Men with No Names\u201c, that appears to successfully follow the money from some Bitcoin thefts all the way to a Bitcoin exchange, which in theory can be asked by law enforcement to reveal the thief\u2019s identity.\nBitcoin de-anonymization essentially relies on one fundamental insight. Given just a set of information about people and a set of information about Bitcoin transactions, with no information connecting the two, it is indeed very hard to figure out which addresses belong to which person. However, as soon as you have even one anchor \u2013 some Bitcoin transaction or address tied to a particular real person or event, from there it becomes possible to \u201cfollow the money\u201d and gather up a load of other information as well. One might discover the Bitcoin address of that user\u2019s employer, favorite businesses, customers, and much more \u2013 or, knowing more anchors, one might quickly figure out what that user\u2019s favorite businesses are. Aside from simply \u201cfollowing the money\u201d, there are also two more advanced tools that Bitcoin sleuths can use.\nFirst, there is a concept called the closure. The closure of an address is defined recursively as follows:\nAn address is in its own closure.If address A is in the closure, and there exists a transaction using coins from address A and address B as inputs, then address B is also in the closure.\nTo calculate the closure of an address, simply repeatedly apply the definition starting from that address until you stop adding new addresses. The power of this concept is the following: all addresses in a closure are almost certainly owned by the same user. If a transaction has multiple inputs, the reason is almost always that a user needed to send some amount of money somewhere but did not have the entire amount in one address, and so the wallet software had to select inputs from two or more different addresses to make the payment. With this tool, if you can show that even one address belongs to a particular person (eg. if you are a merchant accepting a payment from them) then you can potentially uncover most of their entire wallet.\nSecond, the paper also introduces a few heuristic algorithms for detecting what are known as \u201cchange addresses\u201c. Change addresses are used by Bitcoin wallets to send extra money to when spending transaction outputs; for example, if you receive 50 BTC and then proceed to spend 1 BTC, the remaining 49 BTC goes to a change address freshly generated by your wallet. Doing this, rather than sending the 49 BTC back to the original address is done to increase privacy, and much of the paper deals with the difficult question of how one can automatically distinguish between change addresses and the intended output of a transaction. By doing this, the researchers were able to go much further than with closures alone, often following long chains of transactions hundreds of steps, and ultimately their research was successful: they were able to trace some stolen funds all the way to a Bitcoin exchange.\nThe Solution\nThe main solution to the problem so far has been mixing services, such as the one at blockchain.info and the one integrated into Silk Road. A mixing service works as follows. A user provides the mixing service with a destination address, and is given an input address to send their bitcoins to. Thousands of users from around the world send their bitcoins into their mixer, the mixer internally shuffles them, and then sends to each user\u2019s destination address the same quantity of bitcoins (but not the same bitcoins) that they sent in, minus a small fee. The link between the input address and the destination exists nowhere in the blockchain, and in theory the mixing service itself destroys this information as soon as mixing is complete. However, the anonymization comes at the cost of trust. Users need to trust the mixer not to reveal the link between the input and destination, and they also need to trust the mixer not to steal the bitcoins outright. Even worse, if the mixer did steal some bitcoins, there would be no way to prove that it did.\nNow, Bitcoin developers Amir Taaki and Pablo Martin developed with a new solution to Bitcoin anonymity: a semi-decentralized, trust-free mixing system. The underlying idea of a decentralized mixer is not new, and all schemes proposed so far, including this one, work similarly. Some number of people, all wanting to mix some specific quantity of bitcoins (say 0.01 BTC), come together over some communications channel and construct a single transaction, with each person contributing 0.01 BTC as an input and receiving 0.01 BTC as an output. The order of the inputs and outputs is shuffled, so there is no information about which input corresponds to each output in the blockchain. The challenge is, however, making sure that the link between each participant\u2019s input and output is not known to the other participants in the mix as well. One solution was presented by Oliver Coutu at the Bitcoin conference in May 2013, using secure multiparty computation to construct the transaction without anyone being able to see exactly which input or output any other person contributed. However, the underlying mathematics is complex (although not nearly so complex as Zerocoin), and so far no easily usable implementation has been created.\nThe solution that Taaki and Martin implemented is much simpler. The protocol is fully described on the project\u2019s web page, and roughly works as follows:\nN people get together and agree to mix X bitcoins, and one of them sends the values N and X and a \u201croom ID\u201d to a central facilitator.Everyone sends a message containing the room ID and their destination address to the facilitator, using an anonymizing network like Tor to make the communication.The facilitator sends everyone an acknowledgement once all N people sent in their destination addresses.Everyone anonymously sends a message containing the room ID and their input address to the facilitator.The facilitator waits for everyone to send X BTC to their input address, and then constructs a transaction using these inputs and sending X BTC to each of the destination addresses. The facilitator then sends the transaction for everyone to sign.Everyone checks that the transaction sends the right amount of bitcoins to their destination address and, if the transaction checks out, anonymously sends their signature to the facilitator.The facilitator broadcasts the signed transaction.\nAs mentioned above, there is nothing particularly original about the protocol; in fact, Taaki and Martin first discovered the idea from a forum thread created by Bitcoin developer Gregory Maxwell describing the concept under the name of \u201cCoinJoin\u201d. Rather, the magic lies in the implementation. The pair were able to use the Bitcoin toolkit SX, developed by Taaki himself, to quickly implement the transaction handling side of the application within hours \u2013 a process which would have taken many times longer had they tried to write their own code or reuse code from a Bitcoin client like Armory or Electrum.\n\nWhere the implementation outshines previous attempts at accomplishing the same thing is ease of use. Taaki and Martin specifically created a simple graphical user interface; a user need only enter their input address, facilitator URL and output address, and the system handles everything automatically. \u201cWe\u2019ve delivered usable software, simple for grandma (money goes in, money goes out), requires no blockchain or bitcoind, easy to install and trustless,\u201d Taaki writes. For those interested, he has also produced a video depicting the entire process from start to finish; it only takes one minute to go through all the steps. \u201cIt\u2019s experimental software,\u201d Taaki says, \u201cbut it\u2019s usable right now.\u201d Anyone interested in running the mixer can simply download the source code and read the instructions here. Semi-decentralized, trustless Bitcoin anonymity has just been democratized.\nTaaki and Martin\u2019s implementation of CoinJoin has been criticized for being \u201ccentralized\u201d, but in fact the level of centralization is trivial. The central party does not learn which input corresponds to which output (as people send their messages at different times during different phases), and does not have the opportunity to steal the bitcoins. If it tried replacing one of the destination addresses with its own, whoever got left out would notice and refuse to sign the transaction, causing the protocol to fail. The only possible failure mode simply results in the transaction not taking place. Furthermore, anyone can become a facilitator at essentially no startup cost; in fact, a completely decentralized setup might have one of the N people becoming the facilitator on the fly.\nThe mechanism also, perhaps unintentionally, accomplishes another objective: if widely used, it potentially defeats the utility of the \u201cclosure\u201d concept. Closures rely on the idea that all inputs to a transaction are signed by the same person; here, the separate inputs to the mixing transaction are signed by complete strangers. Of course, the protocol as currently implemented can easily be accounted for \u2013 closure algorithms can deliberately avoid transactions with inputs of the same size. However, anonymizers themselves can fight back. Theoretically, one person can participate in the same mix multiple times, sending and receiving the bitcoins in different denominations (eg. sending in a single input of 0.03 BTC and getting three outputs of 0.01 BTC). From the other side, ordinary wallets can try to deliberately make their transactions look like anonymizing transactions; for example, a wallet provider might make their wallet always provide change in 0.01 BTC chunks, so every transaction will naturally appear to be a mix. There will be ways of detecting many of these things, but even still the closure\u2019s status will drop from being a surefire way of discovering someone\u2019s secret Bitcoin stash to just another heuristic tool.\nHow will regulators feel about this? If this mixer reaches a high level of popularity \u2013 for example, by being integrated into existing Bitcoin wallets, it will certainly make the effort to make Bitcoin traceable by regulating the exchanges more difficult. However, for those concerned about large corporations, dictatorships and multibillion dollar drug cartels, there is one saving grace: the more money you want to mix, the harder it will be. \u201cWhile [a thief] might attempt to use a mix service to hide the source of the money,\u201d the George Mason paper reads, \u201cwe again argue that these services do not currently have the volume to launder thousands of bitcoins.\u201d If a billionaire tried to mix their funds with blockchain.info, the mix would become 99% them \u2013 making the mixer essentially useless for the billionaire. Furthermore, at sufficiently high volumes, transaction flows become much more distinguishable all on their own; there may be millions of people moving around 0.01 BTC, but there are only a few people with over 100,000 BTC, and the Bitcoin de-anonymization papers seen thus far have already had considerable success uncovering their stashes of bitcoins on the blockchain. In every case, the story is similar: more money, less privacy. Mixing $50 to hide your medical purchases from Target or your marijuana habit from the government, fine. $1.3 billion suddenly disappearing off the face of the earth? Bitcoin may well actually make that harder.", "year": 2013, "month": 8, "day": 29}

{"title": "Cyprus Depositor Bail-In Set At 47.5%", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/cyprus-depositor-bail-in-set-at-47-5-1375106282/", "birthday": "Jul 29, 2013  9:58 AM EST", "date": "2013-07-29 14:58:00", "content": "According to the latest news from Reuters, the government of Cyprus, the Bank of Cyprus and international lenders have come to an agreement that will recapitalize the bank and allow it to remain solvent: all depositors at the bank will have 47.5% of all funds above the deposit insurance threshold of $100,000 seized to pay for the bank\u2019s bad debts. Originally, 37.5% of all funds above the threshold were deducted and an additional 22.5% temporarily frozen in case of additional emergencies; now, if this agreement goes as planned an extra 10% coming from the frozen funds will go towards bank recapitalization and the remaining 12.5% will be unfrozen for its owners\u2019 free use. The \u201cadditional emergency\u201d in this case might be the fact that the BoC realized that it would not be able to get off lightly by holding on to its real estate for a few years until it could sell it at higher prices after a hypothetical market recovery; rather, the bank needs money now, even if it means selling off land at rock-bottom prices to get it.\nSince the original depositor bail-in plan was announced in March, the idea has been very warmly received by governments around the world. The governments of Japan, Canada, the European Union, Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand have all endorsed or taken preliminary steps toward potentially implementing similar plans if necessary in their own countries. The economic logic behind the proposal is this: rather than banks imposing their fiscal irresponsibility onto the public at large through taxpayer-funded bailouts, depositor bail-ins would keep each bank\u2019s problems confined to its own customers. Bank clients gain the ability to avoid facing any losses by deliberately choosing banks for their responsibility and solvency, and politicians concerned about inflicting severe shocks on the financial system through banks outright collapsing gain the ability to allow banks to only collapse partially, the financial equivalent of a prescribed burn.\nThus, depositors with funds in their bank exceeding the deposit insurance threshold (usually between $100,000 and $500,000) now have an increased incentive to turn to alternative ways of storing and protecting their wealth. The more popular alternatives include credit unions, \u201cethical banking\u201d providers like Triodos Bank in Europe, peer-to-peer lending sites like Prosper and precious metals. Now, we are seeing a new category of asset emerge: cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is by far the oldest and largest, but Ripple credits, litecoins and primecoins have already come up as significant alternatives.\nCryptocurrencies as a form of wealth protection is a highly controversial topic, the main reason being that, especially over the last six months, Bitcoin has been far more volatile than the fiat currencies that its proponents often rail against. Depending on the specific time that they bought in and cashed out, some Bitcoin users have lost even more of what they invested than the 47.5% haircut taken by Cyprus depositors \u2013 and Bitcoin has no depositor insurance threshold. However, as a small part of a toolbox Bitcoin is certainly a very valuable tool. The best analogy here comes from the world of electricity. If you have a circuit with current passing through a number of resistors in parallel, what happens if you add another resistor, one with extremely high resistance, into the mix? The answer is, only a small amount of current will pass through the new resistor and, all in all, despite the extremely high resistance that the new resistor brings the total resistance of the system will go down. Similarly, adding a highly volatile asset to your portfolio can still reduce your portfolio\u2019s volatility as long as you only add a small amount of it \u2013 especially given how disconnected cryptocurrencies are from the economy of the outside world. Arguably, Bitcoin even hedges against the world economy \u2013 if more banks start to collapse, capital controls will increase, people will further lose faith in traditional institutions as a way of protecting themselves, and Bitcoin may become considerably more popular. The fact that Bitcoin\u2019s price started to rise super-exponentially from $50 just two days after the news of the Cyprus bail-in first broke in March may be a coincidence, but is may also have been the primary trigger that set the largest part of the Bitcoin bubble off.\nWhat will the bank account of the twenty-first century look like? Simply put, we don\u2019t know. All we can tell for now is that we are seeing a large outgrowth of new alternatives, and any of them could become the dominant form of long-term wealth storage in the years to come. Treat your money carefully; don\u2019t invest more into any single source than you can afford to lose.", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 29}

The number of major new adoption announcements has dissipated, companies like BitPay and Coinbase have quietly ceased to provide weekly updates on their processing volume and number of new customers, and media attention has significantly died down since the sudden burst of both positive and negative attention in April. The Bitcoin price has slipped through one floor after another, dashing hopes that it would exceed $500 by the end of the summer. Google Trends volume has slowly declined, usage statistics have faltered and legal troubles have led to bitcoins becoming harder to buy as quickly as exchanges keep trying to make it easier; in fact, the most rapidly growing way of buying bitcoins today is on the streets. Now, however, three months after the greatest carnage immediately following Bitcoin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s massive rise to $266, it is time to take another look at where Bitcoin is going, and consider what the next steps are for the Bitcoin economy as a whole to take.\n\nFirst, the price. The events of early June brought a considerable amount of pessimism to the Bitcoin community as a powerful upward trendline starting from even before the largest part of the price bubble was broken. Within days, Bitcoin dropped to $100, and even that level was pierced at the beginning of July as there was simply not enough demand to maintain the price point. What happened in the past month, however, is surprising. Not only did the price make an unexpectedly strong comeback from its low at $65, but it also managed to maintain it, resulting in a sustained upward correction that has now erased essentially 100% of the month\\xe2\\x80\\x99s losses. The price today is essentially the same as the price at the beginning of Porcfest in mid-June. In fact, the rise has sustained itself so well that, just in the last few days, the downward trendline that has dominated Bitcoin price movements since the crash from $130 in June has quietly been broken. This creates some evidence that, perhaps, the price is positioning itself to treat $100 as a long-term point of stability \\xe2\\x80\\x93 similar to $5 in early 2012.\nA Reddit user has provided another interesting chart comparing the Bitcoin price in 2011 and 2013; there, the conclusion is similar: Bitcoin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decline this year was closely following the same pattern as its decline after the bubble in 2011 all the way up until July 10, but since then Bitcoin this year has made an unexpected and decisive comeback.\n\n\nHere we see four different statistics from blockchain.info: the number of unique addresses used, the number of transactions per day, the number of transactions excluding popular addresses (in practice, this means certain mining pools and gambling sites) and the estimated USD transaction volume. All four of these show signs of stopping their decline of even recovering, although for the number of transactions per day it is still too early to tell if the last two weeks are merely a statistical blip. All in all, the evidence looks very positive.\n\nHere is the one chart that provides some reason for further pessimism \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the Google Trends volume. Searches for Bitcoin are continuing to decrease, and the four days with the lowest search volume since the bubble have all been in the last four weeks. However, history shows that Google Trends volume needs to be viewed carefully as an indicator of interest. One theory is that the Google Trends volume represents the derivative of the level of interest in Bitcoin more so than interest in Bitcoin itself. That is to say, most Bitcoin users who are already deeply involved in Bitcoin do not go around Google-searching it; rather, they simply head straight to their own projects or community hotspots like reddit.com/r/bitcoin, Bitcointalk or news sites like our own. People looking up Bitcoin on Google are thus by and large only potential new users. Hence, a 50% decline in the Google Trends volume does not mean that the Bitcoin community has become half as large; it simply means that it is growing half as quickly. Google Trends volume has consistently lagged behind other indicators in the past; for example, the indicator hit its post-2011-bubble low one month after the lowest point in the price, somewhat corroborating this hypothesis.\nSo what does all this mean for the future of Bitcoin? In general, it is further evidence for the Bitcoin economy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s high level of resilience. Even as the shadow of the April 2013 crash still looms over us, the underlying Bitcoin economy is continuing to grow, and it is our job as a community to continue to support it. The next great Bitcoin bubble, if it comes, will likely not come for a while; it may well be that the next year or so will be a time for the new class of Bitcoin entrepreneurs to further integrate itself into the community and develop its products and services, and only after a long time will we see an overt wave of public attention once again. In the near term, some kind of bubble similar to that in January 2011 may potentially happen, although history is unlikely to repeat itself so neatly. For now, keep using Bitcoin, keep developing great projects and services, and enjoy the ride.", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 30}

Bitcoin.de\u2018s Oliver Flaskamper, Defense Distributed\u2019s Cody Wilson, stateless political activist Mike Gogulski, libbitcoin developer Amir Taaki and Mihai and myself from Bitcoin Magazine were all present, along with many others. Now, Room77\u2019s Joerg Platzer has announced that there will be another Bitcoin event taking place tomorrow \u2013 an event which he has dubbed \u201cBitcoin Group Therapy\u201d.\nThe plan is as follows: at 15:00 everyone will meet at Room77 (map), and together the group will decide whether to stay at Room77 or take a twenty-minute walk to the nearby Tempelhof Airport airfield and gather in the sun. Wherever the meeting will be, everyone will be able to talk to the group for 5-10 minutes, followed by a brief question and answer session. The idea is for everyone to have a chance to get the word out about their projects, old and new alike, explaining what they are currently doing and what their plans and visions are. Equally importantly, the speeches will be an opportunity to ask for help; whether your project needs another developer, a translator, legal support or even investment, there will likely be people there who have, or are, exactly what you need. Even those who do not have projects of their own are encouraged to attend; the event will be a great opportunity to learn about what Bitcoin users from Berlin and around the world are doing, and perhaps it may even be the place where you find your new job.\nAfter the speeches, the event will simply become an informal party, and everyone will be free to talk among themselves about whatever they wish. One local Bitcoin user is setting up a barbecue, and those who prefer to follow their own path may wish to have dinner in one of the many Bitcoin-accepting restaurants in Berlin; all of them would be glad to have your support. Hope to see you at Room77!", "year": 2013, "month": 8, "day": 2}

They\u2019ve completely transformed their platform and are integrating Bitcoin into their system.\nWhile at a Bitcoin conference I met Angel Leon, a project lead for FrostWire. Bitcoin, he mentioned to me, has caused a resurgence of excitement in the open-source movement.\nAngel is also working hard on the OpenBazaar Project.\nI asked him some questions about everything from Bitcoin, to FrostWire, and OpenBazaar.\nKevin Cruz: How did you come to begin working on open-source projects and why do you enjoy it?\nEver since I was into school I couldn\u2019t understand why so many people in campus would be so adamant to not show their code, it wasn\u2019t as if they were developing top secret super important technology, I thought we\u2019d learn more from each other if we shared.\nBut it wasn\u2019t until I joined LimeWire in 2005 when I truly began to learn what the Open Source process really meant. From there I moved onto other projects, such as FrostWire, and everything I do, if it can be opened, it will be.\nHow does the vision behind Frostwire relate to the idea of bitcoin?\nBitcoin is the missing key for many projects, not just FrostWire. In our case, we see tremendous opportunities to enable content creators to monetize the content they share with those who can pay what they can, and while they do that, we believe no third party should be involved in taking a cut of the transaction.\nWe believe that there\u2019s great value to be added to industries that deal with Intellectual Property if you onboard content creators worldwide without any friction and better yet, if they can transact with their fans/customers directly and efficiently like you can with Bitcoin.\nHow has Frostwire changed more recently?\nFrostWire is now 9 years old, it went from being a LimeWire fork into a project of its own. FrostWire is the result of integrating a multitude of Open Source projects; it\u2019s basically a file downloader with built in search capabilities, along with a full featured media player powered by MPlayer.\nFrostWire downloads files from cloud services and from the BitTorrent network. For this purpose we\u2019ve been using the Vuze/Azureus BitTorrent engine, but as of FrostWire 6 (currently in alpha) we\u2019ve removed Azureus completely and we\u2019re now using libtorrent.\nWe were born a Java project, and integrating things like libtorrent in the product have made us create new technology for the java community.\nFor FrostWire 6 we created a full featured libtorrent wrapper API for Java called frostwire-jlibtorrent. https://github.com/frostwire/frostwire-jlibtorrent Our commercial proof of concept for this library will be the release of FrostWire 6, a full featured end user BitTorrent client, now lighter and faster than ever thanks to this \u201cengine\u201d replacing decision.\nWe hope this library will enable other projects, certainly in the enterprise/cloud sector which is heavily serviced by Java technologies, to take a closer look at what the BitTorrent technologies are able to do. Once mature, this will be a powerful library to build products that can benefit from decentralized file sharing.\nDuring those 9 years something interesting happened along the way, and it was the birth of Android. When we got on Android we were the first peer to peer file sharing client ever published on the \u201cAndroid Market\u201d (as I believe it was called at the time), back then we had implemented a new p2p protocol which we had called \u201cmetafrost\u201d. The protocol mimicked the Gnutella Protocol and at the time it was an experiment that was catching exponential attention from Android users that could browse each other\u2019s shared files. However, this didn\u2019t go well with the federal government which had concerns about our default settings for a file sharing app, and they ended up not just auditing our Android app, but also putting very strict rules on how the desktop app was to behave.\nThis led to the hard decision of removing Gnutella support from FrostWire and transforming it into a BitTorrent/Cloud downloader.\nWe\u2019ll soon be releasing an Android version that also enjoys the power of our new frostwire-jlibtorrent client, and we believe this new version should be able to run very well even in very modest hardware equipped Android devices (just by looking at our initial tests and comparing things like memory usage, threads used, battery consumption)\nHow did you come to join OpenBazaar?\nI\u2019ve joined OpenBazaar simply because of the daily anxiety of not having it. I believe OpenBazaar needs to exist. The world of e-commerce is made up of a bunch of walled gardens that don\u2019t talk to each other. Thanks to Bitcoin this can finally change as the payment medium is no longer owned/controlled by a central organization not willing to open up in anyway.\nMy goal with OpenBazaar is to have a standard Smart Contract Protocol that any ecommerce related app/service can use. What this means for FrostWire is still uncertain as the protocol is still far from having an implementation that we can look at and say \u201cwe can actually do this, and that\u201d, but it is in my gut that this protocol will enable us to work on a decentralized music store, a decentralized music store that allows not just for the \u201cPay what you can\u201d business model, but also the more traditional \u201cPay for this track\u201d model, while not ripping artists off 30% plus what labels steal from them after that.\nI think this will be very healthy for the music industry as a whole, especially as technology has allowed for very specific niches to discover the music they actually care about (long tails). If we can pull it for music, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to empower content creators working with film, books, software, etc. to list, and sell their products be it on FrostWire, or on some other OpenBazaar based product.\nAnother interesting thing we started doing recently with FrostWire and Bitcoin to grow our developer team was the addition of tip4commit to our repo. We\u2019re converting all fiat donations into Bitcoin and distributing these to the following projects:\nhttps://github.com/frostwire/frostwire-desktop\nhttps://github.com/frostwire/frostwire-android\nhttps://github.com/frostwire/frostwire-common\nhttps://github.com/frostwire/frostwire-jlibtorrent\nAs a result, the first week we started getting translators from Russia, Croatia, Greece, [and] China to help us with out of date translation files. As of last week we started getting our first contributions to frostwire-android (someone from Azerbaijan) and the beauty of it is that, once the projects are funded, the bitcoins are out of our control. And once a new contribution is merged, the contributor will receive bitcoins almost immediately to their wallet.\nWe\u2019re now seeing 2-4 daily contributions to the projects and making new friends all over the planet.", "year": 2013, "month": 8, "day": 1}

Levine, senior fellow with the Bitcoin Education Project and Editor in Chief and Co-host of Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin! announced his ambitious project code-named \u201cWatershed\u201d (watershed.launchrock.com) in a well received speech, \u201cWin-Win-Win-Win-Win: Rethinking Content Monetization with Bitcoin\u201d with the collaboration of\u00a0Farzad Hashemi.\nThe speech laid out the foundation for a versatile audience supported content exchange system. \u00a0More specifically, Levine told Bitcoin Magazine that Watershed will be \u201cAn open source, free platform for sustainable community ecosystems powered by cryptocurrency.\u201d\nRecently we have witnessed content providers (which I would prefer to call content exchangers) big and small leverage the \u201dcrypto-monetization\u201d of web communities through tipping tools that eliminate so called \u201ctransaction friction\u201d such as \u00a0\nReddit's Bitcointip\n, Terk.co\u2019s \nWordPress Bitcoin Tips Plugin\n, \u00a0Scotty.cc\u2019s \nCoin Widget\n and even \u201cintersertial ad\u201d URL shorteners such as \nCoinUrl\n. \u00a0Watershed take these concepts to the next level.\nLevine described the old \u201cbroken\u201d media model where the audience/media consumer does not have a direct connection to the author:\n\nAdvertisers pay the Platform (i.e. the Website Operator), The Platform pays the Content Creator,\u00a0\nWatershed closes this content exchange gap with an Audience Supported Content system. \u00a0\nHat Tip to Early Thinkers: A Brief Pre-History of Bitcoin Tipping\nFebruary 16th, 2010: Elnora Crater on the \nBitcoin Forum\n BitcoinTalk.org pondered a \u201c\nURI-scheme for bitcoin\n\u201d \u00a0whereby \u201cThe bitcoin addresses could be improved by implementing an \nURI-scheme\n like e.g. \ntorrent magnet links\n....This would allow one to implement \u2018donate buttons\u2019 on homepages, \u2018pay buttons\u2019 on webshops...\u201d\nThe controversial\nBitcoin Needs a \u2018Tip Jar\u2019 Widget system like Flattr\nApril 04, 2011: \nJed\u2019s\n \u201c\nIdea for the killer bitcoin app\n\u201d laid the groundwork for a broad, all-inclusive Bitcoin Tip Jar with a \u201cTwitter tipping system\u201d, \u201cWeb based tipping\u201d, \u201cSMS tipping\u201d and a \u201cForum tipping plugin.\u201d\nSeptember 23, 2011: \nManu Sporny\n explained \u201c\nWhy Tipping has failed\n\u201d on his blog \u201c\nThe Beautiful, Tormented Machine\n\u201d that \u201cStandardizing Payment Links for the Web is not enough \u2013 we must also focus on listing and transacting assets that provide value to people.\u201d \u00a0And further \u201c...the problem is a deeper social issue of paying for unrefined content...\u201d \u00a0Sporny was also a speaker at today's conference \u00a0as the CEO of Digital Bazaar and is the founder of \nPaySwarm\n, \u201cthe world\u2019s first open, Universal Payment Standard for the Web.\u201d\n2013 Bitcoin\u2019s Tipping Point\nOn April 5th, 2013 Scott \u201c\nScotty.cc\n\u201d Sherman announced the release of \nCoin Widget\n on the Bitcoin Forum: \u201c\ncoinwidget.com donation widget - now open source (w/litecoin support)\n.\u201d Coin Widget is a customizable and elegantly simple to use Bitcoin and Litecoin donation widget. It can display the total amount or the total number of tips and provides a QR code for additional donations.\nShortly thereafter, on May 18th 2013, Adam B. Levine gave his seminal speech \n\"Youtube is Broken!: Rethinking Content Monetization with Bitcoin\"\n at the San Jose \u201c\nBitcoin 2013: The Future of Payments\n\u201d Bitcoin Conference.\nAdam\u2019s speech and Scotty.cc\u2019s widget compelled \nDavid Perry of Coding in My Sleep\n to announce on the forum that he was \n\u201cLooking for WordPress plugin (or someone to write one) to bring some of these ideas to fruition.\n\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0\nTerk.co, taking the bull by its horns announced on May 24th, 2013 that \u201cI hate Wordpress development as its architecture is so wrong, but I loved the idea so much that I actually learnt writing Wordpress plugins overnight....This is a result of my all-night work and this is a working plugin that does what {David} described.\u201d \u00a0Terk.co\u2019s \nWordPress Bitcoin Tips Plugin\n was born.\nEnter Watershed\nWorking on these themes and with a grand vision, Levine announced Watershed. \u201cMy focus is not so much on commerce as it is on creating sustainable community,\u201d said Levine.\nWatershed separates the platform from the content that resides on it, transforming the way we create, consume and exchange content. \u00a0In this new paradigm the audience pays for content, the sponsors pay for the platform.\n\nInfluenced by Dr. Conrad Barski\u2019s Cointagion, which utilizes a \u201cReal-time Generation of Bitcoin Addresses for a Web Commerce Site\u201d Levine revealed \u201cOAPUPU\u201d or One Address per Use per User scheme. \u00a0OAPUPU pre-populates a new payment address for each potential user/consumer and tracks and credits payments, tips, donations, subscriptions all without requiring the user to navigate away from the page they are visiting. \u00a0Moreover, advertisers can embed actionable payment mechanisms such as QR codes to enable frictionless e-commerce and e-giving.\nFrom a user privacy vantage point this system appears to one-up legacy services such as PayPal. Like PayPal, individual merchants do not store consumers\u2019 credit card details; However, unlike PayPal there is no money transmitter service (i.e. PayPal) requiring you to park your financial details either. This is a direct widget to Bitcoin Wallet (to Block Chain) to merchant and content provider exchange.\nIn a metrical rhythm Levine described how he envisions community supported content where information consumers tip authors for content on topics they are passionate about. This virtuous cycle of tipping,\nleads to\ncontent creators wanting to service those needs\nresults in\nincreased search rankings\nleading to\nmore audience\nmeaning\nthere are more people willing to tip\nleads to\nmore/better content creators creating content\nleads to\nbetter search results\nresulting in\nmore audience\nWatershed will bridge the creator/audience divide by enabling a new level of intimacy:\n\u201cContent creators already have a direct connection to their audience, the problem is until Cryptocurrencies there was never an easy and borderless connection from the audience back to that creator. \u00a0The audience compensates very indirectly by buying from site advertisers, which funds the site and which might trickle down to the creator, but there are two basically unrelated and unnecessary parties involved...By separating the platform from the content that lives on it, you dramatically simplify things.\u201c\nQuality is: Win, Win, Win Win, Win:\nResults Based Pay for Creators - Win\nBetter Content for Audience - Win\nBetter Growth for Platform - Win\nMore Eyeballs for Advertisers - Win\nBetter Content - Win\nBrave New Widget World\nThis is not your one size fits all Starbucks barista tipping jar. Tip splitting will divide tips into multiple addresses. \u00a0For example a percentage of the tip can go to charity. Affiliate syndication will enable creators to embed referral commissions into content, incentivizing syndication and social media distribution.\neCommerce Evolution\nAnnounced was WindowShop which will take the Cointagion concept and reinvent display advertising. Advertising will directly engage the consumer rather than a tiered multi-click process. \nThree clicks\n becomes hyper-click. This will be the driving force behind a new type of impulse shopping. As a real world comparison, I was reminded of \nTesco Homeplus Subway Virtual Store\n and \nPeaPod Virtual Shelf\n. \u00a0\nI was excited to learn about trustless and riskless live auction integration into Watershed. Live auctions will use blockchain escrow. On-chain escrow will enable refunds (i.e. release of escrow) without fees. \u00a0The stroke of genius is that since the money is not held by the merchant or platform, but rather by the \nblockchain\n itself, this reduces if not eliminates fiduciary risk and likely the regulatory compliance requirements (e.g. money transmitter licenses) for facilitating escrow transactions. \u00a0However, this requires a new way of thinking about auctions in general. Bidders would have their funds tied up in escrow until the conclusion of the auction. A paradigm shift in the way online auction can be conducted by completely removing dead beat and hoax bidders out of the equation. Gone are the days when sellers would state \u201cserious bidders only\u201d\n\n\nMoving Forward\nLevine\u2019s speech at San Jose inspired other to act. With the announcement in New York, Levine anticipates spearheading Watershed and he told Bitcoin Magazine he anticipates running its operations as a not for profit. Watershed is an ambitious and broad proposal that is not yet funded. Collaborators are actively being sought to engage project Watershed. Potential developers should contact Levine with proposals.\nLevine boldly stated, \u201cRich, cryptocurrency advertising turns every community platform into a mini-kickstarter - Pick the community or niche that should be your primary audience and conduct that campaign right there in an advertising slot.\u201d \u00a0\nCan Watershed be the Kickstarter for the \n\u201cother 6.5 Billion people?\n\u201d\nWatershed with its multifaceted approach needs to gain enough momentum to vault ahead of maturing companies such as Flattr and newcomers such as Pikapay & BitCredits.io. Flattr describes itself as the \"easiest way to support creators...give microdonations when you 'Like,' 'Favorite' & 'Star' ..support creators directly on services you use.\" Flattr, more than three years strong \nrecently added Bitcoin Support\n. PikaPay with a more narrow focus is now \nMicrofunding Over Twitter.\nBitCredits.io\nBitcoinstarter.\nI\u2019ve had the privilege of working with Adam as a writer for Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin! He has a creative drive and is passionate for his work. If anyone can bring together a project of this magnitude I know it will be him.\n", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 31}

The claim is that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cused\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bitcoin addresses \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that is, addresses which have both received and sent bitcoins, have their corresponding public key exposed on the blockchain, allowing quantum-enabled adversaries to break Bitcoin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s elliptic curve cryptography, whereas \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunused\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bitcoin addresses, which may have received bitcoins but have never been spent from, do not have their public keys exposed, allowing them to benefit from the much stronger cryptographic guarantees of SHA256 and RIPEMD-160. As long as the first transaction spending from any Bitcoin address empties out all of the funds stored in that address to new addresses as change, the theory goes, Bitcoin should remain just as secure as before. In fact, since most wallets already try not to reuse addresses to increase privacy, for most users only minor software changes would be needed to satisfy the more stringent security condition, so adapting to quantum computing would be a breeze. This argument has been made by many people in the Bitcoin community, notably including myself. In reality, however, the argument has a fatal flaw.\nHashes and Curves\n\nFirst, the technical background. In a Bitcoin user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wallet, each of that user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own Bitcoin addresses is represented by three distinct numbers: a private key, a public key and the address itself. The public key is derived from the private key by elliptic curve multiplication, and, given only classical computers like those that exist today, recovering the private key from a public key is essentially impossible. The address is derived from the public key by a series of three steps: applying the SHA256 hash function to the public key, applying the RIPEMD-160 hash function to that and finally adding a value called a checksum for error correction purposes (so that if you accidentally mistype a single character when sending to a Bitcoin address your money does not disappear into a black hole). The point of hash functions is that, just like elliptic curve multiplication, they are computationally infeasible to reverse; given an address, there is no way, aside from the brute force approach of trying all possible public keys, to find the public key that the address is derived from.\nQuantum computers have two major tools that make them superior to classical computers in breaking cryptography: Shor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s algorithm and Grover\\xe2\\x80\\x99s algorithm. Shor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s algorithm is mainly useful for factoring numbers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for example, given the number 1728499, figuring out that the number is composed of the factors 1129 * 1531. With seven-digit numbers, the problem can even be solved on paper with enough patience, but if the numbers are hundreds of digits long quantum computers are required. In fact, the difficulty of factoring very long numbers is the basis of RSA, the oldest public key encryption algorithm and one still in use today. Grover\\xe2\\x80\\x99s algorithm is far more generic \\xe2\\x80\\x93 given a list of numbers and a mathematical property, it can figure out which one of those numbers satisfies the property. A modified version of Shor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s algorithm can crack elliptic curve cryptography as well, and Grover\\xe2\\x80\\x99s algorithm attacks basically anything, including SHA256 and RIPEMD-160.\nHowever, the two algorithms differ drastically in just how efficient they are. Shor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s algorithm reduces the runtime of cracking elliptic curve cryptography from O(2k/2) to O(k3) \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that is to say, since Bitcoin private keys are 256 bits long, the number of computational steps needed to crack them goes down from 340 trillion trillion trillion to a few hundred million at most. Grover\\xe2\\x80\\x99s algorithm, on the other hand, does not offer anything close to so drastic a speedup. Rather, it simply provides a modest reduction from O(2k) to O(2k/2). In the case of RIPEMD-160, the weaker of the two hashes used to create a Bitcoin address, this means that the number of steps needed to recover a public key from an address goes down from 1.4 trillion trillion trillion trillion to \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 1.2 trillion trillion. Somewhat easier, but still thankfully impractical. As described above, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cused\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bitcoin addresses from have an exposed public key, so it is the easy challenge of cracking elliptic curve cryptography with Shor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s algorithm that is the bottleneck. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUnused\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bitcoin addresses, on the other hand, expose only the address itself, so it is the RIPEMD-160 Grover problem that poses the weakened, but still insurmountable, challenge.\nSo What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the Problem?\nHere is where the above logic goes wrong. Everything about quantum computers in the above two paragraphs is, given public knowledge, is essentially correct, and if a Bitcoin address is truly unused, then indeed, even given quantum computers, any bitcoins lying inside are fine. However, the challenge is, how do you actually spend the funds? In order to release the bitcoins sent to that address, it is necessary to create a Bitcoin transaction, and that transaction must include a signature and a public key to verify that it was the owner of the private key that signed it. However, here lies the problem. By making that transaction, you have just released all of the information that anyone with a quantum computer needs to fully impersonate you, right on the spot. Without quantum computing, this is impossible, as Bitcoin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s elliptic curve signatures only have enough information to recover the public key, not the private key. With quantum computing, elliptic curve signatures are as flimsy as a digital sheet of paper.\nIf you send a transaction spending all 100 BTC in address 13ign, with 10 BTC going to 1v1tal to pay for goods and 90 BTC change going back to your new address at 1mcqmmnx, the first node that you send the transaction to can replace the change address with whatever they want, recover the private key from your public key, and forge your signature. The only way to get around the problem is essentially to send the transaction directly to a mining pool, like BTCGuild or Slush, and hope that the mining pool will be honest and place the transaction directly into the blockchain. Even then, however, you are vulnerable to a Finney attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a dishonest miner can forge your signature, create a valid block containing his forged transaction continuing the blockchain from one before the most recent block (the one containing your transaction), and, since the lengths of the old and new blockchains would then be equal, the attacker would have a 50% chance of his block taking precedence. Thus, safe transactions are essentially impossible.\nLamport Signatures: A Solution\n\n\n\nBasically, the purpose of hash functions is to provide us with the mathematical equivalent of a lock. Publishing the hash of a value is similar to putting out a lock in public, and releasing the original value is like opening the lock. However, once the lock is open, it cannot be closed again. The problem is, however, that locks by themselves cannot make a secure digital signature scheme. What elliptic curve cryptography provides, and SHA256 and RIPEMD-160 do not, is a way of proving that you have the secret value behind a mathematical lock, and attaching this proof to a specific message, without revealing the original value or even making the proof valid for any other message than the one you attached. In Bitcoin, the message in question is a transaction. When your Bitcoin client sends a transaction to the network, what it is really doing is sending a mathematical proof of the following fact: this transaction, which states that I am sending this amount of money to this address, was constructed by someone in possession of the private key behind the Bitcoin address I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sending from. This is the basis for the transactional side of Bitcoin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s security.\nHowever, there is a construction that enables us to solve this problem without RSA, elliptic curves or any other traditional public-key cryptographic system: Lamport signatures. A Lamport signature is a one-time signature that gets around the lockbox problem in the following way: there are multiple locks, and it is the content of the message (or rather, the hash of the message) that determines which locks need to be opened. If someone tries to forge your message, it is almost certain (read: the sun will run out of hydrogen before the other scenario happens) that the Lamport signature scheme will require them to open at least one lock that you did not open already \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which they, lacking the unreleased secret values, will not be able to do.\nHow Lamport Signatures Work, In DetailLamport signatures may seem technically complex, but because they only have one ingredient \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the hash function (in this case, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll use RIPEMD-160) they are actually one of the most accessible cryptographic protocols for the average person to understand. The algorithm works as follows:Generate 160 pairs of 160-bit random numbers (you can make them all from a single seed with RIPEMD-160: RIPEMD-160(seed+\\xe2\\x80\\x9d1\\xe2\\x80\\xb3), RIPEMD-160(seed+\\xe2\\x80\\x9d2\\xe2\\x80\\xb3), etc). These values, or in some implementation the seed used to generate them, are your private key.Hash all of the random numbers (eg. with RIPEMD-160), and publish all 160 pairs of hashes. These are your public key, and will be needed by the network to later verify your signature.To sign a message, calculate the RIPEMD-160 hash of the message, and then depending on each bit of the hash release the secret number behind the first or second hash in each pair. If the bit is zero, open the first hash, and if the bit is one open the second hash.\nUnder this scheme, a Bitcoin address will still be the SHA256+RIPEMD-160 hash of the public key; the only difference is that the public key will consist of 320 hashes rather than an elliptic curve point. A transaction will include the public key and the signature, just like today, and, once again just like today, verifiers will check that the public key matches the address and the signature matches the message and the public key. The signatures are unforgeable; even with Grover\\xe2\\x80\\x99s algorithm, it will take 280steps for an adversary to construct a fraudulent transaction that requires them to reveal the exact same 160 secret numbers that you already revealed, or an adversary can take 280* 80 steps to simply crack all the hashes. Both numbers are in the trillions of trillions of computations.\nThe only change in behavior that will be needed is for people to start using addresses only once; after two uses, the security of the Lamport scheme drops to 240, a value which might still be safe against quantum computers at first, but only barely, and after three uses it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s as weak as elliptic curve cryptography. Theoretically, however, even this can be partially overcome; the Merkle signature scheme builds off of Lamport\\xe2\\x80\\x99s idea to create signatures which can be used tens or hundreds, or potentially even thousands, of times before the private key needs to be retired. The only limit to the maximum number of transactions per address is basically a question of limiting blockchain bloat.\nGiven what is currently public knowledge, quantum computers are still far away; the most powerful quantum computer to date managed to use Shor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s algorithm to factor the number 21. However, sudden advances are always possible, and we always need to have a plan of what we can do if Edward Snowden decides to leak out that the NSA has fully functional quantum computers hiding in a secret data center. We probably cannot handle such a sudden event, but we certainly can handle cases where we get even a month of advance warning. The solution is this: as soon as a quantum pre-emergency is declared, everyone should move their wealth into a 1-of-2 multisignature transaction between an unused, old-style, Bitcoin address, and an address generated with the new Lamport scheme. Then, developers should quickly create the Lamport patch for as many Bitcoin clients as possible and push for everyone to upgrade. If the whole process is done within weeks, then by the time quantum computers become a threat the bulk of people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bitcoins will be in new-style Lamport addresses and will be safe. For those who still have their wealth in old-style addresses by then (unused old-style addresses that is; by that point coins in used old-style addresses could trivially be stolen), a few established organizations will agree to serve as trusted nodes, using the Merkle signature scheme to add an additional signature to transactions sending from old-style addresses to new-style addresses. To prevent network fraud and Finney attacks, the new Bitcoin rules would require all transactions from old to new after a certain point to be signed by these authorities. The authority system will introduce centralization, but it will only be a temporary emergency measure, and after a few years the system can be retired entirely. From there, we lick our wounds, pick up our losses and move on to enjoy some of the more wonderful things that quantum computing has to offer.", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 31}

Coinpunk is a project led by veteran startup founder Kyle Drake to build an open source web-based wallet service that can be run by any user, by developers to build their own wallet service, or organizations wanting to run their own Bitcoin \u201ccredit unions\u201d.\nThe announcement is part of the Foundation\u2019s Q2 Grant Award, which is an ongoing effort to improve the open source ecosystem of Bitcoin by providing funding to help improve the tools available for people to work with Bitcoin. The first grants were for Q1, which included important funding for improvements to Bitcoin testing infrastructure.\n\u201cThe main tenet of Bitcoin is that decentralization is what drives its soundness\u201d, said Kyle. \u201cBut what we\u2019ve seen recently is an ecosystem where web wallets are run by a few US/UK based players. That\u2019s similar to the way GMail works for email, which isn\u2019t a bad thing, but it\u2019s not for everyone. If Bitcoin wants to maintain its goal of being decentralized, there needs to be a rich abundance of choices, and web wallet services need to be available to different organizations and countries.\u201d Kyle added that it is the implications on banking that interests him the most. \u201cInstead of having big banks and financial groups control your money, you get Bitcoin owners being their own banks, investing in only the things they want to invest in, and not being charged with mystery fees or being exposed to fraud and malinvestment of funds.\u201d\nKyle noted there is currently a version of Coinpunk available, but that he\u2019s currently in the process of building a major new version. \u201cI\u2019m providing the option to move the security from the server to the browser side, which makes the server less like a bank that holds your money, and more like a safety deposit box it can\u2019t open, which increases trustability. I\u2019m also focusing on building the tools developers need to make custom wallet services for solving specific problems or running exchanges in non-US countries with this technology.\u201d\nKyle isn\u2019t sure when the project will be finished, noting that he wants the project to be stable before releasing the new version, but hopes to have a release available by the end of late summer. \u201cIt\u2019s a very ambitious project that\u2019s going to affect a lot of people, and I want to make sure we get things right. We want to provide a rich set of options and developer tools, so we can enable a web wallet ecosystem for working with Bitcoin that hopefully becomes a strong community resource.\u201d\nThe next grant deadline for Q3 proposals will be Friday, September 20th. Information on submitting grant proposals can be found on the Bitcoin Foundation blog.\nBitcoin Magazine had the privilege of interview Coinpunk veteran startup founder Kyle Drake.\n\nBitcoin Magazine : When did you first hear about and get involved in the Bitcoin currency?\nKyle Drake:I first heard about Bitcoin a few years ago, and it immediately made sense to me what it was trying to do, and I\u2019ve been following it pretty closely ever since. I\u2019ve always been fascinated by economics, and have spent a lot of time reading about the effects of commodity money, especially in edge cases (like how cigarettes are used in prisons as a currency, and sea shells were used in antiquity). These edge cases emphasize a natural way that humans tend to deal with resource problems in a microcosmic, decentralized way. Having that background allowed me to quickly realize that Bitcoin was going to be the replacement and improvement for a lot of centralized financial systems, and that got me interested.\nThe current Bitcoin climate reminds me a lot of the Homebrew Computer Club days in the 70s, when there were passionate idealists working on side projects that ended up creating the most culturally liberating technology in the world: the personal computer. And I see Bitcoin as a logical extension of that pioneering work: Banks are today\u2019s mainframes, and Bitcoin is the financial version of the personal computer. Centralized, versus decentralized. Being a bank stops being this expensive thing only a few large corporations can do \u2013 it becomes something everybody can do.\nNot everybody \u201cgets\u201d Bitcoin yet, just like people didn\u2019t \u201cgot\u201d personal computers back then, when it was mainly the purview of hackers like Steve Wozniak and idealistic visionaries like Stewart Brand. But I am seeing the potential of Bitcoin for the exact same reasons they had for the personal computer, and in time I think the profound nature of Bitcoin will be obvious to everyone. I think we\u2019re on the ground floor of something very important here, and I want to help contribute to that.\nIn the United States, the mortgage crisis and the Occupy movement really brought the problems with our banking system to the forefront, and you had people finally starting to look at their banks, that were creating random fines and fees, investing poorly, kicking people out of their homes without giving them a fair chance, and say \u201cI don\u2019t agree with what you\u2019re doing\u201d. I see the opportunity for Bitcoin to help build a more ethical banking system, that gives customers more choice and control over their money, that isn\u2019t filled with arbitrary fees and restrictions, and that deals with the massive fraud problem that our banking system has completely failed to address with credit cards and wire transfers.\nBM: When did you first get the idea for Coinpunk and what inspired you to create the site?\nKD: I\u2019ve always been interested in the wallet side of the problem, because I see wallets as the natural evolution of a bank account.\nI wanted to run my own Bitcoin wallet service, so I looked around for open source solutions and couldn\u2019t find one. This was concerning, because I believed if there wasn\u2019t a good open source option, it might lead to situation where all the wallets become centrally controlled by a few entities, which could bring us right back to many of the problems with our current banking system.\nI\u2019m not against commercial wallet services, I think they are good (and play a role similar to that of Google Mail for email). But we need open source alternatives, too, so that we improve upon Bitcoin\u2019s biggest strength: decentralization. If email only worked through Google Mail and Hotmail, it wouldn\u2019t be very good.\nBM: Were there any preexisting businesses that inspired you to create Coinpunk?\nKD: All of the current wallet services have been an inspiration of sorts, because I was able to see how they approached the problem, and distill that into something that I thought would work well for this project. There\u2019s really nothing wrong with the existing wallet services, most of them are great. They\u2019re just not fully open source, and are based in specific countries.\nI wanted to make a project for people wanting to run and build their own wallet service, in the same light as projects like buttercoin (an open source Bitcoin exchange platform). I don\u2019t see Coinpunk as competing with commercial wallet services. In fact, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they find parts of the project useful for their work. Everybody\u2019s helping each other out, and that\u2019s a very positive thing for the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nBM: Where do you see Coinpunk going in a year?\nKD: Coinpunk is going to be a fully-featured wallet service, and I hope to see people start to use it to solve real-world problems.\nI\u2019m expecting to see a lot of usage in interesting ways, such as with hardware wallets like BitSafe (which Butterfly Labs is currently working on). I\u2019m also very interested in seeing Coinpunk used in regional exchange and wallet services that help Bitcoin adoption in countries with bad currency problems (like Argentina). Bitcoin could really be a lifeboat for people in countries with high inflation rates like Argentina and Venezuela, and I hope Coinpunk gets to play a role there.\nBM: What makes your new wallet stand out in comparison to other wallets for the Bitcoin currency?\nKD: Coinpunk is the only fully open-source web wallet service available. That\u2019s its main differentiation right now, but I expect that it will stand out in other ways in the future as we start adding more functionality.\nBM: What are your suggestions for individuals hoping to start an open source project like yours?\nKD: Just do it! The Bitcoin development community is very friendly, open and collaborative. There is a lot of support for people working on improving the ecosystem and protecting our legal rights with groups like the Bitcoin Foundation, and there\u2019s a lot of important and interesting problems that need to be solved. This isn\u2019t another stupid photo sharing app: We know we\u2019re changing the world, and everybody is excited about it. It\u2019s a lot of fun.\nBM: If I am a merchant looking to sell through your site, how can I get started?\nKD: Coinpunk might support some basic bitcoin-to-bitcoin purchase services in the future, and will have an API to help facilitate development, but I would strongly recommend using a merchant-specific service like BitPay for now. They have been spending a lot of time working on making it easy for people, are way more affordable (and less fraud prone) than credit cards, and can do conversions to your local currency for you automatically.", "year": 2013, "month": 8, "day": 3}
{"title": "Coinforest: The Cheaper In Bitcoin Movement Takes Another Step Forward", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/coinforest-the-cheaper-in-bitcoin-movement-takes-another-step-forward-1375481372/", "birthday": "Aug 2, 2013  6:09 PM EST", "date": "2013-08-02 23:09:00", "content": "One of the aspects of the modern consumer economy that Bitcoin users often miss out on is that of special deals, where customers can, whether through acquiring rewards points, gathering coupons or signing up for special programs, occasionally get select products at rock-bottom prices. Loyalty programs like Air Miles let people gather points and eventually receive goods like plane tickets at a heavily discounted prices or for free, some credit cards give 1-3% cash back to the customer (ultimately at the merchant\u2019s expense), and programs like Groupon let customers go to select merchants and receive up to 75% off with no prior commitment. These kinds of programs serve a valuable role in the economy; sometimes, they are useful as marketing tools, giving everyone access to a small quantity of their product in order to spread the word about their business and give people a chance to see what they are about, at other times they are a form of price discrimination, giving discounts to people who cannot afford to pay as much, and finally they are often used by stores as a way of rapidly getting rid of a product that they have too much of in stock and want to sell.\nIn the Bitcoin economy, such deals are unfortunately hard to find. There are sites like the BitcoinStore and BTCTrip that sell things relatively cheaply, but the sort of heavy, twenty to eighty percent, discounts that traditional discount programs offer are simply not availbale. Fortunately, that is soon about to change. Coinforest is a new company that aims to provide a very specific kind of discount program, known as group buying, to the Bitcoin community, and has just opened its first deal today. Group buying is a system where a centralized service negotiates with a company to offer a large discount on a particular item if enough people are willing to buy it. The service then publicly announces the deal, and asks for anyone interested to sign up. If enough people sign up, the deal goes through, and customers are able to receive their product from the merchant at the low price; otherwise, everyone\u2019s money is refunded.\nAside from the marketing and promotional aspect, group buying is good for merchants because it allows them to sell a product that requires mass production to efficiently produce without maintaining a large stock. The group buying arrangement gathers a large group of customers to buy a given product on the same day, allowing the producer to make all of the products at the same time and ship them off immediately. If there are not enough customers for economies of scale to kick in, the deal simply does not happen. For online services, the situation is similar, except the mass production process is replaced by expenses like hiring an additional employee for customer support or upgrading one\u2019s servers; more important in those cases, however, is the marketing aspect.\nCoinforest was originally founded by John Mardlin, an entrepreneur with a background in business development and marketing software-as-a-service products. The company itself is based in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, and the company\u2019s business development manager Brandon Gains is also involved in several tech startups in the region. \u201cWe\u2019re driven by our desire to grow the bitcoin economy,\u201d Gains explains, \u201cBitcoin, and cryptocurrencies in general.\u201d So far, there are plenty of people developing Bitcoin projects, but the number of people actually interested in buying bitcoins is still relatively small. Short term discounts, Gains believes, have the power to change that. \u201cCoinForest can\u2019t create a whole new product and then only sell it for BTC,\u201d Gains adds, \u201cbut we can create a temporary situation, where the only way to get a certain item for a certain price is with bitcoin. Our ultimate goal is to be the reason that many people get their first bitcoins.\u201d\nRight now, Coinforest has one active deal with the Bitcoin T-shirt vendor shirtoshi.com, as well as many others which the company is not willing to disclose at this time. In general, Coinforest is targeting Bitcoin-related goods and services, 3D printing services, equipment for makers, online education, tools and services for building software and services for startups and online businesses. Coinforest\u2019s pitch is that by offering a deal exclusively in Bitcoin the company is targeting a strong early-adopter community and a successful deal can be a great public relations opportunity for gathering media attention. For businesses, Coinforest also has another attraction: they can test the waters accepting Bitcoin without actually setting anything up. Coinforest collects the bitcoins themselves, and is willing to pay out merchants in fiat \u2013 saving businesses both the effort of integrating a new payment system and 2.9% credit card fees. If the deal proves successful, the business can integrate a proper Bitcoin payments platform, and have an array of Bitcoin customers already waiting for them.\nIn the future, Coinforest intends to continually expand their range of offerings and add new features; once the company is comfortable with the success of its business model, a built-in escrow system using BTCRow will be one of the first new features on the horizon. Gathering more businesses and better deals, however, is a higher priority for now.\nCheaper in Bitcoin\nCoinforest is only part of a larger movement to get merchants to not just accept Bitcoin, but also to sell goods cheaper in Bitcoin. Some Bitcoin-only businesses, like BitcoinStore and BTCTrip, offer very favorable deals to Bitcoin users already, but the goal here is to convince even business owners that do not quite consider themselves Bitcoiners first and business owners second to do the same. That is to say, merchants should offer the same products to Bitcoin and fiat currency users, but specifically offer a price of, perhaps, $12.99 for fiat and $11.99 in BTC. There are several reasons to do that. First, when a business accepts Bitcoin for a transaction they do not have to worry about fraud, chargebacks or transaction fees (above 0.99% for BitPay if applicable or 0.0001 BTC for a standard Bitcoin transaction). Second, businesses might want to pay their own employees, suppliers or contractors in Bitcoin; this is particularly attractive if they need to make the payments across international borders.\nThere is also another interesting argument for offering low prices in Bitcoin, one that is particularly attractive to sellers of zero-marginal-cost goods like digital downloads (eg. songs, movies, e-books). The argument is this: when a customer pays for a product, the customer is not just paying the listed price; rather, they are also paying the hidden \u201ctransaction cost\u201d of having to enter their credit card details and provide their personal information. This cost is the same regardless of whether the good in question costs 49 dollars or 49 cents. The result of this hidden cost is that it dampens the effectiveness of offering low prices. For example, imagine that a company is offering e-books for download at $0.99 each. Should the company drop the price to $0.49 each? The standard answer is, if the price drop brings at least twice as many customers in, then yes. In reality, there are distorting factors, as authors naturally want to get their work out to more people if possible both for marketing and altruistic reasons, but these discrepancies do not overturn the fundamental validity of this argument.\nNow, imagine that the \u201chidden transaction cost\u201d described above is something that consumers value at $1. Will a de-facto price drop from $1.99 to $1.49 bring enough customers in to justify the reduced price? Probably not. However, buying with Bitcoin is more efficient than buying with a credit card; if you have a smartphone wallet, a scanning a QR code and clicking \u201cSend\u201d is all you need. Browser extensions even exist that let you pay with Bitcoin directly from your browser. Finally, when making a Bitcoin transaction much less privacy is lost. If this drops the \u201chidden transaction cost\u201d to $0.20, you are now dealing with a de-facto price drop of $1.19 to $0.69 \u2013 a considerably larger price drop in proportion, and thus one that is more likely to convince enough extra customers to buy to justify the fifty-percent revenue loss on each one. Thus, for that particular e-book store, offering books for $0.99 in fiat and $0.49 in Bitcoin may actually be the best strategy. Most of the time, the discount justified by this reasoning will not be quite so drastic, but twenty or thirty percent off with BTC is certainly quite reasonable.\nFor the success of the Bitcoin economy in general, promoting the \u201ccheaper in Bitcoin\u201d movement is simply crucial. Bitcoin has a considerable number of merchants accepting it \u2013 very few if you simply browse randomly, but enough that an increasing number of people are living their entire lives with it. But what the Bitcoin economy also needs is consumers. Right now, in many parts of the world, including the United States, bitcoins are unfortunately difficult to acquire; so much so, that in-person meetups are becoming an increasingly popular way to buy and sell them. Merchants offering goods cheaper in Bitcoin will help bring some of the advantages that Bitcoin offers to the consumer as well.", "year": 2013, "month": 8, "day": 2}

The site offered a level of convenience unmatched by any Bitcoin gambling site \u2013 indeed, any online gambling site regardless of payment method, in history: users send money to a Bitcoin address, and if they win they immediately get more money back. The site was an instant hit, rapidly growing to such a point that roughly 50% of all transactions on the Bitcoin network were to or from its addresses. By the beginning of 2013, the site was earning over $300,000 per month, and even as the price of Bitcoin began its meteoric rise at the start of the year the value of the site\u2019s BTC-denominated shares barely budged.\nNow, however, Bitcoin gambling is growing to be much more than just SatoshiDice. Of couse, many old-time gambling sites like BitZino and Seals with Clubs have been providing alternatives to SatoshiDice all along, but in the opening months of 2013 the massive success of Erik Voorhees\u2019 juggernaut has prompted dozens of people to come up with alternatives. We now have the roulette-style wheel games SatoshiCircle and most recently BitcoinSpin, the minefield Satoshi Karoshi, the SatoshiDice clone SuzukiDice offering half the fees of the original, and the lottery BitMillions, and new sites are opening practically every week. What is more interesting than just the number of sites, however, is that so many of these second-tier gambling sites are seeing large amounts of bets and attention \u2013 such large amounts, in fact, that it may no longer be appropriate to call them second tier.\nCase Study: JustDice\n\nJustDice is a gambling site that first opened in June 2013, offering a form of gameplay similar to SatoshiDice, but using a more traditional deposit and withdraw system instead of requiring users to make a transaction for each bet. Some find SatoshiDice\u2019s \u201ctransactions are bets\u201d approach highly convenient, but it is not for everyone; some dislike it because they want to make many bets at a time and sending a transaction each time is actually less efficient than clicking a button (both in time spent and transaction fees), and others criticize it for its impact on the Bitcoin system as a whole \u2013 specifically, for \u201cpolluting\u201d the blockchain. SatoshiDice\u2019s addresses are currently responsible for roughly a quarter of all transactions that have ever taken place, adding over two gigabytes to the amount of storage space that every fully participating Bitcoin node needs to operate. JustDice, on the other hand, contributes to blockchain bloat only when users deposit and withdraw. Finally, JustDice also seeks to outcompete SatoshiDice on the house edge: while SatoshiDice takes an average of 1.9% from all bets as profit, JustDice is calibrated to take 1%, making gambling on JustDice twice as cheap.\nTo play JustDice, you only need to click \u201cDeposit\u201d to get a Bitcoin address to deposit money, send the funds and wait 1 confirmation (usually 0-15 minutes) for the funds to be credited into one\u2019s account. From there you are free to make bets as often as desired. There is a field which allows users set the exact bet amount and winning percentage that they want, and clicking a button is all it takes to make a bet. Withdrawing is equally as simple: just click the Withdraw button, enter and amount and Bitcoin address, and you\u2019re done. But JustDice also has another feature up its sleeve, and one that no other site before it has implemented nearly as elegantly: on-site investing. When you deposit to JustDice, you have the option of adding a portion of your funds to the bankroll, allowing the site to use it to pay out unexpected very large wins if necessary. The more investors the site has, the higher it can safely raise its maximum bet, allowing it to earn greater profits. In exchange, you get a proportional share of whatever profits the site makes \u2013 although there is a risk, as if the site loses money you lose too. To cash out your earnings, simply click withdraw and you\u2019re done. No BitFunder shares or stock trading required.\nJustDice has proven to be highly successful, earning over 2800 BTC of profit after little over less than two months of operation \u2013 roughly half the earnings of SatoshiDice, and the site has already seen over forty million bets \u2013 far more than SatoshiDice, although the fact that JustDice is optimized for making a large number of bets one after the other does mean that this is not a very fair comparison. With 40,000 BTC invested, JustDice\u2019s market capitalization currently stands at roughly one third of that of SatoshiDice when the site sold itself earlier in July.\nCase Study: SatoshiCircle\n\nSatoshiCircle is a roulette-style wheel game first launched in March 2013 by a team of developers based in Toronto, Canada. The gameplay of SatoshiCircle is simple. When you go to the site for the first time, you are redirected to a personal URL that serves as the key to your account. You can deposit bitcoins to your account by sending money to your personal deposit address, and SatoshiCircle even provides a QR code to make the process easier for players with mobile wallets. The money arrives instantly (for security, it\u2019s the withdrawals that require 2 confirmations). Once you have money in your account, you can then select the amount that you want to bet and click \u201cSpin\u201d. Five seconds later, the spinner stops and depending on where the spinner lands you receive either none, 25%, 150%, 200% or 300% of the money you bet. Withdrawing is simple \u2013 just click \u201cWithdraw Bitcoins\u201d from the menu at the top of the screen, and you will see a form where you can either click on a Bitcoin address you used to deposit to the site, or enter your own. And that\u2019s all there is to it.\nWhere SatoshiCircle particularly distinguishes itself, however, is in its bells and whistles. \u201cThe idea,\u201d the site\u2019s founder explains, \u201cwas for a very clean-looking, easy to play, interactive game, which was lacking in the Bitcoin community. There was no gameplay in SatoshiDice, and we wanted to make it interesting and exciting.\u201d Every time you make a bet, in addition to winning and losing bitcoins you also earn a certain number of points. Points can also be earned for making streaks, such as getting nine winning spins in a row. As soon as you reach a certain threshold of points, you unlock additional features such as alternative spinning wheels. One bonus wheel, for example, is essentially a coin flip between getting double one\u2019s bet and losing it, with one small sliver returning .7x to provide the 1.76% house edge, and another wheel offers a 15x jackpot. Whenever you receive a particularly large win on any of the wheels, a congratulatory graphic depending on which wheel the bet was made on appears on screen \u2013 themed penguins on the default wheel, flying UFOs on another; play the game yourself to find out the rest! Aside from the bonus wheels, points have other applications; there are monthly Bitcoin draws based on reward points as well as global leaderboards to show who has the most points. Finally, and perhaps most importantly of all, SatoshiCircle actually has sound effects.\nThe site started earning a profit as soon as it launched, earning roughly 20 BTC its first week and then increasing to 50 BTC during the second week \u2013 a rate which the site has kept up ever since, now boasting total cumulative earnings of over 700 BTC since its launch. The site began growing exponentially at the beginning of May, but the growth was unfortunately stunted when both the Bitcoin price chart site ClarkMoody and Reddit stopped accepting gambling sites (Reddit has always had a policy prohibiting them; the site simply stepped up its vigilance in enforcing the ban). Fortunately, SatoshiCircle retained many of its initial customers, and recently its revenue has even begun picking up once again. Last week, SatoshiCircle passed SatoshiDice in the total number of bets made \u2013 despite the fact that the site has only been around a quarter as long as its competitor (although, like JustDice, the comparison is not quite fair because SatoshiCircle\u2019s deposit mechanism is better suited for a large number of bets one after the other, while SatoshiDice\u2019s design targets fewer and larger bets). Today, the site is continuing to grow quickly, seeing 15 new players and 120,000 spins (from new and old players combined) every day.\nThe company has plans to expand into the virtual slot machine industry as well with \u201cSatoshi Sevens\u201d, a slot machine game including a feature known as a \u201cprogressive jackpot\u201d. A portion of all house commissions will go into a special pool, and anyone who wins the best possible result in the game with the maximum bet of 0.01 BTC will receive all of the funds accumulated in the pool. Those who win that result with a smaller bet will not get the jackpot, but will receive 250x their money back.\nListings and Directories\n\nBecause many countries\u2019 laws, including those of the US, prohibit advertising gambling, the greatest challenge that gambling sites of all shapes and sizes face is that of making themselves known. Fortunately, the Bitcoin community has come up with some innovative solutions. Bitcointalk forum member Mem has created Mem\u2019s Bitcoin Gambling List, a directory of gambling sites with nearly a hundred entries from categories ranging from lotteries to dice games to video poker. The list is particularly helpful because it includes a rating system, showing which sites have responsive admins, which have ongoing payout issues and which are outright scams.\nThe most interesting rating of all is \u201cconsidered mathematically honest\u201d \u2013 in other words, provably fair. Provable fairness is an innovation in the Bitcoin gambling industry which basically means that sites publicly release their algorithms as well as cryptographic commitments to the secret data used to power the random number generators determining which bets win and which bets lose. This ensures that if the site attempts to cheat, the fact will become obvious at the end of the day when the site is expected to reveal the secret data for the day. If the site cheated on any single bet, users can independently verify the outcome of the bet by running the random number generator with the no longer secret data themselves and notice the discrepancy, and if the site tries to change the underlying secret data after the fact the cryptographic commitment will reveal this as well. Thus, users can be sure that their chances of winning are exactly as advertised. Mem personally screens websites to verify their provable fairness, and at times even makes specific demands for sites to modify their interface or algorithms before giving them the coveted \u201cconsidered mathematically honest\u201d rating. His list is so highly regarded that gambling site operators usually comply.\nAnother site that will soon be making a more formal launch is betswithbitcoin.com, more traditional, ad-supported directory. A large portion of the site\u2019s revenue will be donated to charity, and individual sites have the opportunity to raise the status of their listings by making charity donations as well. The site features a detailed description of over 60 different gambling sites, including the game rules, data such as the minimum and maximum bet and the average house rake (ie. the fee) and, of course, whether the game is provably fair.\nAltogether, the Bitcoin gambling industry represents a shining example of what rapid internet-enabled innovation, coupled with the extreme malleability of a monetary technology like Bitcoin, can do. House rakes are low, with nearly all sites below 2% and some even below 1% compared to 5-50% in traditional online and offline casinos, and the invention of mathematically provable fairness has completely substituted the expensive certification processes and specialized hardware of the machines in Las Vegas. Higher-order services like quality control are independently provided by the community, and information on fraudulent sites is able to progress through the internet at lightning speeds. Although gambling is usually considered one of the more shady industries in modern economy, in the world of Bitcoin it is rather a powerful example of business done right.", "year": 2013, "month": 8, "day": 3}

The conference team posted the following press release.\nAtlanta to Host CryptoCurrency Conference\n\u201cBitcoin and The Future of Money\u201d\nAtlanta, GA, July 24, 2013 -- Nearly four years ago, a protocol for a new Internet money posted its first exchange rate to the dollar. It was a small fraction of one penny. The date was October 5, 2009. It was the date that Bitcoin went from being a mere abstraction, posted pseudonymously on a forum, to become the combination money and payment system that is rocking the world today.\nIn these four short years, a large infrastructure of global businesses have been built up around Bitcoin. It is used for global payment processing, casual exchange of debts, donations to nonprofits, online gaming, and a form of savings and spending among young, computer-savvy students. It is playing an increasingly important role as safe haven in countries with unstable currencies.\nTo commemorate this date, and to explore the economic and political implications of this pure, market-based base monetary order, experts from academia, journalism, investing, and industry will gather October 5, 2013, in Atlanta, Georgia, to present their analyses and outlooks for the future. The venue is The Twelve in Atlantic Station.\nThe conference is \u201cBitcoin and the Future of Money\u201d run under the auspices of the CryptoCurrency Conference.\nThe opening reception on Friday night October 4, is being sponsored by the Atlanta-based Bitcoin processing startup BitPay. All attendees are invited to tour BitPay\u2019s offices and learn about the business of Bitcoin.\nThis is the first large-scale Bitcoin conference in the Southeast of the United States. The URL for details and registration is: CryptoCurrencyCon.com. The conference is being co-sponsored by the Foundation for Economic Education, Bitcoin Magazine, BitPay, and Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin.\nThe speakers include:\nTony Gallippi (CEO, BitPay)\nStephen Pair (CTO, BitPay)\nJeffrey Tucker (Laissez Faire Books)\nStephan Kinsella (Houston, TX)\nDoug French (Laissez Faire Club)\nMichael Goldstein (The Mises Circle at UT-Austin)\nPeter Surda (Vienna, Austria)\nCathy Reisenwitz (Sex and the State)\nCharles Hoskinson (Bitcoin Education Project)\nDaniel Larimer (Bitcoin Education Project)\nAdam B. Levine (Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin)\nTuur Demeester (MacroTrends)\nDaniel Krawisz (The Mises Circle at UT-Austin)\nThe panels and speeches will deal with all the critical topics in the world of cryptocurency.\nHow much will Bitcoin grow over the next four years? How far will its reach extend? What does its invention and successful use imply for the theory and practice of money and banking?\nWhat are the investment implications? What does Bitcoin do to the presumption that money must be the exclusive province of the political order? And, more fundamentally, what makes Bitcoin work at all?\nThis currency is a unique creation of the Internet and it has features completely unlike existing government monies and existing systems of credit-card processing.\nIts ledger lives on distributed servers.\nIt is exchanged peer to peer.\nThe source code is completely open.\nPayments are processed using public-key cryptography.\nAt the same time, Bitcoin itself conforms with the properties of money with academic precision, which accounts for its value. Pulling all these points together, and exploring the implications for economic growth, is the driving goal of this conference.\n\u201cWhether you are new to the Bitcoin world or a savvy code monkey who has been mining for years, this conference invites you into a compelling conversation,\u201d says the Conference website. \u201cIt is one that we must have and cannot avoid. We are fortunate to be alive to see this happening in our time, and now is the time to learn, to celebrate, and collaborate.\u201d\nFriday night\u2019s reception will be at BitPay in the Atlanta Tech Village. The venue for the Saturday event is The Twelve, a wonderful, post-industrial hotel and conference center in Atlantic Station. The contact email for the conference is cryptocurrencycon@gmail.com.

Hack. Make conference on July 31st in the Netherlands that he will be issuing a new private minting of \u201canonymous\u201d QR enabled silver medallions.\nVaughn Perling had the courage to issue The New Liberty Dollar with a strikingly similar appearance to that of the NORFED Liberty Dollar while von NotHaus was awaiting sentencing on counterfeiting and fraud charges. However, Vaughn Perling added a disclaimer to his website that the purchaser acknowledges that The New Liberty Dollar is a \u201csilver piece medallion, and not any government issued coin.\u201d Some might, for simplicity\u2019s sake, refer to Vaughn Perling\u2019s medallion as a \u201ccoin,\u201d as I have done in the title of this article; I have previously discussed the delineation of a coin and a medallion in the eCommerceBytes article \"Not Just Semantics: Amazon Coin Is Not a Coin.\u201d\nThe new QR engraved medallions enable a user of the coin to obtain real-time \u201cmanufacturer\u2019s suggested trade value\u201d which is based on the silver spot market price plus \u201cstandard premium.\u201d The price will be in Bitcoin as well as other crypto and national currencies.\nVaughn Perling is keenly aware that a number of Bitcoiners have found themselves interested in the cryptocurrency because silver and Bitcoin enthusiasts often travel in the same circles. Said another way, silver stacking is often the \u201cgateway drug\u201d for Bitcoin adoption. Perhaps Max Keiser is the most publicly spoken silver advocate for Bitcoin (for what it\u2019s worth, here is\u00a0Max Keiser\u2019s first website entry on Bitcoin\u00a0from December 2010). Because of Vaughn Perling\u2019s Silver/Bitcoin awareness and \u201ca promise he made to Satoshi Nakamoto eight years ago,\u201d live BTC conversion rates are one of many currency options linked to the QR code.\nI spoke with Vaughn Perling who explained how this medallion is different than that of the single use, disposable cold storage technologies out there today:\n\u201c\u2026These wallets are by nature one-time use. This is so possession is required for redemption, and to verify that they have not been redeemed and still hold their value. There is also a required trust in the issuer and so there are some security issues around that.\u201d\nVaughn Perling is an admirer of the the Casascius crypto-coin, the new Lealana Physical Silver Litecoins, as well as the upcoming physical Litecoins by the Litecoin Foundation (Goat, Chaang-Noi\u2019s team).\nVaughn Perling explains, \u201cas a medium of exchange, {current cold storage concepts} do not live up to the promise of good money as measured through the expanse of time and into the future.\u201d\n\u201cMetals, glue, and holographic film used in cold storage until now have physical properties which respond differently to environments. They may be hot or cold or wet or dry, and for a pocket piece suitable for carrying daily, this is not suitable.\u201d\nThis new minting is a return to durable and persistent money that can be used as a\u00a0store of value.\nI asked Vaughn Perling about the evolution of this concept and where it might be headed. Would it be possible in the future to embed an LCD in the medallion with a lithium battery compartment?\n\u201cIn order to maintain the integrity of the piece, it ought to be a uniform substance. We struggled with a lot of different ideas, and the QR was the result. We had this answer a few years back, but the market wasn\u2019t ready. Now with the Bitcoin constituency (who are all very familiar with QR codes) the market is ready. The percentage of people using QR codes for anything is still very small, but the percentage of Bitcoin people using it approaches 100%.\u201d\nThe Royal Dutch Mint\u00a0was the first to embed a QR Code into a coin back in 2011 but the new Quarter Bitcoin will be the first to track the value of the coin itself.\nThe new minting will be as anonymous as U.S. Coins issued by the U.S. mint which unlike Federal Reserve Notes, do not have serial numbers engraved on them.\nVaughn Perling further explains:\n\u201cThe embedded cryptography of cold storage cryptocurrencies until now has made each piece unique and therefore traceable, just as the serial numbers on most fiat currencies [are] traceable\u2026.I sought to make something more flexible. It should be capable of anonymity\u2026just as the change in your pocket is more anonymous than the paper money in your wallet, this is a characteristic of coinage that I sought to maintain in the pieces I would create\u2026I also sought to design a piece that would support not just Bitcoin, but any crypto-currency successor to Bitcoin.\u201d\nEach coin will be engraved \u201cone ounce silver \u2018Quarter Bitcoin\u2019\u201d in case of an\u00a0existential EMP threat\u00a0(my words not Vaughn Perling\u2019s) or perhaps something less sinister\u2026to facilitate trade in internet dead zones in remote areas.\nWhile Vaughn Perling did not want to refer to the nominal engraved value as a fiat value (latin phrase for \u201clet it be done\u201d / \u201cit shall be\u201d) he is certainly \u201ccognitare extra buxum\u201d pegging .25 BTC \u201cnominal value\u201d to the medallion. I\u2019m not completely comfortable making a comparison between cold storage and the QR coin but Vaughn Perling has brought awareness that cold storage is still in its infancy and I\u2019m looking forward to cold storage 2.0.\nLook for the coin for sale soon. I\u2019m looking forward to acquiring a piece myself.", "year": 2013, "month": 8, "day": 6}
{"title": "Freedom Hosting Taken Down, Founder Arrested, Users fed Javascript Exploits", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/freedom-hosting-taken-down-founder-arrestes-users-fed-javascript-exploits-1375664047/", "birthday": "Aug 4, 2013  8:54 PM EST", "date": "2013-08-05 01:54:00", "content": "\nFreedom Hosting, a web hosting provider specifically targeting websites in the Tor community, has been shut down, and its owner Eric Eoin Marques arrested in Ireland on charges of facilitating the distribution of online child pornography. Marques is now sitting in jail, denied bail while the Irish courts determine the validity of an extradition request by the United States. Freedom Hosting was responsible for a large number of major \u201chidden services\u201d on the Tor network, most notably including the email provider Tormail, and some estimates suggest that up to half of all major Tor hidden services relied on it for hosting. However, the site has also long been known as a hotbed of child pornography; in 2011, Operation Darknet, an anti-child-pornography subgroup of Anonymous, sent a warning to Freedom Hosting asking the service to remove all CP-hosting websites. When Freedom Hosting refused, Anonymous launched an all-out attack, hacking into Freedom Hosting\u2019s servers and shutting down all sites two and a half hours later. Now, the US and Irish governments have taken the provider down themselves \u2013 but using the much heavier weaponry of the legal system to do the job.\nWhen US and Irish law enforcement took over Freedom Hosting\u2019s servers, the sites were not simply taken down immediately. Rather, they let the sites keep operating for some time, and some extra Javascript code was injected into the sites\u2019 webpages, to be automatically run by the browsers of users accessing the sites as part of loading the page. The code in question first checks whether the user is running Firefox 17, and if they are it then opens an iframe which loads an exploit from another site, which then takes advantage of a Firefox 17 vulnerability for purposes the precise details of which are not yet known. At this point, the most common hypothesis is that the exploit makes an HTTP request bypassing the Tor protection, revealing the user\u2019s IP address to the authorities.\nThis event is a serious blow to the Tor darknet, but provides some valuable lessons to members of this fledgling underground community and, largely thanks to Bitcoin, economy. First, just like in the normal economy, centralization poses serious risks. If, rather than one hosting provider having 50% market share, the economy was split among multiple competing services, not only would each invididual shutdown be less disruptive to the Tor community, but there would also be less incentive to attack each one in the first place. With Tormail and email providers there is a parallel situation. Second, personal responsibility and control are paramount. The Tor ecosystem has no legal framework to encourage service providers to remain honest \u2013 in fact, the legal framework of the outside world often, as in this case, does the exact opposite. Thus, Tor users must work to put less trust in third parties, and keep more control in the hands of the only person they truly can trust: themselves.\nIn practice, this means two things: decentralization and encryption. Tor users should spend more time looking into decentralized alternatives like peer-to-peer file sharing, Bitmessage and Osiris, and try to avoid centralized services unless they provide genuine value that decentralized alternatives cannot replace. Ideally, a decentralized alternative would emerge to markets like Silk Road and Atlantis as well. As for encryption, PGP is the most widely-used form of public-key encryption today, allowing users to securely send encrypted messages to each other that no one can read without the private key. With the help of PGP, even centralized services like Tormail and Silk Road can be made fairly secure. With the capture of Tormail, every message ever written over Tormail is now potentially in the US government\u2019s hands. Even without the interference of any government, Tormail\u2019s operator has always had the power to do whatever they wanted with its users\u2019 messages \u2013 including selling the data, using it to blackmail users, or even modifying messages in transit to fraudulently organize meetings and business deals. Those Tormail users who use PGP, however, are completely safe.\nOne conclusion that some would draw is that Tor hidden service operators should be self-hosting their sites. However, self-hosting is a complex and nuanced issue in the world of Tor. On the one hand, just like any other centralized service hosting providers can be shut down or betray their customers. On the other hand, self-hosting hidden services locally is a very difficult task. If done wrong, depending on the site\u2019s function it potentially opens one up to detection, shutdown and even arrest, and having the job of hosting done by experts essentially eliminates this risk \u2013 even now, the operators of most of the sites compromised by Freedom Hosting\u2019s shutdown are likely still anonymous. The best solution may be a combination of having more hosting providers, having some hosting providers operating out in the open in data-friendly jurisdictions like Iceland, and more self-hosting where necessary.\nFinally, the event reminds us that Javascript injection is a serious problem, and one that Bitcoin users particularly need to be wary of. This time, the exploit potentially reveals your IP address to police. Next time, it might be a Tor-based \u201csecure\u201d online wallet provider inserting some Javascript to send all your money to 1USgoV. The DEA has already shown themselves capable of seizing bitcoins through some unspecified mechanism (likely setting up a fake seller account and fraudulently selling \u201cdrugs\u201d with it), so seizing bitcoins with a Javascript injection attack is not much of a further step. All applications relying on Javascript browser cryptography should exist in the form of Chrome and Firefox extensions and not just websites; the most popular online wallet, blockchain.info, has done this for months.\nHopefully, the Tor community will pick itself up from this attack, and services will grow to replace Freedom Hosting and Tormail (although Freedom Hosting\u2019s replacement might want to filter child porn out). The crypto-economy is not just useful for drugs; for the wider society as a whole, it is an economic playground which lacks much of the basic infrastructure that those of us in the outside world take for granted is simply absent, and users are left to figure out for themselves how markets and cooperation can thrive. Most of the experiments that take place there will certainly sputter and fail; others, however, can be the start of something great. Bitcoin itself might be an example; the Tor community and Silk Road were arguably the currency\u2019s first major committed user base in 2011 and 2012, and if it weren\u2019t for them the development of more ordinary applications for Bitcoin like international money transfer and retail might be months further behind today. Economists can analyze crypto-markets and see how communities respond to the presence and absence of fraud prevention, regulation and higher-level infrsatructure in a whole new light. TorBroker and Torwallet are both great examples of this playing out in practice. Ultimately, this takedown too will prove to be a very interesting stress test as we watch just how the community recovers in the weeks and months ahead.", "year": 2013, "month": 8, "day": 5}

EdgeCreek Property Management, which provides BYU-Idaho approved housing, is accepting Bitcoin in both the Nauvoo House for Men and the Mountain Pines Apartments for Women. This is a huge step forward for cryptocurrency, especially Bitcoin. Although someone can pay bills with Bitcoin using services like BillPayForCoins, the recent news at BYU-Idaho will bring the ease of use and practicality of accepting Bitcoin to the forefront.\n\nThere are a few other housing developments throughout the nation that accept Bitcoin or other crypto-currencies. For instance, Village on the Parkway in Orem, UT also accepts Bitcoin as payment for living costs. The Nauvoo House and Mountain Pines Apartments, however, are the first university approved housing developments to accept Bitcoin. These developments include room and all utilities for one price per semester with an option of bundling multiple semesters for a reduced cost. Every resident could obtain Bitcoin, set up a wallet, and send payment to the property manager in very little time. On the other side, the property manager sets up a wallet or merchant account with a payment processor such as BitPay, sends an invoice to the resident, and then receives payment. These methods provide both parties with a simple and secure transaction.\n\nWhat does this mean for the future?\n\nThis development is an extremely positive step for the Bitcoin community. There is excitement in a wider acceptance, but it will depend on how many residents adopt the payment method. Many young professionals (age 19-25) have adopted cryptocurrency and support continues to increase. Many of these individuals are students at universities around the world who adopt new technologies very early. Whether that is housing, electricity, or a cheeseburger from your favorite downtown burger joint, Bitcoin could help college communities by providing a secure method of payment for any good or service. Imagine paying for your books, housing, and tuition at the college of your choice without having to reach in your \u201cphysical\u201d wallet.\nThe recent news at BYU-Idaho is a huge leap forward for the Bitcoin community. By being the first university approved housing to accept Bitcoin, the Nauvoo House and Mountain Pines Apartments are forging a path for others to follow.

Bitcoin Magazine just recently learned of Poolfa.com. Poolfa serves as the first BTC/altcoin-specific Persian website. Bitcoin communities around the world are seeking to not only translate Bitcoin news and information sites into different languages but also draw coherent connections between the benefits of Bitcoin and the needs of their society.\nPoolfa is a multipurpose site with the aim of educating Iranians on the merits of BTC, dispensing Bitcoin related news, and providing a Bitcoin and Litecoin P2poolfor site visitors. From an information angle, Poolfa is developing the first Persian Bitcoin Wiki. To foster discussion among members of the Bitcoin community in Iran, the Poolfa team has also launched a Bitcoin forum similar to the Bitcoin Forum run by bitcointalk.org. Poolfa\u2019s Bitcoin forum provides tutorials on how to navigate the Bitcoin space and even Bitcoin exchange opportunities.\nAs knowledge is power, Poolfa administrators have taken steps to translate the first resources and letters on Bitcoin for Iranian citizens. Poolfa served as the first website in Iran to translate Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s first paper and release on the Bitcoin currency into Persian. Poolfa also offers The Bitcoin Beginner\u2019s Guide in Persian.\nWhile the Poolfa team continues to cover Bitcoin related news and developments for the Iranian community, this expanding organization plans to cover emerging virtual currencies in Iran. As societies around the world will begin transition to use digital currencies, Poolfa has taken steps to educate Iranians on the various currency options. Currently, Bitcoin is taking the lead, but Poolfa also exposes readers to Litecoin and other cryptocurrencies. As Bitcoin has proven to be an asset to Iranians whose rial is suffering from high inflation and an oppressive government, it will be interesting to see how successful additional alternative cryptocurrencies fare in the Islamic Republic of Iran.\nThrough serving the Iranian people as a news blog, forum, wiki page, pool for mining, exchange and translation service, Poolfa is in turn contributing to the Bitcoin community as a whole. With an expanded and empowered user base, Bitcoin will continue to grow in prominence in Iran, the Middle East, and the rest of the world.

If they\u2019re successful, we\u2019re successful.\nWith that in mind, I feel that by giving online merchants the option to accept Bitcoins as payment for goods and services will allow them to attract new shoppers looking to use Bitcoins to buy products online.\nBM: What makes your product stand out in comparison to other products/businesses utilizing Bitcoin?\n3dcart: 3dcart merchants have two options.\nMerchants can get paid in USD if they do not want to manage Bitcoins themselves, and BitPay guarantees the exchange rate and manages the currency exchange when required.\nMerchants can also opt to keep the Bitcoins they receive and manage them directly using a Bitcoin wallet.\nBy giving merchants the option, we aim to attract the masses, not just those familiar with Bitcoins/Bitcoin management.\nBM: What are your suggestions for businesses hoping to embrace the Bitcoin currency like you have?\n3dcart: Learn as much as you can about Bitcoins so you can make an informed decision on whether or not this technology is right for your business.", "year": 2013, "month": 8, "day": 8}
{"title": "Coinsetter CEO: How to Survive Regulation in the Bitcoin Space", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/coinsetter-ceo-how-to-survive-regulation-in-the-bitcoin-space-1376093743/", "birthday": "Aug 9, 2013  8:15 PM EST", "date": "2013-08-10 01:15:00", "content": "Over the past six months, we have seen federal and state regulators place increasing attention on Bitcoin and similar financial innovations. Shortly after the FinCEN guidance in March, many companies believed that they could get up and running by having a solid Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policy and being Money Services Business (MSB) compliant on the federal level alone. However, it has become clear that companies who want to survive in this space must be MSB compliant on both the federal and state levels. This has created well-publicized challenges for Bitcoin startups, who are working to legitimize Bitcoin despite the hurdles brought on by unaccommodating banks, difficult-to-obtain regulatory partnerships, and the huge costs associated with compliance.\nObtaining all of the necessary licenses to comply with MSB regulation on your own requires upwards of 18 months and millions of dollars, which is non-starter for a startup that needs to get to market quickly and on a budget. While some companies are taking this approach regardless, others in the Bitcoin space are working to form an agency partnership with an entity that is already regulated. The roadmap to compliance for any company ultimately takes good legal counsel and creativity from its founders, but there are basic steps that most Bitcoin companies (especially exchanges) should be taking to make sure they stay on the right side of the law.\nA common mistake I am seeing Bitcoin entrepreneurs make right now is pitching investors and business partners with a lack of knowledge on regulatory matters that directly affect them. It\u2019s okay to not have a background in compliance, but founders need to ramp up on it quickly if they want to survive in this scrutinized space. A few entrepreneurs are ignoring compliance altogether, believing they can build traction now and pay for the consequences later. This is a losing strategy, and companies taking this approach won\u2019t be around a year from now. States are, to many people\u2019s surprise, starting to come down strongly on noncompliant Bitcoin companies, and a single misstep can become a permanent roadblock to success in other states. Bottom line: if you\u2019re starting a Bitcoin company, you need to genuinely understand the regulation surrounding the industry and your company\u2019s business.\nWe can see how proper compliance will affect a company\u2019s survival, and there are steps we can take to move our companies towards a successful launch despite these regulatory hurdles. Through my own work at Coinsetter, I have come across general paths that make compliance feasible on a startup budget. To start, there is a lot of information available online to help entrepreneurs gain a good understanding of the basic issues. Do a Google search and read it.\nNext, it\u2019s key to find the right attorney. Ask for recommendations from other companies in the space. Work solely with attorneys that have legitimate experience in Bitcoin and who stay current on recent events. There are a few attorneys in particular that have been especially active and have a good reputation in the community. There are great options available that have reasonable pricing and care enough to create a practical game plan for you, as opposed to the inconclusive \u201cif scenarios\u201d most high-priced law firms will charge you for. MSB consultants are another asset that can steer you in the right direction, but again, make sure you get references from other companies in the space.\nOnce you\u2019ve hired the right advisors, you\u2019ll be working with them to lay out the best plan for your company\u2019s particular situation. Before you begin on these discussions, it\u2019s helpful to broadly understand the strategies other Bitcoin companies are currently pursuing. Here\u2019s a snapshot to get you started. On the federal level, one of the first steps your company will take is to create a written AML compliance policy that outlines how your company prevents and detects money laundering. A good law firm will have a standard policy template that you can use as a starting point for this. An MSB consultant can help you tailor it to your company specifically. Next, assuming you have determined that it\u2019s appropriate, your company will register federally as an MSB with FinCEN. Be sure to also understand the monitoring and reporting duties associated with this.\nMost of this information on the federal level is pretty easy to comprehend and seems manageable. However, things become considerably more difficult on the state compliance level. The more established companies in the Bitcoin space are hustling to form plans that put them on a path towards fifty-state compliance. There are a few different options that have surfaced as viable routes to take. The first option is to obtain MSB licenses state-by-state. Not only is this expensive and time consuming, but many companies will be obtaining licenses that they will eventually become exempt from as other agencies establish regulatory authority over companies in the Bitcoin space. On the plus side, companies that go this route will control their own licensing destiny. The second option is to form an agency partnership with an already licensed MSB. This option can be very expensive (prohibitively so), and finding companies that are interested in partnerships like this is surprisingly difficult. Trust plays a big role in the existing MSB business, and it\u2019s worth seeking out a consultant with pre-existing relationships to help pitch your company to potential partners. The third option is to form an agency partnership with a bank. This option is being heavily explored right now, and there do seem to be banks that are open to discussing it.\nSince every one of these fifty-state compliance routes takes time to achieve, companies should consider an initial beta launch to customers in MSB-friendly areas. This is the approach we have taken at Coinsetter. An initial launch to customers located internationally allows us to get our product into customers\u2019 hands while we negotiate a partnership that enables us to offer Coinsetter across the United States. And I\u2019ll emphasize, we\u2019re working very hard on making that happen quickly.\nIn the end, mo money mo problems. Regulation certainly isn\u2019t making starting a Bitcoin company any easier, but the huge value potential of this space will make jumping through these hurdles worthwhile. In fact, regulation around Bitcoin is still fairly mild, and it will be even more burdensome for companies entering the space a year from now. My thought is that we need to keep communication between our companies open as we push forward on this; because even if we compete on some level, all of our ships are going to sail in the same direction.\nAbout the Author\nJaron Lukasiewicz is the CEO and Founder of Coinsetter, a New York City-based company that offers a high performance levered trading platform for Bitcoin.

The price had tumbled by 40%, media attention was dwindling, and regulatory agencies were beginning to come against Bitcoin in full force. Now, however, the situation has changed. The price has recovered, to the point of even breaking a major downward trend, the graph of attention on Bitcoin has changed from a decline to a plateau, and on the regulatory front Bitcoin businesses are fighting back, both in the United States and the European Union. Businesses are continuing to develop and emerge, and the in-person Bitcoin economy, consisting of meetups and Satoshi Square events, is booming. Of course, it is far too early to say that we are free and clear; on the regulatory front, Bitcoin will be under attack for years, and merchant adoption is a challenge that will never go away. But the Bitcoin community has proven itself to be strong, and has plenty of resources and tools with which to face the challenges that the next few years will bring.\nYet Another Round of Business Adoption\nTwo off-campus housing developments officially approved by the Brigham Young University in Idaho began accepting bitcoins.Predictious, a Bitcoin-based prediction market, opened its doors this month. Predictious is far from the first site that allows Bitcoin users to bet on real-world events, but it is the first to use a market system rather than the parimutuel betting employed by its predecessors; market systems are generally considered superior because, unlike parimutuel systems, the market price precisely reflects the sites\u2019s users\u2019 opinion of the chance that a given event will take place.BIPS announced Danske Bitcoin, a service which allows those with credit cards and bank accounts based in Denmark to nearly instantly buy bitcoins with their smartphones.Khan Academy, an organization that produces freely available ten-minute online lecture videos on topics ranging from math and computer science to economics, started accepting Bitcoin donations. Bitcoin100, an organization dedicated to promoting Bitcoin adoption among charities by donating to major charities that start taking Bitcoin, promptly threw in $1000 in BTCBlueVPN, a \u201cvirtual private network\u201d service that helps users protect the privacy of their internet connections, started accepting Bitcoin.The Nikkei MJ newspaper ran a front-page article about the first restaurant in Japan to accept Bitcoin. Japan is best known in the Bitcoin world for being the home of the leading Bitcoin exchange MtGox.BitPay\u2018s Tony Gallippi announced that the company has processed a transaction volume of $7 million, 35% higher than in March. The company also announced a partnership with the popular online e-commerce platform 3dcart, allowing sixteen thousand merchants the chance to accept Bitcoin through BitPay without any technical effort beyond selecting the option and specifying their bank details.\nDon\u2019t Forget the Charities!\nThe BitGive Foundation, a nonprofit started by Connie Gallippi (sister of BitPay\u2019s Tony Gallippi) with the aim of donating to environmental and public health causes around the world, announced its launch at the Inside Bitcoins Conference.Coinforest launched a Bitcoin-based group buying website, offering its users large discounts on daily deals.The Liberal Alliance, a classical-liberal leaning party in Denmark, became the first national party worldwide with seats in parliament to accept bitcoins.Sean\u2019s Outpost, a Bitcoin-accepting homeless shelter in Florida, announced that it had produced 13,000 meals for the homeless paid for with Bitcoin donations.\nGovernment Says Ping, Bitcoin Says Pong\nThe United States\u2019 Security Exchange Commission filed charges against Trendon Shavers, the mastermind of the $5 million Bitcoin Savings and Trust ponzi scheme after nearly a year of investigation. An initial defense that the scheme was not under the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction because Bitcoin is not money failed spectacularly in court.The Bank of Cyprus and its creditors reached an agreement that will stabilize the bank\u2019s finances, at the cost of seizing 47.5% of all deposits at the bank exceeding 100,000 EUR per person. 37.5% had already been seized in April with another 22.5% provisionally frozen to pay for potential emergencies; under this deal, the additional 10% will be taken from the frozen funds and the remaining 12.5% unfrozen and returned to its owners.Freedom Hosting, a web hosting service used by nearly half of al major hidden services on the Tor network, was shut down by Irish authorities, and its owner arrested and awaiting possible extradition to the United States.Germany\u2019s largest Bitcoin exchange Bitcoin.de, announced that it has reached a deal with Fidor Bank with which Bitcoin.de users\u2019 fiat currency balances would be, optionally, converted into fully fledged FidorPay bank accounts. These bank accounts can be deposited to, withdrawn from and used to store money just like any other bank account, but at the same time will soon offer nearly instant Bitcoin trading through bitcoin.de\u2019s interface.A group of Bitcoin business owners and others in the digital currency field including Hub Culture\u2019s Stan Stalnaker announced that creation of DATA (\u201cDigital Asset Transfer Authority\u201c), a self-regulatory body for Bitcoin and digital asset-related businesses.\nBitcoin Around the World\nThe Bitcoin community in Berlin organized a successful Bitcoin meetup with dozens of people attending.The Inside Bitcoins Conference took place in New York, attracting attention from Bitcoin users from around the world, venture capitalists and many others.The Bitcoin community grew massively in Argentina, with Bitcoin downloads rising by a factor of three compared to June and the local meetup boasting over 180 attendees.CoinAva, the first Iranian website dedicated to Bitcoin, opened to the public, soon followed by Poolfa.A group of Bitcoin users in Montreal announced their plan to create the Montreal Bitcoin Embassy, a physical location that would serve as a permanent Bitcoin hub for the city.\nThe Technical Side\nLeading Bitcoin exchange MtGox announced that it has started using the Akamai computing network to host its services, allowing the exchange to serve users from thousands of servers around the world.Lead Bitcoin protocol developer Gavin Andresen proposed Bitcoin wallets with two-factor authentication, using two-of-two multisignature transactions between the user and a centralized service.Gavin also announced a payment message protocol, to be added into bitcoind starting from version 0.9. The protocol would allow online merchants to initiate payment requests that would need to be confirmed by customers, with the intent of increasing the convenience and security of online Bitcoin transactions.Sunny King released Primecoin, the first cryptocurrency whose mining algorithm is intended to perform a useful function in addition to serving as the proof-of-work to prevent 51% attacks. The function: discovering long Cunningham chains of prime numbers. Three days later, Primecoin had an exchange and gambling site accepting it and had already broken two world records for the length-9 Cunningham chains with the largest first prime.A number of alternative cryptocurrency-specific websites sprung up in the past month to cope with the spike in public interest in the currencies.\nLet\u2019s hope for more great Bitcoin news in August and September", "year": 2013, "month": 8, "day": 8}
{"title": "What Libbitcoin and SX are And Why They Matter", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/what-libbitcoin-and-sx-are-and-why-they-matter-1376064919/", "birthday": "Aug 9, 2013  12:15 PM EST", "date": "2013-08-09 17:15:00", "content": "Amir Taaki\u2019s libbitcoin has come to be one of the most advanced alternative implementations of the Bitcoin protocol in existence. Although there are now dozens of alternative implementations on the market, libbitcoin is one of the few that re-implements the complete Bitcoin standard, allowing users to run a deterministic wallet, an elliptic curve message signing interface and, of course, a fully functional Bitcoin node. Even multisignature transactions, which many popular wallets including blockchain.info and Bitcoin Wallet for Android still do not support, libbitcoin handles just fine. Libbitcoin is also unique in its modularity; the package itself is a software library, containing a set of components each of which can be programmatically called individually, avoiding the need to start up a fully fledged, monolithic software daemon just to make a few simple transactions or queries. If you want a full client running locally, you can use libbitcoin to do that, but you can also just as easily only use libbitcoin for transaction management and networking and rely on other nodes for transaction data. Whatever you need, you use, and whatever you don\u2019t need you simply don\u2019t bother with.\nAs the first major practical application of libbitcoin, Amir Taaki has recently released sx, a set of command line utilities for working with Bitcoin keys and transactions. The basic intent is simple: empower Bitcoin users who are somewhat technically skilled, but not experienced programmers, to interact with Bitcoin not just as an interface where they type in an amount and a destination address and bitcoind does everything for them, but also work directly with the underlying building blocks. Every sx tool follows the Unix philosophy: it does one thing, and it does it well. genaddr takes an Electrum wallet seed or master public key and an index and returns an address. mktx creates unsigned transactions, and sign-input signs transaction inputs. history returns a list of unspent transactions associated with a Bitcoin address that can be used as inputs \u2013 and so on.\nThese tools can be accessed on the command line to construct Bitcoin transactions one step at a time, or one can call them programatically (eg. with os.popen(command).read() in Python) to create Bitcoin software like merchant packages and wallets. Up until now, creating a new Bitcoin wallet was difficult \u2013 one would need to either re-implement everything from scratch, take an existing wallet and work hard to untangle the code to separate out the transaction logic from the wallet logic, or rely on a bitcoind node running in the background. With libbitcoin and sx, however, the tools to work with Bitcoin transactions on the lowest level are already there \u2013 freeing developers to work on the problems that truly need the most work \u2013 like optimizing security and the user experience.\nMore Than Just A Library\nSo why do libbitcoin and SX matter? As it turns out, the answer goes far beyond the simple fact that they\u2019re convenient. One of the main problems with the Bitcoin ecosystem is that although Bitcoin is nominally decentralized, in reality the miners that keep the network running are all running the same piece of core Bitcoin software: bitcoind. Bitcoind is the \u201cheadless\u201d (ie. command line only) version of the original Bitcoin client that has been developed ever since Satoshi released the first version in 2009, and serves as the software that all miners and nearly all businesses use to communicate with the Bitcoin network.\nThis is unhealthy for two reasons. First, having a monopoly can potentially lead to highly disruptive blockchain forks; for example, in March this year the removal of a database bug preventing bitcoind nodes from processing a block simultaneously affecting the status of more than 5,000 transactions caused the Bitcoin network to split in half for about six hours as nodes with the bug and without the bug disagreed on the validity of a block and started working on two separate blockchains. The fix: the Bitcoin community came together and agreed to shut down the version 0.8 nodes, and added the database bug to the official protocol for two months until it could be removed in a controlled way two months later. If there were instead five different Bitcoin implementations in active and widespread use, the failure of any one would only affect a small portion of the Bitcoin network \u2013 and ordinary users\u2019 clients, which typically only verify transactions and not blocks, would probably not be affected at all as, in the event of a fork, the \u201clegitimate\u201d blockchain would nearly always be the one commanding a majority of the network.\nThe second reason is political. Many core bitcoind developers, particularly lead developer Gavin Andresen, are also part of the Bitcoin Foundation, an organization which has taken clear steps toward using political lobbying as a strategy for protecting Bitcoin. The fear is that, in the future, the government might try to regulate Bitcoin more, and give the foundation an ultimatum: you include certain privacy-eroding features (a moderate example might be an \u201caddress validation fee\u201d to discourage people from covering their tracks by creating many Bitcoin addresses) in the protocol, or we ban Bitcoin exchanges. The Foundation may well comply, and the US government knows it. If the Foundation did not have the power to make these kinds of changes to the protocol without widespread international consent, however, then the US government would not have this option \u2013 they would be forced to either try banning Bitcoin outright, at the cost of massive goodwill among the tech and open-source community at the very least, or let it be and focus on softer regulatory strategies. This is why Bitcoin advocates like Amir Taaki, Joerg Platzer and others have long supported diversifying and internationalizing the Bitcoin ecosystem. And libbitcoin just might be the catalyst that finally sets the process going.\nHow do you use SX?\nInstalling sx is very simple if you\u2019re on Linux; on the command line, wget http://sx.dyne.org/install-sx.sh followed by sudo bash ./install-sx.sh is all it takes. If you\u2019re on Windows or Mac, things are somewhat more complicated, although not more so than any other similar software package; the source code is available for download at https://github.com/genjix/sx, and from there you can install it manually.\nOnce sx is installed, here are some of the things you can do with it. First, the basic address and key manipulations.\nGenerate a private key/public key/address triple:\nsx newkey > pk1cat pk1 | sx pubkey > pub1cat pk1 | sx addr > addr1cat pk1 pub1 addr1\n\nGenerate private key/address pairs from an Electrum wallet:\nsx newseed > seedfor x in `seq 0 9`; do cat seed | sx genpriv $x; cat seed | sx genaddr $x; done\n\nGenerate just the addresses from a master public key:\ncat seed | sx mpk > mpkfor x in `seq 0 9`; do cat mpk | sx genaddr $x; done\n\nTransactions\nNow, it\u2019s time to get into transactions. First, a little understanding is needed as to how transactions work. Bitcoin does not have the concept of \u201caccounts\u201d; instead, a transaction spending money from an address must directly reference some transactions sending at least an equal amount of money to that address; these are usually called \u201cprevious transaction outputs\u201d. For example, if you have an address to which you sent 2 BTC, 3 BTC and then 4 BTC and want to spend 5 BTC, you are not spending 5 BTC out of that address; rather, you are spending the 2 BTC and 3 BTC transaction outputs. Additionally, an output cannot be \u201cpartially spent\u201d; even if you only want to send 0.1 BTC, you must consume an entire output. You can avoid wasting 1.9 BTC by adding a special output to the transaction, called \u201cchange\u201d, where you send the remaining funds back to yourself.\nThe basic command that you will use to get these unspent transaction outputs is sx history:\nsx history `cat addr1`\n\nHowever, this by itself returns all transactions connected to that address, not just the ones we want, so we need to filter the output a bit. This is a complicated script; basically, it first looks for the word \u201cUnspent\u201d in the history and gets those lines plus the transaction data in the two lines above them. Then, it uses grep and awk to extract just the data that we need. Note that the command returns values in satoshis; 100 million satoshis equal 1 BTC. Send 0.001 BTC to the address contained in the addr1 file (cat addr1 to see it, and sx qrcode `cat addr1` qrcode.png to generate a scannable QR code), and run the following command:\nsx history `cat addr1` | grep Unspent -B 2 | grep output | awk '{print $2}' > inputcat input\n\nNow that we have the history, let\u2019s use sx to create and send a transaction.\nsx mktx txfile.tx `cat input` -o 18qk7SqRHuS4Kf3f6dmsvqqv7iw1xy77Z6:90000sx rawscript dup hash160 [ `cat addr1 | sx decode-addr` ] equalverify checksig > raw.scriptcat pk1 | sx sign-input txfile.tx 0 `cat raw.script` > sigsx rawscript [ `cat sig` ] [ `cat pub1` ] | sx set-input txfile.tx 0 > txfile2.tx; mv txfile2.tx txfile.txsx broadcast-tx txfile.tx\n\nHere\u2019s what to do if you have multiple transaction inputs you want to spend. Send 0.0002 BTC to your address five times, and run the above sx history command again and make sure that it returns five outputs. To avoid having to copy and paste five transaction inputs by hand, we\u2019ll do a little more command line magic:\nsx history `cat addr1` | grep Unspent -B 2 | grep output | awk '{print $2}' > temp1cat temp1 | sed 's/^/-i /' | tr '\\n' ' ' > temp2cat temp2\n\nNotice how temp2 contains all the inputs in exactly the right format for sx mktx. Now, we just splice them in:\nsx mktx txfile.tx `cat temp2` -o 18qk7SqRHuS4Kf3f6dmsvqqv7iw1xy77Z6:90000sx rawscript dup hash160 [ `cat addr1 | sx decode-addr` ] equalverify checksig > raw.scriptfor x in `seq 0 4`; do cat pk1 | sx sign-input txfile.tx $x `cat raw.script` > sig$x; donefor x in `seq 0 4`; do sx rawscript [ `cat sig$x` ] [ `cat pub1` ] | sx set-input txfile.tx $x > txfile2.tx; mv txfile2.tx txfile.tx; donesx broadcast-tx txfile.tx,\nThe Holy Grail: Multisignature Transactions\nFirst we\u2019ll generate 3 sets of private keys, pubkeys and addresses.\nfor x in `seq 1 3`; do sx newkey > pk$x; donefor x in `seq 1 3`; do cat pk$x | sx pubkey > pub$x; donefor x in `seq 1 3`; do cat pk$x | sx addr > addr$x; done\n\nThen, we\u2019ll create the multisig address.\nsx rawscript 2 [ `cat pub1` ] [ `cat pub2` ] [ `cat pub3` ] 3 checkmultisig > msig.scriptcat msig.script | sx showscriptcat msig.script | sx scripthash > 3addrcat 3addr\n\nSend 0.001 BTC to the address (doesn\u2019t work with all wallets!) and then run the following to get the transaction hash:\nsx history `cat 3addr` | grep Unspent -B 2 | grep output | awk '{print $2}' > inputcat input\n\nNow, we need to construct the transaction and sign it, in this case using the first and third private keys (first and second or second and third work equally well). We\u2019ll send only 50000 satoshis, leaving 0.0005 BTC as a fee.\nsx mktx txfile.tx -i `cat input` -o 18qk7SqRHuS4Kf3f6dmsvqqv7iw1xy77Z6:50000cat pk1 | sx sign-input txfile.tx 0 `cat msig.script` > sig1cat pk3 | sx sign-input txfile.tx 0 `cat msig.script` > sig3sx rawscript zero [ `cat sig1` ] [ `cat sig3` ] [ `cat msig.script` ] > input.scriptcat input.script | sx set-input txfile.tx 0\n\nAnd, finally, broadcast the transaction.\nsx broadcast-tx txfile.tx\n\nFairly complicated, but multisignature transactions are not exactly simple in any case. With sx, however, the complexity is reduced to a series of steps that you can simply follow, or even incorporate into your own programs to run whenever you need to. Whether you\u2019re a command line enthusiast, a Bitcoin developer or just someone interested in looking more deeply into how Bitcoin transactions work, sx is the tool for you. Happy hacking!", "year": 2013, "month": 8, "day": 9}

Nine entrepreneurs provided two minute pitches on their Bitcoin start-up businesses. Graham Lawlor and Tatiana Bakaeva of Ultralight hosted the event.\nThe evening was structured with nine 2 minute pitches from different Bitcoin related start ups. At the conclusion of the evening the audience selected three winners for in-kind prizes. Four panelists, including Andrew Chang (Founding Partner, Liberty City Ventures), John Frankel (Partner, ff Venture Capital), Nikhil Kalghatigi (Principal, SoftBank Capital), and Matthew Witheiler (Principal, Flybridge Capital Partners) from venture capital firms provided guidance to each start up following their presentations. Bitcoin related start-up presenters included, Divya Thakur (Developer, BTX Trader), Shawn Sloves (Co-Founder, Atlas ATS), Ayoub Naciri (Co-Founder, artaBit), Andre De Castro (Ecoincashier), Jesse Heaslip (Co-Founder, Bex.io), Aric Fedido (Founder and CTO, OpenWallet), Kingsley Edwards (LeetCoin), Shamoon Siddiqui (CEO, Crypto Street), Megan Burton (Founder and CEO, CoinX). At the conclusion of the evening, Megan Burton of CoinXwas selected as the winner and runners up included Aric Fedida of Open Wallet and Shawn Sloves of Atlas ATS.\nFirst prize went to Megan Burton who used her two minutes to discuss her new company CoinX, a digital currency exchange. CoinX serves as a virtual currency platform for the buying and selling of Bitcoin, Namecoin, Devcoin, Litecoin, Ixcoin, PPCoin, Terracoin, and additional digital currencies. CoinX specifically provides services to buy and sell digital currencies, accept payment in digital currencies and create a free Bitcoin wallet.\nThe overarching purpose of this first Ultra Light Bitcoin Startup event was to provide necessary tools and advice to early stage Bitcoin startups. With time allotted to sell their company, each start-up representative not only practiced their sales pitch but also then received guidance from the panel on how to refine their investor pitch. The four venture capitalists on the panel then provided insight on how investors evaluate startups. With the Bitcoin currency growing in prominence, Ultra Light Startups made a wise decision to carve out an evening to feature Bitcoin startups.\nUltra Light Startups events take place the second Thursday of each month in New York and Boston. Events on average have an audience of around 150 to 250 attendees. Ultralight Startups ventured into the world of Bitcoin on July 11 and were pleased with the results as well as the opportunities that will follow from this step.", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 20}
{"title": "Coinbase: Instant purchases, delayed support", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/coinbase-instant-purchases-delayed-support/", "birthday": "Jul 16, 2013  7:13 AM EST", "date": "2013-07-16 12:13:00", "content": "\n\nCoinbase is a company which offers a product which sounds too good to be true \u2013 the ability for US customers to buy bitcoins from their bank accounts via an ACH transfer with a locked-in exchange rate of 1% above spot at the time the purchase is initiated. And now they\u2019ve just announced their\u00a0most exciting feature yet: instant purchases. Granted, it takes 30 days to become fully verified to get access to the maximum transaction limit, and instant purchases, but that\u2019s a small price to pay because once you\u2019re fully verified it\u2019s smooth sailing after that, right?\n\u00a0\nUnfortunately even after completing all verification steps it\u2019s not always smooth sailing. Ever since Coinbase opened up to ACH purchases, some users reported cancelled purchases, especially in cases when the exchange rate jumped between when the sale was initiated and when it was completed.\n\u00a0\nThe typical scenario that these users describe is that the bank transfer clears according to their online banking, but approximately at the time when they promised in the initial purchase message that the bitcoins would be released, what happens instead is that the transaction gets cancelled.\u00a0\nI should note at this point that in almost every reported case, the individuals who contact support do eventually have the problem resolved to their satisfaction, and it\u2019s likely that customers who have their orders cancelled after a drop in the exchange rate are probably less likely to complain about it.\n\u00a0\nThis kind of problem was a lot more understandable back in February and March when they were just rolling out ACH buying to the public. Unfortunately, it\u2019s still going on, and it\u2019s still almost impossible to get help in a timely fashion when it does. The email itself is incredibly frustrating, because it give the user no indication of what they\u2019ve done wrong or what they can do to fix the problem other than try again \u201cin a few weeks\u201d. Coinbase has no phone support available, and email support requests can take a few business days to receive a response.\n\u00a0\nAs can be seen in several\u00a0bitcointalk.org\u00a0and\u00a0Reddit\u00a0forum threads started by frustrated customers, a lack of an explanation as to why their anti-fraud system has so many false positives leads some to question whether or not Coinbase cancels trades following large exchange rate fluctuation because \u00a0it becomes more profitable to sell the bitcoins back on the exchange instead of delivering them to their users. This is the kind of speculation that is corrosive to a company\u2019s public image, and can scare off new customers. If Coinbase had more robust and responsive support options so that users who encounter these problems can get assistance in a timely fashion, it would go a long way towards countering accusations of exchange rate shenanigans.\n\u00a0\nAt the same time, their pricing structure doesn\u2019t leave a lot of room for support staff or for losses caused \u00a0by fraudulent purchases. With only a 1% commission on each sale, their entire operation must be largely automated and they have little margin available to hire a large support team. They also don\u2019t want to give away information about their algorithm that would allow malicious users to bypass their fraud detection system.\n\u00a0\nThere is one change they might consider which would alleviate the speculation though.\u00a0Instead of immediately reversing a sale which trips the fraud filter, hold on to the bitcoins and give the customer a reasonable window in which to contact support and clear things up. This would at least allow the original purchase price to be honored and would refute accusations that the cancellations are related to changes in the exchange rate, while still prevent releasing bitcoins on a potentially fraudulent sale.\n\u00a0\nCoinbase is offering a service in the US market that is unmatched by any other company \u2013 the ability to buy bitcoins directly from a bank account at extraordinarily low prices. The only downside is that their low prices are necessarily bundled with limited support options. If they can find a way to strike a better balance between those two competing objectives it would remove a blemish from an otherwise excellent product.", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 16}
{"title": "Introducing Bitcoin: The Movie", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/introducing-bitcoin-the-movie-1374549778/", "birthday": "Jul 22, 2013  11:22 PM EST", "date": "2013-07-23 04:22:00", "content": "Roughly two months ago, the Bitcoin community was first shown a trailer for \u201cThe Rise and Rise of Bitcoin\u201c, a documentary following the travels of 35-year-old computer programmer Daniel Mross as he explores the merchants, entrepreneurs and others in the Bitcoin community all across the world. In June, a couple in Utah announced a project to live only on Bitcoin for ninety days and make a movie about their adventures, and have already raised $70,000 for their efforts. Now, a group led by producer Andrew Wong and filmmaker Marco Vitale has announced that the Bitcoin community will be seeing not one or two, but three Bitcoin documentaries in the twelve months ahead. The film\u2019s title: \u201cBitcoin: The Movie.\u201d\nThe movie is now in the early stages of production, and the project is actively seeking funding on Kickstarter; so far, the project has received $10,000 of its $100,000 goal. Wong\u2019s Kickstarter page descrives his own intent behind creating the film as follows:\nI have been an avid computer gamer since I was a kid. Growing up with video games, I know a thing or two about digital currency. Even though I went to business school, the reality is that I never connected all the dots between virtual money and the real world impact it could potentially make. Well, that gap was bridged when Bitcoin caught my attention a year ago. The recent major events in Cyprus and China have further opened my eyes and changed my perception about cryptocurrency. Fast forward to today, we are here and now. You\u2019re reading this. And you know my crew and I want to make a movie about Bitcoin.\nThe documentary\u2019s stated intent is to explore the \u201csocioeconomic impact of Bitcoin around the world\u201d, and the Kickstarter page lists five sub-headings: look into consumer and merchant behaviors around Bitcoin around the world, educate the public about Bitcoin, study Bitcoin\u2019s socioeconomic impact especially in emerging markets, understand why Bitcoin users are getting involved in Bitcoin, and help build Bitcoin\u2019s infrastructure. From viewing the trailer, the fourth goal, that of understanding why Bitcoin users are finding the currency so attractive, is perhaps the most important. The trailer tells the stories of three Bitcoin users around New York City:\nPatrick Che, the operator of XCubicle, a \u201chybrid tech shop\u201d specializing in walk-in and mail-in electronics repairsDan Lee, the owner of Oxford Kitchen, a restaurant and organic grocery storeLena Sklyut, the owner of the Old Fulton Creperie\nThe three business owners all have different reasons for supporting Bitcoin. Patrick Che is excited about Bitcoin\u2019s potential to rein in political systems. \u201cIt prevents governments from printing a lot of money, and preventing governments from abusing their power with a currency through which they can control the entire population,\u201d Che says. Lee, on the other hand, is a pragmatic merchant. \u201cIt\u2019s actually cheaper than processing credit cards, there really aren\u2019t any chargebacks on the merchant side, and you get funded pretty much the same day, usually within the same hour. So when oyu look at it that way, those are actually pretty good benefits for a merchant,\u201d he replies. And Sklyut places herself in the middle. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about Bitcoin from a friend of mine who is really into technology, and they told me that Bitcoin was the currency of the future,\u201d she tells the viewers, \u201cso I figured I want to be one of the people accepting that and supporting the future.\u201d\nNew York City is only the start of the film\u2019s objective. Ultimately, Wong would like to take his crew to travel to Bitcoin sites all around the world; the problem is, the crew needs money to do so. If the Kickstarter campaign reaches $100,000, the crew would be able to travel to four countries. At $150,000, the amount goes up to seven countries, and at $200,000 a total of ten countries would become possible. The film itself is expected to come out by July 2014, and will be submitted to the Sundance Film Festival.\nFilms like this documentary, and the Rise and Rise of Bitcoin scheduled to come out at the end of this year, are representative of a side of Bitcoin that has been rapidly growing since the beginning of 2013: the human side. While in 2010 Bitcoin was simply a project to write software for, and 2012 a currency to develop businesses and financial services around, in 2013 we are now beginning to see widespread interest in the Bitcoin community. The observation holds outside the world of film too; the couple\u2019s 90-day Bitcoin challenge is as much for themselves as it is to produce a show for the world, and in May Forbes reporter Kashmir Hill herself undertook the \u201cBitcoin diet\u201d for a week. Now, she has become one of the more prolific reporters about Bitcoin in the mainstream media community. One of the more attractive, and practical, potential uses of Bitcoin has always been as a sort of worldwide traveler\u2019s check; once the Bitcoin community sufficiently grows, Bitcoin users would be able to make their way around the world, and simply exchange their bitcoins for local currency as needed, and make friends everywhere they stop at the same time. Now, it seems like Bitcoin is not simply facilitating trips; rather, for many Bitcoin is a trip\u2019s primary purpose. Twelve months from now, this may well be the way that Bitcoin takes its next major step into the mainstream.", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 23}

Over the past two years, we have seen the emergence of Namecoin, Litecoin, Freicoin, Terracoin, Devcoin, PPCoin, Worldcoin, and over thirty other coins all vying for a chance to become the next great cryptocurrency. Most recently of all, Primecoin entered the scene, offering a cryptocurrency whose mining algorithm based on locating prime number chains has attracted over seventy thousand pageviews on the Bitcointalk forums alone. With so many currencies to choose from, it can be hard to keep track of each one. Even Bitcoin data is highly disparate, with some sites offering accurate up-to-the minute market data, other sites focusing on mining statistics and still others more focused on transaction counts. Fortunately, there are a large number of sites that can help. Over the past six months, we have seen the emergence of dozens of different aggregator sites, all sharing the same goal: to keep track of the large and rapidly growing number of cryptocurrencies that are now available, and help users make sense of it all. Some of these sites offer market statistics or network data, others are mining-focused, and still others exist to help arbitrage traders. Of all the websites that have popped up to serve these new niches, here is a collection of some of the best.\nThe Alternate Cryptocurrencies Subforum \u2013 this section of the Bitcointalk forums (which were formerly the official Bitcoin forums) is by far the largest gathering spot for alternate cryptocurrency discussion. Nearly every new currency makes its first announcement on this subforum, and many continue to use it as their main location for posting updates. One can also find giveaways, alternate cryptocurrency-accepting websites, and if any new data aggregator appears after this article is written chances are it will find its way on there.List of Altcoin Faucets \u2013 one particularly useful post on the alternate cryptocurrency subforum, providing a list of all of the sites you can go to to get your first few units of almost every alternate cryptocurrency available.Coinchoose \u2013 Coinchoose provides basic data on 30 cryptocurrencies, particularly targeted toward miners. The site shows the mining algorithm (sha256 or scrypt), difficulty, reward, price (in BTC) and network hashpower of each currency, and also provides another particularly useful statistic for miners: the profitability of mining every currency relative to Bitcoin. Hence the name of the site \u2013 if you have a miner and want to decide which coin you should choose to work on, Coinchoose is the place to go. The site also offers its data in a computer-friendly JSON format at coinchoose.com/api.php.CryptCoin Monitor \u2013 an Android application to help alternate cryptocurrency miners keep track of all of their mining pool accounts.CrypTrader \u2013 this web application allows users to link their accounts to MtGox, BTC-E, Bter and Vircurex, and then instantly buy and sell on any of the exchanges from a single page. The basic idea behind CrypTrader has been tried before, in the form of Eun-Joo Hansch Seoung\u2019s BTC Trader application, but Cryptrader is superior in a number of ways. First of all, unlike BTC Trader it is a web interface, making it much easier to use and requiring less trust on the user\u2019s part than a desktop application. It is even possible, and recommended, to provide CrypTrader with API keys to your accounts without withdrawal privileges, so even if CrypTrader (or someone who hacks CrypTrader) proves to be malicious they can only move your money from one currency to another; they have no way of simply taking it for themselves. Second, CrypTrader goes beyond just Bitcoin, supporting all of the thirteen cryptocurrencies supported at the four exchanges. Altogether, if you are an arbitrage trader looking for a convenient way of looking at the price discrepancies between the various cryptocurrency markets, CrypTrader is the place to go.Cryptsy \u2013 Cryptsy is one particular cryptocoin market, offering over thirty alternate cryptocurrencies tradable for BTC on its exchange. Coins-e is another site with a similar function.Quandl Bitcoin Markets \u2013 Quandl is now offering a page with a large number of Bitcoin-related statistics aggregated from blockchain.info and Bitcoincharts. Statistics include the number of Bitcoin transactions, the average block size, the blockchain size, and Bitcoin prices on twenty different currency/exchange pairs. All data is also offered in a computer-readable JSON format, and for every statistic Quandl also offers a highly advanced chart interface and the ability to download historical data in a number of different formats. The only thing that the site is missing (as of the time of this writing) is mining statistics such as those from bitcoinwatch.com; once it includes that, this may well become the only Bitcoin statistics site worth visiting.Cryptocoincharts \u2013 this site offers charts and the orderbook for over seventy cryptocurrencies, and for many currencies the site shows data for multiple exchanges and, in several cases, even data for exchanges converting directly between that currency and the USD or Euro. Altogether, the site contains 150 charts, making it one of the most detailed alternate cryptocurrency data aggregators out there.Ripple Charts \u2013 Ripple Charts provides dozens of charts for currency markets over the Ripple network, and is the best place to get price data for Ripple\u2019s own internal currency unit, the XRP.Cryptocoin Explorer \u2013 the altcoin equivalent to Bitcoin\u2019s Block Explorer, the site provides information on addresses, transactions and blocks for over 15 cryptocurrencies. The site also provides its data in a machine-readable format via an API, which also gives the site another practical application: one can use the site to query for the balance of a particular address, allowing merchants to start accepting any of these currencies without having to worry about running their own local node (although they will need to generate a few thousand addresses; creating a deterministic wallet that can generate addresses for any cryptocurrency is still an open problem).\nFor the cryptocurrency enthusiast, these sites are all valuable tools in a rapidly growing cryptocurrency toolbox. Multicurrency online wallets are perhaps the one application that still can be worked on; so far, every cryptocurrency has retained Bitcoin\u2019s cryptographic relationship between private keys, public keys and addresses exactly (except possibly changing a \u201cmagic byte\u201d to make addresses start with a different letter), so one should easily be able to make a deterministic wallet that works over all currently existing alternate cryptocurrencies at the same time. Complete alternate currency merchant tools are the next step; currently, Kojn offers Litecoin and Bitcoin support at the same time, but accepting a dozen cryptocurrencies is the next step. From there, well, let a thousand cryptocurrencies bloom.", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 16}

When people ask the average Bitcoin afficionado how it was that they first joined the Bitcoin community, a common story is that of a tech-savvy netizen who hears about Bitcoin at some point, discounts it because the system has some obvious fatal flaws that should send it crashing down within months, and sees it again weeks or months later after a bubble of media attention \u2013 and only then do they listen. Indeed, Bitcoin is a technology so different from anything we have seen before that it is hard to imagine anyone being fully comfortable with it at first. The purpose of this article will be to help Bitcoin advocates identify what some of these misconceptions are, and how Bitcoin advocates can help potential new users more quickly make the jump.\nPitfall 1: Bitcoin is Backed by Nothing\nThis is the most common argument against Bitcoin. The idea is this: most objects that we are used to dealing with in the physical world are things that we want because they provide some specific use value to us in and of themselves. We want apples because they are healthy and taste good, we want chairs because they are comfortable and we want computers because they help us efficiently browse pictures of cats on the internet. Even things that we get not for our own use, but to trade or sell to others, derive their value from the fact that somewhere, near or far down the chain, someone has a use for it. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is not like that. Bitcoins are nothing more than numbers in a computer network, and by themselves they have no value whatsoever. Oil is valuable because you can sell it to a company which will produce gasoline and sell it to a gas station which will sell it to a driver who will use it to get where they want faster; a bitcoin is valuable because you can sell it to someone who will sell it to someone who will sell it to someone who will sell it \u2013 the chain is unending. There is no originating place where the value is supposed to start, and the whole thing rests on an unstable social equilibrium that is liable to collapse at any time.\nBad Response: Bitcoin is Backed by the Economy\nA common response to this is: bitcoins are valuable because other people accept them as payment. The argument usually follows up by citing the subjective theory of value, which essentially states that something can only be valuable if people want it, and if people want it then ipso facto it must be valuable. The response is a clever one, but the problem is that it does absolutely nothing to address the problem of infinite circular descent that makes people so worried in the first place; rather, it simply sidesteps it with a trick of linguistic sleight-of-hand. Those making this response also tend to make the claim that, according to the subjective theory of value, intrinsic value does not exist, so the questioner\u2019s desire to see intrinsic value in things is baseless. This is also wrong, but for a slightly different reason: it conflates two different definitions of \u201cintrinsic value\u201d.\nThe first definition of intrinsic value, the one that the subjective theory of value effectively refutes, is the claim that commodities have some kind of mystical \u201cvalue\u201d embedded in them as a chemical-metaphysical property sort of like melting point and density, and we value certain things because they score highly on this property. However, there is also a second definition of intrinsic value, and one that is perfectly grounded in reality: the value that something has for the purposes of final use, and not for trade. Apples, chairs and computers are all firmly grounded in intrinsic value, and company stocks satisfy this criterion to a large extent (as owning a stock brings you dividends and eventually a payout when the company goes bankrupt). Bitcoins, however, do not, and this is a problem \u2013 while computers going down by 99% in price is a strong buying opportunity, bitcoins going down by 99% in price also makes each unit 99% less useful in trade, and there is fundamentally no floor stopping a further collapse.\nGood Response 1: Go Into the Details\nThere are two good ways to fundamentally resolve the paradox behind the seemingly circular argument tha justifies Bitcoin\u2019s value. The first strategy is to explain in detail how a currency maintains its value. The argument is this: suppose that each bitcoin is worth $100, and Bob voluntarily accepts a bitcoin from Alice in exchange for a toaster. Why does he do this? Because he knows that tomorrow she will be able to give that bitcoin to Charlie in exchange for a chair. How does she know that? Because she saw Charlie accepting them yesterday, and the day before, and the day before that, and realizes that the chance that tomorrow will be the day Charlie stops taking them is quite small. Why does Charlie accept the bitcoin the next day? Because he knows that Dave will accept it the day after that in exchange foor groceries \u2013 for exactly the same reason. And so on to Eve, Fred, George and all the way down to Zachary, who will then give Alice a bitcoin in exchange for a bicycle for the same reason as everybody else.\nAt first, this seems like a circular argument: Alice accepts bitcoins because Bob accepts bitcoins, and so on, because Zachary accepts bitcoins because Alice accepts bitcoins. However, this misses the key insight that the argument makes: the fundamental role of time. It is not that everyone accepts bitcoins because everyone accepts bitcoins today; rather, everyone accepts bitcoins because everyone accepted bitcoins yesterday. Thus, as long as bitcoins manage to be valuable once, they can remain valuable potentially forever on simply through this self-reinforcing chain. Altogether, this argument provides a compelling reason why bitcoins are valuable, and so resolves the conflict.\nGood Response 2: So Is Any Other Currency\nThe other, simpler, approach to defending Bitcoin from this accusation is to not bother defending it at all; instead, you show that other currencies are just as bad as Bitcoin is. For dollars, this is easy; they too are intrinsically valueless. Some argue that dollars have intrinsic value because the government will always accept only dollars for tax payment; however, this argument has a fatal flaw: the government forcing the use of dollars for tax payment does not constitute any kind of hard floor on their value. To see why, suppose the price of dollars went down by 99% (ie. 100x price inflation across the economy). What would happen to your income taxes? Well, your income measured in dollars would go up by a factor of 100, so you would owe a hundred times more dollars in taxes as well. That is to say, if each dollar becomes a hundred times less useful in buying goods and services, it will also become a hundred times less useful in paying off your tax liability. Government is in fact not a master of its own currency\u2019s price; in fact, it is a slave to it just like everybody else in society.\nGold is harder, as it does have some intrinsic value in electronics and jewellery, but the argument here is that its intrinsic value is so small as to be insignificant; as recently as 2001, gold was worth less than $300 per ounce. If gold\u2019s intrinsic value has any power whatsoever, the rise up to $1900 in the decade that followed would imply that industry and jewellers suddenly found six times more valuable uses for it, and now that gold is down to $1300 the electronics and jewellery companies would all be buying it up on the cheap for its intrinsic use value. However, this is not the case; in fact, some argue that without the additional value heaped on by its function as a store of value gold would be worth as little as $100 today.\nPitfall 2: Bitcoin is An Aristocracy of Geeks\nThis argument is often made by those who are interested in alternative currency as a means of securing greater geofinancial equality. The claim is that Bitcoin is really no better than the fiat currency that came before it because, while fiat currency gives great power to governments and banks with at least some elected officials regulating them, Bitcoin simply takes that power and hands it to unaccountable computer programmers living in their mothers\u2019 basements instead. A parallel argument is that Bitcoin can potentially oppress the common people through an aristocracy of the super-intelligent, as ordinary people stand no chance of understanding how the complex algorithms behind Bitcoin work. When viewed from a programmer\u2019s point of view, this argument seems silly, but from the perspective of someone who is only just beginning to hear the language of \u201cSHA256\u2033, elliptic curve cryptography and proof of work, one can see how some people could be worried.\nMedium Response: Actually Explain How It Works\nMany people think that Bitcoin is complex, but in reality compared to some of the other cryptogaphic protocols of the past few years Bitcoin is downright trivial by comparison. Here\u2019s a full explanation of why Bitcoin is secure in two paragraphs:\nThe Bitcoin network maintains a database of all transactions that have taken place, and from these transactions it is possible to calculate how much money someone has. To prevent people from making transactions spending from other people\u2019s accounts, public key cryptography is used. Public key cryptography lets you create a \u201ckey pair\u201d, consisting of a public key and a private key, that lets you create \u201cdigital signatures\u201d with your private key that anyone with the public key can verify, ensuring that the message was sent by the owner of the private key and was not tampered with. Bitcoin holders use their private keys to sign transactions spending money from their wallet, and publish their public keys so that the network can verify that these transactions are legitimate.Order of transactions is also important: if Alice sends 10 BTC to Bob and then tries to send those same 10 BTC to Charlie, you want the network to reject the second transaction; otherwise, Alice can buy a product for 10 BTC from Bob, then buy a product with those same 10 BTC from Charlie and let the network throw out the transaction to Bob, effectively defrauding Bob of 10 BTC. To solve this, Bitcoin uses a construction called a \u201cblockchain\u201d, where some users (called \u201cminers\u201d) run a computer program to pool together transactions into packages called \u201cblocks\u201d. A valid block is hard to produce \u2013 so hard, in fact, that on average the entire network only makes one every ten minutes, and difficulty is calibrated so that it stays that way. Each block also includes a pointer to the last block, creating the \u201cblockchain\u201d; if there are two competing blockchains the longest is taken to be correct. It is impossible to change the content of any block without making the block invalid; the reason is that the mathematical properties that make a block valid are so convoluted that changing even one bit in the block would require redoing nearly all of the work in creating the block to make it valid again. Redoing all of the work would also make the block considerably different, so the pointer in the next block pointing back to that block would need to be changed, so the next block would also need to be redone, and so on. Thus, if Alice wants to double spend her 10 BTC, she would need to create a new block from before she sent her 10 BTC to Bob, and then catch up with the rest of the network from there faster than the network adds new blocks itself \u2013 a task almost impossible for any single individual.\nThis is certainly quite complicated to take in all at once, and Satoshi\u2019s whitepaper explains the concepts in more detail, but surprisingly enough the explanation has very little mathematical content; understanding the properties of public key cryptography is all it takes. Most other truly novel cryptographic algorithms developed today, on the other hand, require the equivalent of a university degree just to understand the algorithm\u2019s steps. With Bitcoin, you do need to trust academic mathematicians that the underlying cryptosystems (elliptic curve cryptography for public and private keys and SHA256 to provide the highly \u201cconvoluted\u201d block validation properties) are secure, but this has been independently researched by hundreds of university departments around the world, and all agree that the underlying technologies are secure. At this step, the security of SHA256 and ECC itself, the \u201chere\u2019s how it works\u201d argument does break down slightly, which is why the next response I will present is somewhat better (although you should certainly never shy away from an opportunity to educate people about Bitcoin\u2019s inner workings or the mathemagical wonders of cryptography).\nGood Response 1: Mathematicians Are Not A Cartel\nIf one makes the comparison between the coercive power of governments and social status of banks and the mathematical and computer science expertise of any possible \u201cmasters\u201d of the Bitcoin system, the comparison breaks down at one particular place: math and comp-sci geeks are not on the same team, or indeed necessarily on any kind of team at all. Whereas the governments of the world meet up at specialized forums, the banks have industry conferences and exclusive events targeted toward the super-wealthy, and both heavily interact with each other through central banks and regulatory systems, mathematicians are pretty close to the opposite of an organized class. The wizards of numbers and Greek letters are distributed across various universities in the world, and the masters of the digital universe can be found anywhere from open-source development groups to corporations to your local teenage whiz kid. Saying that these groups are threatening to seize control of society is as absurd as claiming that blacksmiths and sword makers were on the verge of taking control of armies during the Middle Ages.\nFurthermore, the clique of mathematicians and computer programmers is an open one; while joining the political and banking system requires a high degree of existing wealth, luck and social connections, anyone can start learning math and CS simply by taking some of hundreds of free open online courses. From there, Youtube videos, digital and paper textbooks and libraries can provide further support, and if you or your parents have anything close to a middle-class income (and are outside of the United States) universities are also there to help. Good luck finding a \u201chow to become an elite banker\u201d lecture series on Coursera.\nGood Response 2: Fiat Currency is Technically Complicated Too\nThe other strategy is, once again, not to defend Bitcoin but to attack fiat currency. Among many people, there is this false conception that fiat currency is easy, because you just pass dollars around and enter numbers to make credit card payments, but Bitcoin is hard, because it involves computer programming and cryptography and SHA256. The fallacy here is obvious: there are in fact two levels of understanding, and arguably Bitcoin holds up well in both. The lower level of understanding is to simply understand the currency enough to be able to use it. Bitcoin is simple: you click \u201csend\u201d to send and copy and paste your Bitcoin address to receive. Credit cards are arguably more complicated; you need to fill in large amounts of personal information, understand how \u201cchargebacks\u201d work, pay off your balance every month and pay interest if you do not, and, for some reason, offline credit card transactions require you to sign a piece of paper (or a computer screen) with a pen. Cash requires you to do arithmetic with various denominations to calculate change.\nOn the higher level, while Bitcoin does have its mining pools and blockchain forks and client software patches, fiat currency has a large amount of complexity on its own. In Bitcoin, having 100 bitcoins means that you have 100 bitcoins. But what does it actually mean when you have $100 in your bank account? The technical answer is, there is a liability of $100 owed by the bank to you, backed by government deposit insurance up to a maximum of something like $250,000 if the bank goes bankrupt, and the bank itself partially backs its deposits by a combination of a very small quantity of cash and a specialized, bank-only form of money called \u201ccentral bank reserves\u201d. However, most of your money the bank lends out, and then the loaners probably spend that money, leading to the merchant depositing that money at a different bank, so the same underlying cash ends up being responsible for many different bank deposits at the same time, and it gets even more complicated from there \u2013 and, to be fully fair to the Bitcoin explanation given above, that\u2019s not even getting into how the credit card system, bank ATMs and SWIFT are cryptographically secured (answer: quite a lot of the time, instead of actual cryptography security is achieved through machine-learning algorithms based on linear algebra and differential calculus). All things taken together, Bitcoin and fiat currency seem to be roughly equivalent in complexity on this front.\nPitfall 3: Bitcoins Are Finite And Will Run Out\nThe problem here is this: there will only ever be a limited number of bitcoins in existence \u2013 specifically, 21 million, and eventually, the argument goes, over time people will lose their bitcoins until none are left, making the system worthless. There are serious concerns with a limited currency supply, and the accompanying price deflation, as a model for an economy, and this article will not address those; instead, I will focus on the first concern.\nOne correct response is this: if half of all bitcoins are lost, then due to supply and demand the rest of the bitcoins will become twice as valuable. Thus, everyone will on average have and transact half as many bitcoins, and so after roughly the same amount of time, the number of bitcoins still in circulation will be down to a quarter of the original total. After three halvings, it will be an eighth, then a sixteenth and so on. However, and this is key, this progression will never reach zero. The Bitcoin protocol can always be changed to add more decimal places, and that is likely what will happen in that circumstance. Another response is to state that it is highly unlikely that we will see anything close to that much loss; if loss becomes a serious problem, we will see security systems develop to help guard against that. Ultimately, if nothing else, we can start another currency with unlimited linear growth to solve the problem; this will actually lead to a roughly constant final money supply assuming a fixed loss rate (eg. at 1 million coins per year and a 1% per year loss rate, the cap will be 100 million coins). Altogether, there are simply too many ways to get around this problem for it to be worth bothering about.\nPitfall 4: Bitcoin Is a Ponzi Scheme\nMany people when first introduced to Bitcoin immediately come to this conclusion. The argument is this: Bitcoins are sold as an investment that will go up in value, but in order for them to keep rising there must constantly be more and more people participating \u2013 and once Bitcoin runs out of new people to bring in the whole system will collapse.\nThe most common rebuttal made is in fact the correct response, although it has some elements of an archetypal \u201cbad response\u201d in it. The argument is that Bitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme, as Ponzi schemes have a centralized authority, individual users are rewarded specifically for bringing in people under them, and the schemes themselves rely on misinformation and fraud \u2013 Ponzis do not advertise as Ponzis. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is decentralized, open source and individual Bitcoin holders only benefit very slightly from every new person that they recruit. The \u201cbad response\u201d side comes out when the argument focuses on the pedantic differences between Bitcoin and Ponzi schemes; to this, critics reply that centralization does not really matter and the sheer complexity of the Bitcoin scheme is a substitute for deception. As explained above, the latter claim is quite false, but even still this only reduces Bitcoin from \u201cPonzi scheme\u201d to \u201cpump-and-dump\u201d on the level of dishonesty.\nThe \u201cgood response\u201d side of the argument comes out when the response points out that, unlike both Ponzi schemes and pump-and-dumps, Bitcoin has legitimately revolutionary properties, and most Bitcoin users are into it for much more than just the money. Bitcoin allows users to transfer money instantly around the world essentially for free, semi-anonymously and without restrictions; that alone is a very compelling promise even without the decentralization aspects. It is more accurate to say that Bitcoin is a startup, and its twenty one million units are sort of like shares \u2013 although not quite, as they also have the hugely important function of being a form of money that can be transferred instantly around the world essentially for free, semi-anonymously and without restrictions. Simply being part of the Bitcoin community is another way to \u201cbuy in\u201d; even if you own zero bitcoins yourself, if the Bitcoin economy does well, existing Bitcoin businesses will do well and you will derive a benefit in some form indirectly. If the startup pitch is compelling to you, come on in; if not, then okay, we\u2019ll keep doing our best to make our decentralized little startup great without you.", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 29}

Just this week Coin Ava launched as the first Iranian Website open for Iranians to buy and sell Bitcoins. While Iranian leadership is known for tight regulations on citizens in particular for those seeking to utilize the internet and community with the rest of the world, Iranians have found a way around onerous authoritarian restrictions through the Bitcoin currency.\nLast year, Bloomberg Businessweek pushed out an article, \u201cDollar-Less Iranians Discover Virtual Currency\u201dto conclude, \u201cFor now, Iranians are using bitcoins to maintain a fragile connection to the outside world.\u201d Iranian citizens are able to use the Bitcoin currency as a gateway to purchase products around the world and through the Bitcoin currency are not confined to a devalued Rial. As the Iranian regime continues to move forward with an illicit nuclear program despite international sanctions and pleas from leaders around the world to cease uranium enrichment, Iranian citizens are put in a tough situation. In the end of the day, Iranian President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and Iranian Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, while claiming to act in the best interest of Iranians are actually compromising the financial health and well being of all Iranian citizens. Bitcoin provides a ray of hope for many Iranians in light of Iranian Authoritarian Leadership\u2019s blatant disregard of international standards.\nAs a former Foreign Policy staff member for a Member of the US Congress, I understand the hesitancy some might have to applauding the growth of Bitcoin in Iran. Whereas it is evident that the current regime in Iran has violated international law through disregarding International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) standards and frequently utilizing hate-filled rhetoric, it is also true that there is a sizable group of Iranian citizens who oppose the totalitarian actions of their government and are working to reform their country. The Iranian Bitcoin question is a touchy subject for most, but can be worked through if viewed through lenses centered on the purpose of the Bitcoin currency.Whereas Bitcoin is a digital, decentralized currency, it serves as a source of empowerment for individuals around the world to take the initiative to control personal finances and become financially independent from a centralized source of control. In some nations, the desire to be independent from a central bank is not as strong as not all nations have authoritarian leadership and high inflation rates. Yet for some nations Bitcoin provides a source of financial security and promise outside of any centralized currency to citizens. Coin Ava\u2019s launch this week has prompted dialogue once again over the many purposes of the Bitcoin currency and the intrinsic value this digital, decentralized currency holds of citizens living under the auspices of an authoritarian government. From the perspective of a former Capitol Hill staffer who ardently opposses Iranian nuclear development, hate speech, and human rights violations, I see the growth of the Bitcoin currency in Iran as a direct affront and slap in the face of the Iranian authoritarian government. Where there is a will, there is a way, and Iranian citizens have worked to combat Iranian leadership\u2019s poor decision making with the Bitcoin currency.\n", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 18}
{"title": "Bitcoin Foundation Continues Legal Offensive With Request for Clarification on Liberty Reserve", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-foundation-continues-legal-offensive-with-request-for-clarification-on-liberty-reserve-1374376226/", "birthday": "Jul 20, 2013  11:10 PM EST", "date": "2013-07-21 04:10:00", "content": "The Bitcoin Foundation took a decisive turn in its strategy for defending Bitcoin three weeks ago when the organization wrote its reply to a cease and desist order from California\u2019s Department of Financial Institutions. Rather than meekly asking the government how the nonprofit advocacy group was acting as a money transmitter, the organization delivered a seven-page reply in which it laid out an argument that not only was the organization itself not doing selling bitcoins in any way, but in fact even if the organization was selling bitcoins the act does not constitute money transmission under present California law. After making this argument, the Foundation went so far as to specifically \u201crequest that your office issue an opinion that, for the reasons explained above, the sale of a bitcoin is not regulated under the California Money Transmitter Act.\u201d Now, Foundation legal counsel Patrick Murck has made his second move.\nTwo months ago, Liberty Reserve, an alternative payment processor known for its very weak know-your-customer policies, was shut down and its owners arrested by the United States government. In a press conference following the shutdown, FinCEN attorney Prret Bharara focused heavily on \u201canonymity\u201d as a major reason behind Liberty Reserve\u2019s shutdown, and weeks later a FinCEN Notice of Finding criticized the entire category of irreversible digital payment systems. \u201cThe fact that transactions are irrevocable, meaning that they cannot be reversed or refunded in the event of fraud, makes it a highly desirable system for criminal use and a highly problematic one for any legitimate payment functions. Revocability protects users and merchants from fraud and is a common feature of legitimate payment systems,\u201d the report claimed. Many have taken these words as a sign that, since the currency has a considerably degree of anonymity and is almost completely irreversible, Bitcoin is next. FinCEN director Jennifer Shasky Calvery came out to reassure Bitcoin users and investors, saying that legitimate businesses that follow the relevant laws \u201chave nothing to fear from Treasury\u201d, but even still many in the digital payments space seek a stronger reassurance.\nIt is under this background that Murck has sent another request for clarification, this time to US federal regulator FinCEN itself. The subject of the letter is a notice of proposed rulemaking announcing a set of steps that FinCEN intends to take in order to shut down Liberty Reserve transactions around the world. The actions are targeted around Liberty Reserve itself; the first action listed is that \u201cSection 1010.660(b)(1) of the proposed rule imposing the special measure would prohibit covered financial institutions from establishing, maintaining, administering, or managing in the United States any correspondent account for or on behalf of a foreign bank if such correspondent account is being used to process transactions involving Liberty Reserve, including any of its branches, offices or subsidiaries.\u201d However, especially in the context of the Notice of Finding, the Bitcoin Foundattion is concerned that \u201calthough the special measures contemplated by the Proposed Rule are explicitly targeted at Liberty Reserve, many of the statements in the Proposed Rule and Finding could be misread to apply more broadly to transactions involving virtual currencies generally.\u201d\nThe core arguments that the letter makes are the following:\nMaintaining consistent definitions is important. Quoting the letter: \u201cFor example, the Finding describes Liberty Reserve as a \u201cweb-based money transfer system, or \u2018virtual currency.'\u201d In doing so, FinCEN infuses virtualcurrency with a new definition \u2013 namely, a web-based money transfer system. This definition of virtual currency is inconsistent with the definition FinCEN issued in its March 18, 2013Guidance \u2026 By equating virtual currency with \u201cweb-based money transfer system\u201d in the Finding and the Proposed Rule, FinCEN risks muddying the analysis required byits own Guidance.\u201d The letter instead recommends that FinCEN use its own language from its own March 18 guidance, perhaps calling Liberty Reserve the administrator of a centralized virtual currency system.Anonymity is not necessarily criminal. Once again from the letter: \u201cThe Finding and Proposed Rule broadly state that \u2018Liberty Reserve\u2019s system is structured so as to facilitate money laundering and other criminal activity,\u2019 and cite, among other things, theanonymity of the system as evidence of that illicit structure. The Bitcoin Foundation is concerned about the broad use of the term \u2018anonymous\u2019 and about FinCEN\u2019s generalcharacterization that all \u2018anonymity\u2019 is designed to facilitate money laundering and other criminal activity.\u201d Here, the foundation is taking a brave turn, not taking the usual strategy of defending Bitcoin by claiming that it is not anonymous, but rather arguing that even anonymity itself is not necessarily criminal. This is a highly beneficial strategy for Bitcoin advocacy going forward; if Bitcoin becomes more anonymous in practice through developments like Zerocoin or decentralized mixers, the defense that \u201cBitcoin isn\u2019t that bad\u201d may not cut it anymore. Questioning what is bad in the first place, on the other hand, stands a solid chance no matter what the changes in technology.Neither is irreversibility. Contrary to what the Notice of Finding implied, irreversibility is a valuable feature for a payment system to have and, as Jon Matonis argues, it is in fact necessary for a number of applications. Matonis (not quoted in the letter) writes: \u201cAs an industry that suffered a high degree of customer disputes, online gambling is instructive because when certain customers lost in the casino and \u2018changed their mind,\u2019 it became necessary for these merchants to accept only payment methods with finality.\u201d\nThe letter concludes: \u201cThe Bitcoin Foundation supports a strong and vibrant financial system in the United States and isnot objecting to the imposition of special measures in this particular case. At the same time, the Bitcoin Foundation urges FinCEN to be precise when it describes the growing virtual currency industry, and when issuing findings and making rules affecting the industry, to avoid any inadvertent implication that all virtual currency related businesses (including compliant ones) are somehow more predisposed to facilitate money laundering than other money services businesses.\u201d All in all, this is an example of the solid Bitcoin advocacy that the foundation was created for. Rather than simply acting as a sitting duck waiting for it and its member businesses to be sued, the foundation is actively, and at the same time respectfully, seeking to engage in dialogue with federal regulators and actually turn digital currency regulation in a more favorable direction. It is only recently that Jon Matonis was named the new executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation; perhaps under his influence we will see more steps like this in the months to come.", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 21}
{"title": "How Bitcoin Can Actually Help Iranians and Argentinians", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/how-bitcoin-can-actually-help-iranians-and-argentinians-1374585681/", "birthday": "Jul 23, 2013  9:21 AM EST", "date": "2013-07-23 14:21:00", "content": "Every few months the Bitcoin media sees it fit to repeat a similar meme: somewhere, in some distant third world land, are some millions of citizens oppressed by rapid inflation or outright theft from a corrupt government, and Bitcoin, being a superior unit of value whose value goes up, not down, can, or in the more optimistic cases already is, swooping in and saving the day. In March, Cyprus was supposed to have a fully-fledged Bitcoin ATM allowing Cypriots to trade their euros for the internet\u2019s new global currency. In June, it was Argentina, where the government is instituting strict capital controls and the value of the peso has shrunk by over 30% in the past six months. And, most recently of all, we had Iran \u2013 a country whose citizens were supposed to have all already flocked to Bitcoin in 2012. The problem is this: the story that Bitcoin can protect the assets of the downtrodden is nice to tell when the bitcoin is going up in value, and indeed in March those Cypriots who had bought even a small quantity of BTC in the preceding year saw enough profits in the aftermath of the \u201cbail-in\u201d to make up for double or triple what was taken from their bank accounts. Now, however, for the past two months Bitcoin has been on a largely downward trend, and especially in the aftermath of the sudden 80% crash in April claims that Bitcoin alone can somehow protect these people from the evils of the Argentinian regime or the wrath of the European Central Bank seem silly, if not outright dishonest.\nHowever, detractors of such claims are equally wrong in their pronouncements. Bitcoin certainly can help people anywhere around the world, from Iran to Argentina and even China and Africa, protect their hard-earned wealth, and earn more wealth to lift themselves and their families out of poverty, and its potential effect in this regard may be almost as significant as that of the internet itself. However, third world residents will not be saving by purchasing units of BTC. Bitcoin\u2019s main advantage in constraining third-world regimes is not in the \u201chard-money\u201d nature of the currency with its 21-million unit limit \u2013 if nothing else, governments can circumvent this simply by hiring mathematicians to create new, and technically superior, cryptocurrencies with more currency units or even infinite supply schedules; rather, Bitcoin\u2019s advantage is, like the internet itself, in its unstoppable internationality.\nConsider the deliberately generic story of Jose, an Argentinian interested in saving up funds so that his daughter can go to university in Europe or the United States. Jose might have an annual income of $10,000 USD (equal to the country\u2019s GDP per capita), expenses of $6,000 USD, and so have $4,000 per year to save. What options do you, as Jose, have to save the money? First of all, you can keep it as cash, and see half your money disappear roughly every eight months. Another option might be the stock market, but that has been highly unstable over the past four years, and the Argentinian government may well simply decide that it wants a piece of Jose\u2019s money. Investing in foreign stock markets instead is essentially impossible due to capital controls. Finally, there is the option of buying US dollars on the black market \u2013 but, as the term \u201cblack market\u201d so obviously implies, that is highly inconvenient and risky, and the physical US dollars themselves are vulnerable to theft.\nEnter Bitcoin. Suppose Jose wants to take the third option, and secretly move his wealth into US dollars. With Bitcoin, Jose can purchase bitcoins, perhaps through some kind of Satoshi Square meetup or with a private dealer, and immediately create an account on a Bitcoin exchange like Bitstamp. BitStamp so far has seen no signs of trouble with the law, so Jose\u2019s dollars with them may well be safer than they are under his mattress. If Jose distrusts the US Federal Reserve and the ECB as well, he can open a Ripple account and store his money with BitStamp as Swiss francs. Also, Jose\u2019s investment options increase, allowing him to reduce the volatility risk from stock markets by diversifying. By going on BitFunder, he can now invest in Bitcoin mining companies, a Bitcoin T-shift site and even personal loans to a few reputable community members at 0.05% daily interest (denominated in Bitcoin; the resulting volatility can be countered by shorting on Bitfinex). If TorBroker\u2018s operators manage to find a jurisdiction in which their service is safely legal and they reveal their identities to gain public trust, Jose would also have access to a way to invest in the US stock markets as well. For the average person in first world countries, most of these investments have too much counterparty risk (a technical term for the risk that the people accepting the investment will decline to pay back or disappear) to be worth it; for Jose in Argentina, they are a somewhat more attractive proposition.\nAlso, Jose has another option with BTC that Argentinian capital controls may prevent him from doing any other way: sell his services to clients around the world. If Jose is selling physical products, this may be difficult, but if he is a writer, artist, musician or programmer, he has access to a worldwide clientele whose ability to pay for his services is not constrained by his own oppressive government beating down on them as well. Even if Jose only speaks Spanish, the South American world is much larger than Argentina; and if he speaks English, then he may be able to start earning a much higher salary, and if he finds a long-distance job he eventually even have a path to immigration to more developed countries as an \u201cintra-company transferree\u201d.\nCertainly, the bitcoin as a unit of value is useful as part of a diversified \u201cblack swan\u201d portfolio, as its value may increase massively if a major part of the mainstream economy unexpectedly (or, to some, very much expectedly) goes down. However, for those simply seeking to keep what they have, the bitcoin itself is currently a very poor option \u2013 even more so than many fiat currencies. Fortuantely, the bitcoin also has another value: as a gateway to other fiat currencies, bypassing any capital control regime that does not involve shutting down the internet outright. In Iran, the story is similar; inflation is a very serious problem, and international diversification is the cure, but Bitcoin\u2019s value is, similarly, in its ability to be used to evade capital controls and invest in more stable assets and currencies abroad. In China, and Africa, the main problem is different: very many people have no access to a formal banking system, so the advantage that Bitcoin provides is not just evading the restrictions of local governments, but also simply giving people access to any way of owning stable assets or investing at all. Many people in such countries only have access to a feature phone, not a computer or smartphone, but if Bitcoin gets any popularity in these regions for these purposes feature phone interfaces for Ripple and BitFunder will quickly be created as well. As long as there is even one country in the world where people are reasonably free, Bitcoin businesses can based themselves there, and everyone in the world can be, at least financially, free \u2013 just what \u201cthe internet of money\u201d is supposed to do.", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 23}

Mentor is currently a university student in the Netherlands, but has taken to internet privacy and the Bitcoin currency. BlueVPN provides individuals with an ability to utilize currently blocked websites, have protection against hackers, and in essence use the VPN servicing to be anonymous online. BlueVPN is now one of several VPN services accepting the Bitcoin currency for payment. Bitcoin Magazine had the opportunity to interview Mentor Pelokaj and learn more about how he got involved with the Bitcoin currency and what makes BlueVPN stand out.\nBitcoin Magazine: When did you first hear about Bitcoin?\nMentor Palokaj: Somewhere between one and two years ago I was reading an article on the future of bitcoin. Having no idea what it was I dismissed it after reading halfway. For a while nothing happened, since I was not actively on the lookout. Then half a year or so ago a programming friend of mine enthusiastically showed me the bitcoin he just bought (or rather the wallet on his phone). That sparked a round of research. Two days and many websites later bitcoin seemed like the future of currency. I tried to get my hands on ASIC devices for mining, but they were all either conceptual or to be shipped way later. Right now I have 20 avalon chips coming my way to play around with.\nBM: What was it about Bitcoin that you found interesting?\nMP: The decentralized and inherent scarce nature. In plain English it is more like gold than money. There is no bank or government creating more as they need, it is a resource. The only difference is that bitcoin has no application (so far) outside of value storage. Gold can be put in jewelry; bitcoin is harder to apply elsewhere. One concept that created security for me is that every coin is the sum of a lot of effort. It is not just a string of numbers, it holds in it the effort, research and risk the network and miners took.\nBM: When did you first get the idea for BlueVPN and what inspired you to create the site?\nMP: Three years ago I visited China to be trained in Kung Fu. The experience was amazing and our team ended up on stage with Jackie Chan. One of the annoyances though was not being able to get onto Facebook and other services. After some Googling it turned out that a VPN can create a secure connection (I use the analogy \u2018false identity\u2019) allowing you to browse the web as if you are in a different country. The problem was that all free ones were slow, incompatible with most devices and just generally terrible. Again for a while nothing happened, but as I rolled more and more into the web space setting up a service like this became relatively easy. Looking at the current VPN market there is no provider truly trying to exist for its customers. The idea of BlueVPN is to help out people who, like me a few years ago, need something that just works. As a group of my friends is spending some months abroad, they needed some way to connect to the web securely and without blockages. That sparked the creation of BlueVPN.\nBM: Were there any pre-existing businesses that inspired you to create BlueVPN?\nMP: As mentioned there are plenty of businesses like BlueVPN, and they inspired it purely by showing what NOT to do. Ever since starting the service there have been emails coming in purely with a \u201cthank you\u201d in them. That shows exactly what BlueVPN aims to be.\nBM: Where do you see BlueVPN going in a year?\nMP: Right now BlueVPN is as good as the other providers out there. Within a year I want it to be bigger and better in so many ways. One of them is to create 1-click setup packages for every device. I dream of the day when each customer has their own private server the VPN runs off of.\nBM: What makes BlueVPN stand out in comparison to other businesses utilizing Bitcoin?\nMP: A core idea behind the service is privacy. Most companies out there use bitcoin as just another payment gateway. It is a totally legitimate use of course, but BlueVPN is even more compatible with the nature of bitcoin. Of course bitcoin is not anonymous, but is is far more secure than, for example, credit cards. This is especially true in regions where the government is spying on its people.\nBM: What are your suggestions for individuals hoping to start a business like yours?\nMP: Just do it. You have far more to lose by doing nothing than you ever will by taking action. As a shoutout I hereby offer my help to anyone wanting to start an online or even offline business.\nBM: Where do you see the Bitcoin currency going in a year?\nMP: Over the past week I\u2019ve had a lot of conversations on this particular topic. When looking at the bitcoin valuation graph is appears to follow the technology development cycle (see image). This would predict a fall, after which the productive use of bitcoin would become mainstream. Combined with Moore\u2019s law though the later phases of the cycle might be accelerated. In plain English something would appear to crash bitcoin (government interference, scandal of sorts, etc. etc.) after which it would gradually make it to mainstream. The downside of this theory is that it only works in retrospect and doesn\u2019t predict the future. Personally I believe the currency will develop into a useful addition to the global economy.\nUpdate: Mentor has since sold BlueVPN and is working on Hoasted webhosting, a company geared towards web designers.", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 24}
{"title": "SEC Files Charges Against Bitcoin Ponzi Mastermind Trendon Shavers", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/sec-files-charges-against-bitcoin-ponzi-mastermind-trendon-shavers-1374698104/", "birthday": "Jul 24, 2013  4:35 PM EST", "date": "2013-07-24 21:35:00", "content": "Victims of the largest scam in Bitcoin\u2019s brief history can find solace today as the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged fraud charges against Trendon T. Shavers of McKinney, TX for operating BTCST (Bitcoin Savings and Trust), a Ponzi scheme advertised as a financial security involving over 700,000 BTC of investors\u2019 money.\nUsing the moniker pirateat40 and boasting the associative image of a peg-legged, eye-patched buccaneer in his personal profile, Shavers marketed his pyramid scheme over a nine-month period to over 100,000 Bitcoin users registered on a popular online forum while promising compounded returns at a rate of up to 7% per week. While most investors assumed that their funds were being used for arbitrage trading and other legitimate business as Shavers was claiming they were, it is purported that Shavers cycled the money, passing bitcoins from new to old investors to give the illusion of legitimate returns. The SEC also alleges that Shavers successfully withdrew over $147,000 to a variety of privately-owned accounts to help pay for his personal and gambling expenses. The SEC is pursuing a court order to seize Shavers\u2019 assets and claim additional relief.\nWhile it is uncertain when, or if, investors will ever recoup their losses, the charges against Shavers may give U.S-based Bitcoin users something to smile about. While Bitcoin transactions have been frequently mischaracterized by various media sources as anonymous and potentially dangerous in consequence, the SEC\u2019s charges and concrete knowledge of Shavers\u2019 activities indicate the ability to analyze and track the movement of \u2018tainted\u2019 bitcoins through Bitcoin\u2019s global ledger, the Blockchain. This indication is important as it provides evidence for a counterargument to speculation that Bitcoin both enables and catalyzes criminal activity including money laundering and the sale of illegal goods and services due to an assumed impossibility of nabbing the crooks.\nHow strong this evidence is has yet to be seen. While Bitcoin transactions are capable of being traced, the identities of the sender and receiver can only be linked to a specific transaction if there is public knowledge of account ownership outside of the Blockchain. Unless a person goes to significant lengths to mask his identity, there will always be at least one other person (i.e. the person[s] with whom he exchanges) that knows he controls a given bitcoin address.\nShavers never kept his identity a secret. Information ranging from current and former places of residency to his personal Facebook profile was exposed by the same online community he advertised to as concerns over the legitimacy of his operation spread. In July 2012, Shavers even extended an invitation to investors for a Las Vegas meetup, claiming that it was an opportunity to \u201clook at a pirate, eye to eye if you dare.\u201d Soon after, a photo of Shavers sitting around a dinner table with nearly a dozen other attendees surfaced on the Internet, his appearance consistent with other photos of himself found on a variety of social media websites.\nIn short, Shavers made it too easy to be caught. But for investors hoping to see even a fraction of their losses returned, the charges against Shavers may do little to ease their concerns. While having knowledge of bitcoin accounts specifically managed by Shavers throughout his operation can allow investigators to follow his trail of fraudulent activity, it is a much more difficult task to tally and prove the sum of bitcoins lost by each investor. Analyzing the Blockchain can be extremely time consuming, and though it is unknown how thorough the SEC has been during its investigation, it is extremely unlikely that the agency operates with enough resources to trace each bitcoin linked to the crime back to its original owner. And for Bitcoin users in other parts of the world where there has been a lack of legal clarification and/or regulation, the likelihood of recovering stolen or extorted bitcoins is slim without a committed investigative agency assigned to the task.\nNonetheless, while investigators may not be able to prove the identities of all BTCST investors or the exact sum of funds lost by each, more than enough information should be available to prove Shavers\u2019 involvement in shady business practices. The SEC\u2019s charges constitute proof to dispel any myths about Bitcoin\u2019s anonymity. Bitcoin isn\u2019t anonymous, it\u2019s pseudonymous, and Bitcoin users can now point to a real world example to highlight this important distinction.\n", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 24}

In most cases, the common distribution packaging policy has many advantages.\nHowever, Bitcoin nodes are an unusual category of software: they implement a complex group consensus in which every client verifies the behaviour of every other exactly. Even an exceptionally subtle change \u2013 including apparently harmless bugfixes \u2013 can cause a failure to reach consensus. A consensus failure of one client is a security risk to the user of that client. A significant number of nodes failing to reach consensus \u2013 as happened in March 2013 due to a change in database libraries1\u2013 is a critical problem that threatens the functionality and security of the system for all users.\nFor this reason, it is vital that as much of the network as possible uses unmodified implementations that have been carefully audited and tested, including dependencies. For instance, if the included copy of LevelDB in bitcoind is replaced by a system-wide shared library, any change to that shared library requires auditing and testing, a requirement generally not met by standard distributor packaging practices.\nBecause distributed global consensus is a new area of computer science research, the undersigned request that distributors refrain from packaging Bitcoin node software (including bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt) and direct users to the upstream-provided binaries instead until they understand the unique testing procedures and other requirements to achieve consensus. Beyond being globally consistent, upstream binaries are produced using a reproducible build system2, ensuring that they can be audited for backdoors.\nSigned,\nGavin AndresenJeff GarzikGregory MaxwellLuke DashjrPeter ToddMark Friedenbach\nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0050http://gitian.org/", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 23}

In the latest case of banking aversion to bitcoin, Amagi Metals stated that the basis for the account closure is the fact that Amagi Metals accepts bitcoin as a payment method, which Bank of the West views as a risk.\nIn their statement, Amagi Metals noted that after having had an account with BotW since 2011, they began receiving inquiries about their business last month, with the bank indicating that Amagi was a money transmitter. While the bank\u2019s account closure notice does not apparently claim that the precious metals seller is in the business of money transmission, it indicates a line of thinking that fundamentally questions the legitimacy of any business that handles bitcoin. The news that that a bank has shut down a customer\u2019s account based on the particulars of what payment method that business accepts has instigated a backlash against Bank of the West by the bitcoin community. This has inspired some bitcoin users to launch a hastily designed free-for-all blacklist of banks based on reports of hostility towards bitcoin related account holders.\nWhile it is the prerogative of a bank to choose not to do business any entity based on a risk assessment, a decision to cut off a customer based on the fact that they accept a specific method of payment is unusual. When banks do arbitrarily close accounts, they often leave their disenfranchised customers with little recourse. This is poignantly evident in the case of Huntington Bank, which prompted a lawsuit from the Arab-American Civil Rights League after it allegedly shut down the accounts of hundreds of businesses and individuals with roots in the Middle East. In contrast with the Amagi Metals case, many of Huntington Banks customers were not informed of any reason behind the closures, only that they were now without a bank.\nAs an eCommerce business, Amagi provides its customers with a variety of payment methods. On the list are bank wires, personal checks, money orders, cashiers checks, PayPal, credit cards, and bitcoin. The last option was added in December of 2012, and three months later, the business announced on their blog that they had received the US Dollar equivalent of nearly $50,000 of sales denominated in bitcoin. While it remains to be seen exactly what it is about servicing a bitcoin-friendly business that keeps the decision-makers at Bank of the West awake at night, it is clear that this is not the first nor the last of this type of action.\nIn contrast with cases such as BitFloor in the United States, CaVirtex in Canada, among others around the world, Amagi Metals is not a bitcoin exchange. And in what is perhaps little consolation, its bank gave it notice before a final shutdown. In their announcement, Amagi turned to its customers to find a bitcoin (and precious metals) friendly bank. While some limited options were proffered, the challenge of finding a bank that is both knowledgeable and accepting of bitcoin is likely to remain a crucial challenge for businesses looking for their niche in the bitcoin economy.\nBitcoin Magazine\u2019s readers are encouraged to share their thoughts in the comments section.\n", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 23}

When the history of Bitcoin is written, he will be remembered as one of the brave few explorers ready to set out into the unknown and risk life and fortune to create a new world.\nBitcoin Magazine: You discovered Bitcoin in May 2011... how? where?\nErik Voorhees: It was fairly innocuous, but had profound consequences! I was cruising Facebook and saw a friend\u2019s post that mentioned some weird currency that had appreciated by a gazillion percent since the prior October. I clicked the link, read about this thing called Bitcoin, and dismissed it outright as preposterous. Fake internet money didn\u2019t appeal to me. Then I read more, and more, and I found an elegant answer to each skeptical question that popped into my mind. After a couple hours, I was utterly hooked, and realized it would change the world and I better figure out what the hell it\u2019s all about.\nThat day was one of the most important days of my life. It was like discovering some great truth, like seeing the future. I quit everything I was doing and jumped down the rabbit hole.\nBM: What is the most important feature of Bitcoin in your opinion?\nEV: This is a very good question. The most important feature is the fact that Bitcoin is decentralized, that it does not have any person or group of people who control it. It is from this feature that all the societal ramifications can occur, because a monetary system without a company or group of people behind it cannot be shut off. There is no office to raid, no server farm to close. Bitcoin is thus politically neutral. It excludes nobody, it has no geographical restrictions, it doesn\u2019t make judgments on its usage. It has no terms of service. Bitcoin is a pure technological tool which will necessarily revolutionize society and finally separate money and state. The decentralized nature is what enables all this magic.\nBM: Many people have problems trusting a decentralised system founded by an anonymous programmer\u2026 can you explain the significance of Bitcoin being an open source project?\nEV: \u00a0Yeah that\u2019s easy\u2026 open source means you don\u2019t need to trust anyone. Just go read the code. Thus the creator of Bitcoin is irrelevant, there is no need to care what his intentions were or what kind of person he was. There is no need to fear some secret scam is occurring.\nYou mention that some people have problems trusting a decentralized system, but why? Because there is nobody in charge? Because there is no person who dictates the rules? This is precisely why you CAN trust it. It\u2019s often quoted that a nation should be based on laws and not on men, because men can be corrupted, are fallible, and are often unpredictable. Bitcoin is this principle applied to money: it is a money of laws \u2013 mathematical laws \u2013 and not of men. This is why it has earned, rightly, the trust of some many enthusiasts.\nBM:\nEV: Bitcoin is absolutely the Wild West of finance, and thank goodness. It represents a whole legion of adventurers and entrepreneurs, of risk takers, inventors, and problem solvers. \u00a0It is the frontier. Huge amounts of wealth will be created and destroyed as this new landscape is mapped out. I believe the effects of this adventure will be profound, for while the \u201cWild West\u201d was a uniquely American phenomenon, Bitcoin is a global one.\nWill a mainstream Bitcoin be boring? Perhaps by definition it will be, just as electricity is boring to us today, while at the turn of the last century it was hugely exciting. And of course, just as electricity, which is now boring, enabled the creation of unlimited new, exciting projects (including Bitcoin!), so too will Bitcoin enable a world of new innovation for many years to come.\nBM: What first gave you the idea to create SatoshiDice? How would you describe your experience running the site this past year?\nEV: \u00a0I didn\u2019t create SatoshiDice, but I am involved with it. To be honest, my experience has not been as pleasant as it should have been, for being an American citizen is a huge liability, and I worry constantly that the US Government will harm me in some way.\nThe past year has shown me that America is not the land of free markets and free people that it was advertised to be in Government schools when I was growing up. America\u2019s government has grown into an abhorrent apparatus that steals, harms, and imprisons people who have harmed nobody. At best, it seizes half the wealth you earn or makes you dependent on the wealth it has seized from others, and at worst, it ruins or ends your life.\nThe amount I\u2019ve spent on lawyers just trying to navigate the absurd legal system is enough to feed hundreds of families in a third world country on a continual basis.\nIn short, my experience as an entrepreneur in \u201cthe land of the free and home of the brave,\u201d both regarding SatoshiDice and in my other projects, has taught me that America is a lie. It has become a pathetic fiefdom, and I wish Americans would wake the hell up and see what\u2019s happening.\nBM:\nSatoshiDice\nEV: Yes there is a number of people who hate me and hate SatoshiDice because it has caused so many transactions on the network. They call it spam because they believe their transactions are more legitimate than mine, and thus mine are spam. Apparently it\u2019s okay to send \u201csome\u201d Bitcoin transactions, but if you send \u201ctoo many\u201d then that\u2019s a no-no. \u201cToo many\u201d has never been defined, of course.\nFurther, SatoshiDice pays the standard Bitcoin fee for every single transaction, and in this way has paid more to support the mining network than everyone else, combined. Critics retort that there are other externalities caused by SatoshiDice. Well that is true, and Bitcoin better fix that problem, and it will. I\u2019ve offered non-trivial sums of money to people to work on and figure out good solutions, but this stuff takes time.\nIn the end, haters gonna hate.\nBM: You hold Bitcoins, but also gold and silver. Is it fair to call Bitcoin a gold standard for the Internet?\nEV: I do love gold and silver as money, because I know why they make excellent money (tl;dr it\u2019s because of their specific properties). Bitcoin\u2019s specific properties similarly make it an amazing money. And while Bitcoin is certainly new and hasn\u2019t withstood the test of time (like gold), some of its properties are far superior to metals in terms of monetary usage. Primarily, one cannot send gold instantly anywhere, period. This makes it very poor for modern commerce. While it\u2019s true that a digital gold-backed currency could exist, the fact is that introduces severe counter-party risk on the part of the backer. E-gold is the perfect example of this, because as soon as the government gets angry about how e-gold is used, it shuts it off and arrests the owners (land of the free).\nSo while precious metals make excellent money, they do have some problems. Bitcoin has problems also, of course. Neither are perfect, but in general gold and Bitcoin highly complement each others\u2019 weaknesses. Anyone who believes in free and open markets and individual rights should have a very warm disposition toward both precious metals and Bitcoin.\nBM: Can Bitcoin be divorced from its political implications? Can it be \u201cjust a payment system\u201d?\nEV: Interesting question. I think while the Bitcoin system, as a technology, is \u201capolitical,\u201d its ramifications cannot be divorced from politics or society at large. And while a socialist might rightly hail Bitcoin as an equalizing force (it is), the truth is that it equals out peoples\u2019 rights, not the result of their behavior. In other words, Bitcoin is highly individualistic, and robs power away from collectives and puts it in the hand of each person who cares to hold it.\nBeyond this, if Bitcoin succeeds it will inevitably cede power from governments, because much of a government\u2019s power comes from its ability to print and control the currency that its subjects use. I think it would be hard to argue that Bitcoin would pull society away from individual liberty, and as such it is very much a libertarian technology. Socialists have every right to use it of course, but they may find that by doing so they enable everyone else to use their own money in the way that they personally see fit. This is the antithesis of collectivism, and will hugely undermine the coercive power of the State.\nBM: When will we see the first major government attacks on Bitcoin? How much damage can they really do?\nEV: I think governments see Bitcoin as a problem in terms of money laundering, drugs, tax evasion, etc. For this, they will try to regulate it more closely. They will not try to downright attack Bitcoin for these offenses. What they will attack it for is when they realize that those offenses are just a distraction\u2026 for the real power of Bitcoin is that it will increasingly compete with government fiat currency. Bitcoin will pull in more and more business and incrementally the actors using it will discover less and less need for dollars or euros or yen. This happens gradually. At some point, however, the government will realize that this made-up magic internet money is wresting power away from their anointed currencies and they will then come down hard. When will this happen? I have no idea, but I imagine it will be too late, because it probably already is.\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that not all governments will act in tandem. It\u2019s possible that one regime will assault Bitcoin while others will be agnostic and others may even encourage it. Those regimes that clamp down hardest will simply squeeze an increasing amount of commerce over to those regimes that are friendly. Profits seek the path of least resistance and digital, frictionless currency is that path. Governments which attempt to abort this process will hamstring their competitiveness, and I fully expect some of them to be this foolish.\nBM: How many Bitcoin users are there right now in your estimation? When do you think that we will reach 10 million users, and what will it take to get us there?\nEV: My guess here is pretty anectodal and unscientific, but I\u2019d say there are a few million people who have used Bitcoin in some way. Then maybe 500k-1m who use it occasionally, and maybe a couple hundred thousand who use it frequently. Ten million \u201coccasional\u201d users will likely be reached within two years and that\u2019s probably about one order of magnitude higher than today.\nWhat will it take to get us there? More of the same. More businesses, easier tools, better security, and a sprinkling of time and luck.\nBM:\nEV: \nBitInstant\nCoinBase", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 26}
{"title": "Beef and Bitcoin", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/beef-and-bitcoin-1374822010/", "birthday": "Jul 26, 2013  3:00 AM EST", "date": "2013-07-26 08:00:00", "content": "If the level of participation shown by meetup attendance is a reliable indicator, Bitcoin interest appears to be rising in Argentina. The country\u2019s 25% annual inflation rate gives its residents a stronger incentive to consider Bitcoin as a safe haven than the residents of almost every other nation, and many observers have noted how Bitcoin is natural fit for the circumstances surrounding the inflation-plagued Argentine population.\nThere is one obstacle to overcome, however, before Bitcoin can enter Argentina or other nations with similar financial situations. Part of the reason that Bitcoin is so badly needed in Argentina is because of the strict capital controls which make it very expensive and difficult for average residents to move currency internationally. This presents a problem for Bitcoin adoption because presently most of the bitcoins in the world available for purchase are being offered in exchange for dollars or euros.\nThis barrier will be overcome as Bitcoin use begins to enter the next phase of the bootstrapping process, where its growth is driven by commerce rather than by currency speculation. In countries where the international movement of legacy currencies is restricted and expensive but tangible good are still allowed to cross the border in an outbound direction, it is this trade in tangible goods which presents the best avenue for Bitcoins to enter that nation\u2019s economy.\nContinuing with Argentina as an example, the most obvious entry point for Bitcoins is the beef exports. This product is in high demand around the world and represents a significant portion of their total export market. Here is an example of how a group of Bitcoin-aware entrepreneurs in Argentina might be able to connect the foreign demand for Argentine beef with the domestic demand for Bitcoins:\nThe first step would be to form a ARS (Argentine Peso) denominated investment fund. It would not need to be large to begin with, perhaps only enough to buy a few tons of beef at wholesale. The fund would buy beef from local farmers and sell it internationally to importers willing to pay with bitcoins, for a discount below the prevailing market price. The fund would then sell the received bitcoins to Argentinians, either via OTC trades or on a domestic exchange, and use the ARS they receive in order to fund the next shipment.\nAt first glance this does not appear to be a profitable activity, but with some reasonable and conservative assumptions it could end up to be quite lucrative for everyone involved. The following assumptions will apply for the rest of this article: the price of bitcoin in non-ARS currencies will remain stable, neither increasing nor decreasing by any significant amount, the devaluation of the ARS will continue at a constant 25% annual rate, and sufficient domestic demand for bitcoins exists and will grow at least the same rate as the fund\u2019s activities.\nWith these assumptions in place, we can assume that a bitcoin purchased today in Argentina will be worth 25% more in ARS terms one year from now, and 6.25% more three months from now. If Argentine bitcoin purchasers are willing to pay a 3.75% commission (a conservative assumption based on conditions on the ground), then it\u2019s reasonable to assume that a bitcoin received today could be sold for 10% more in three months. Once the fund managers can reasonably expect the bitcoins they receive as payment can be sold for a 10% profit in three months it makes sense for them to sell beef internationally at a discount, perhaps 3%, in order to convince importers to pay with bitcoins. Note that since the government of Argentina currently imposes a ill-advised export tax of 15% on beef, a reduction in the sale price of 3% actually results in a 3.45% discount to the importer.\nIf the fund can realize a net 7% profit by accepting bitcoins at a 3% discount and selling them three months later for 10% more, they could cycle through their working capital four times in a year, resulting 31% nominal profits and an 6% annual inflation-adjusted return. The only requirement is domestic demand for bitcoins grows sufficiently to absorb the bitcoins being sold by the fund.\nOf course, if any of the assumptions turned out to understate the demand for bitcoins in Argentina, or the growth in the exchange rate of Bitcoin internationally, the actual profitability of this fund could be substantially greater.\nNow we\u2019ve seen one possible way that bitcoin can enter the economies of the countries that need it most even if currency controls make it impossible to move legacy currencies out of those countries. Since there is no credible indication that currency controls are going start loosening any time soon, this form of arbitrage will eventually become the primary way in which Bitcoins can be traded internationally and will bring the world one step closer to the eventual obsolescence of legacy currencies.", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 26}
{"title": "SatoshiDice Sold for $12.4 Million", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/satoshidice-sold-124-million/", "birthday": "Jul 28, 2013  6:38 AM EST", "date": "2013-07-28 11:38:00", "content": "Erik Voorhees has announced that SatoshiDice, by far the most popular gambling site in the Bitcoin community, is being sold in full for 126315 BTC, worth $12.4 million USD at the time of the announcement. Holders of S-DICE shares on MPEX are entitled to receive their share of that, 0.00126315 BTC per share since each share represents a hundred-millionth of the company, but Voorhees has arranged to voluntarily reward shareholders with the larger amount of 0.0035 BTC per share. This higher price is equivalent to 277% of the 0.00126315 BTC to which shareholders are contractually entitled, 175% of the share price immediately before the buyout and roughly equal to the original S.DICE share price when SatoshiDice first had its initial public offering in 2012 (although a bitcoin was worth less than $15 then and is worth $80-$90 now).\n\nWhile I know some S.DICE owners intended to hold for a long time, Voorhees writes, and will thus be dismayed by the buyout, it is my sincere hope that this compensation level will be amenable. It is substantially higher than the contract mandates, and it is almost 3x higher than all private owners are being paid. It has not been easy to negotiate to this level, but I believe it is the right thing to do.\n\nSatoshiDice is now one of the largest businesses in the Bitcoin economy, beaten out by the mining company ASICMiner, worth roughly $150 million, and perhaps Bitcoin merchant and exchange juggernauts such as BitPay, BitInstant and Coinbase, all of which have received millions of dollars in investment. The companys success can be attributed to its simple interface: the site maintains a number of Bitcoin addresses, each representing a particular chance of winning, and users can simply send bitcoins to that address and immediately receive either the amount sent multiplied by a specific amount or a micro-payment to confirm that that particular bet lost. The most popular address, 1dice8EMZmqKvrGE4Qc9bUFf9PX3xaYDp, for example, has a 48% chance of returning double the amount sent. As a result of this simplicity, almost as soon as the site was first created it rose to become respoonsible for roughly half of all transactions on the Bitcoin network; even today, nine of the top ten Bitcoin addresses with the highest activity belong to SatoshiDice. More recently, SatoshiDice saw it in its legal interests to start blocking IP addresses originating inside the United States from accessing the site. The move sent share prices crashing down, but proved to be only a minor impediment to users seeking to make SatoshiDice bets; using SatoshiDice requires nothing more than a Bitcoin client and knowledge of what SatoshiDices addresses are, and the latter can be found simply by looking at blockchain.infos popular addresses page.\n\nThe site was also a major sponsor of the Porcfest event in New Hampshire this June; aside from that, however, over the past few months the site has somewhat faded into the background as more mainstream businesses like payment processors, exchanges and hedge funds entered the limelight. Voorhees himself has switched focus to Coinapult, a company in Panama whose sole function is currently allowing Bitcoin users to send bitcoins over email, but which soon intends to rapidly grow to serve functions such as merchant services and Bitcoin exchange essentially an equivalent of Coinbase serving customers outside the United States.\n\nSatoshiDice shareholders on MPEX should expect to receive their 0.0035 BTC payout in a series of payments over the course of the hours following the sale, and operators of pass-through services allowing Bitcoin users to indirectly invest in S.DICE on other exchanges such as Bitfunder are responsible for carrying forward the dividend to their users. Altogether, S.DICE investors have come out with a very good deal: despite the Bitcoin price rising by a factor of seven, those who invested in the original IPO are getting the same amount back that they put in, and can also keep their dividends over the course of the past year amounting to a total of 20% of the share price. Altogether, SatoshiDice was a highly successful example of what Bitcoin stock markets can do; ordinary people located anywhere around the world with as little as 0.0035 BTC to invest were able to financially participate in the development of the largest Bitcoin gambling site in existence. Businesses like Bitcoin Pride are taking advantage of the same opportunity, allowing them to crowd-fund tens of thousands of dollars of capital when doing so before would have required finding a single angel investor and giving them a considerable degree of control over ones business. As more businesses start using these kinds of micro-stock-markets, especially outside the United States as governments outside the US tend to have much less restrictive securities laws, both Bitcoin gambling and Bitcoin investment are proving to be very promising markets for the months ahead.", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 28}

{"title": "BaFin on Bitcoins \u2013 A Blueprint for Europe?", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bafin-on-bitcoins-a-blueprint-for-europe-2-1374962314/", "birthday": "Jul 27, 2013  5:58 PM EST", "date": "2013-07-27 22:58:00", "content": "In an oft overlooked statement German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) in December 2011 commented on Bitcoins. Although this statement directly concerns only Bitcoin businesses domiciled in Germany, one should be aware that BaFin is one of the most influential regulatory bodies in the EU. BaFin\u2018s statement could therefore be a blueprint for regulation in other European countries or EU regulation. Even if a particular Bitcoin business is not domiciled in Germany, it may be advisable for them to understand the BaFin statement and heed its possible consequences.The statement was contained in a guidance to the German Payment Services Supervision Act, one of the codes which transfers the EU Payment Services Directive (PSD) into German law. Bitcoin is analyzed with regard to its possible quality as e-money. Regarding this question BaFin comes to the same conclusion as the ECB in its analysis of virtual currencies of October 2012, namely that bitcoins do not constitute e-money. BaFin henceforth refers to bitcoins as \u201cunits of value\u201d (not \u201cunits of account\u201d as posted on some forums; \u201cunit of account\u201d is a technical term in finance law while \u201cunit of value\u201d does not carry any specific legal meaning).While the ECB goes on to say plainly that, by not being e-money, bitcoins \u201cclearly fall outside the scope of the Payment Services Directive\u201d, BaFin\u2019s wording is much more subtle and cautionary. It states that the \u201ccreation\u201d of bitcoins and their \u201cuse as medium of payment\u201d do not need a permit (license). However, regulation applicable to banks and financial services could be applicable to Bitcoin transactions under two conditions: (1) the bitcoins themselves become an \u201cobject of trade\u201d and (2) the \u201cstructure of the transaction\u201d justifies doing so. If these two criteria are met, bitcoins become \u201cunits of account\u201d and therefore \u201cby implication\u201d financial instruments.I think, based on the very careful wording of the statement, that BaFin is well aware that it is all but impossible to fully gauge the meaning of these two conditions. An \u201cobject of trade\u201d is not a technical term in finance law but comprises everything that is being traded, be it pork bellies, real estate or climate derivatives. I personally would assume that, for example, exchanging fiat currencies into Bitcoin and vice versa may make bitcoins an \u201cobject of trade\u201d. As for the \u201cstructure of the transaction\u201d one must probably look for the similarities between Bitcoin-based transactions and traditional banking and financial services transactions. Therefore it can only be assessed on a case-by-case basis whether a specific Bitcoin business model may come within the scope of banking or financial services regulation.The ECB\u2018s analysis of October 2012 that the PSD is not applicable does not \u201eover-rule\u201c this earlier statement of BaFin of December 2011 that laws based on the PSD or other laws pertaining to banks or financial services may be applicable. As long as there is no comprehensive EU regulation every country in the EU is free to regulate Bitcoin the way it deems fit. Even if the EU would begin to formulate Bitcoin-specific regulation it would probably take years before such regulation is enacted.I\u2018m afraid that this analysis of BaFin\u2018s statement cannot be conclusive and may therefore be slightly frustrating for Bitcoin businesses applying various business models and looking for clear guidance. For the time being though, regulatory matters in the Bitcoin space will remain in a state of flux. However, as one VC investor noted at this year\u2018s London Bitcoin Conference, this obscure regulatory environment also presents opportunities for those keen and nimble enough to cope with it.PS: Maybe bitcoin.de\u2018s collaboration with Fidor Bank in Germany will shed some more light on BaFin\u2018s thinking.", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 27}

{"title": "Bitcoin Self-Defense, Part 2: In-Person Transactions", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-self-defense-part-2-in-person-transactions-1374962215/", "birthday": "Jul 27, 2013  5:56 PM EST", "date": "2013-07-27 22:56:00", "content": "Image credit: http://spelunk.in/2013/07/14/los-angeles-bitcoin-meetup-2-writeup/\nSee also: Bitcoin Self-Defense, Part 1: Wallet Protection\nThe in-person Bitcoin economy is an exciting place to be. Ever since \u201cSatoshi Square\u201d, an in-person Bitcoin exchange event in New York City, had its first meeting in May, the popularity of trading bitcoins for cash, and for goods, in person has been growing exponentially. In the two months that followed, Satoshi Square spinoffs have been held in Los Angeles, Boston, Toronto and even, albeit without the \u201cSatoshi Square\u201d brand, Berlin. Bitcoin meetups in Argentina are seeing hundreds of people attending, excited about the currency\u2019s potential ability to help them protect themselves against inflation and tight capital controls. Wired ran an article entitled \u201cWhy the Only Real Way to Buy Bitcoins is on the Streets\u201c, and a journalist from Market Watch entitled his piece \u201cI walked into a bar and watched as people swapped thousands of dollars for bitcoins\u201d. These developments are highly positive; not only does in-person Bitcoin exchange help increase Bitcoin users\u2019 privacy in the face of regulations forcing nearly every exchange to demand personally identifying information from its users, but such events also help build community, establishing the Bitcoin ecosystem as a tightly linked parallel economy \u2013 in fact, a full-scale parallel society, where an increasing number of people are finding their hobbies, jobs, friends and products all at the same time.\nHowever, at the same time it is of the utmost importance to realize that in-person Bitcoin trade is not without its risks. As a Bitcoin user, there is a high probability that you come from an upper middle class, low-crime, background and spend sixteen hours a day in front of a computer. This type of lifestyle is certainly not in any way wrong or immoral; I myself am a product of such an upbringing. However, it does mean that you have so far been living a very sheltered life, and even the most basic of warning signs that experienced \u201cstreet kids\u201d take for granted will be simply lost on you. The risk of dealing with strangers is much lower than what media reports make us believe, but that does not mean that it will never happen; in fact, if you publicly establish yourself as a Bitcoin user carrying thousands of dollars worth of value in your digital wallet, the chance that something will happen to you may go up drastically. So far, we can be thankful that there have been only a few minor incidents of in-person Bitcoin crime taking place. When a major one does take place, however, that may seriously shake the public\u2019s confidence in the growing Bitcoin community \u2013 so by delaying that day through exercising caution and vigilance, it is not just you that stands to benefit.\nRisk 1: \u201cI never paid for that!\u201d\nThe following scam sounds too brazen and too simple for it could not possibly happen in practice, but two months ago it did. The story is this: a Bitcoin user was buying headphones from another in person in a restaurant. The seller gives his Bitcoin address, the buyer types it in, the seller confirms that it\u2019s correct, and the buyer hits send. Then, however, \u201cHe casually stands up, has the headphones, and walks away. I stand up pretty quick, and shout after to him, accusing him of theft. He says a quick comment around the lines of \u2018If you can\u2019t pay the price don\u2019t waste my time, I said $80\u2032 and walks out. I contemplate chasing after him, calling the police, or fuck maybe getting some public attention, then I realized I didn\u2019t have a leg to stand on. Cameras would show a guy sitting down at a table, showing me headphones, me inspecting them, then playing on a computer for a bit, with him walking off.\u201d\nIt is a common assumption that people make that being in public automatically makes less one more safe. In reality, however, this is far from always the case. The most notorious counterexample of all is the story of Kitty Genovese; as Wikipedia describes it:\nArriving home at about 3:15 am she parked in the Long Island Rail Road parking lot about 100 feet (30 m) from her apartment\u2019s door, located in an alley way at the rear of the building. As she walked towards the building she was approached by Winston Moseley. Frightened, Genovese began to run across the parking lot and towards the front of her building located on Austin Street trying to make it up to the corner towards the major thoroughfare of Lefferts Boulevard. Moseley ran after her, quickly overtook her and stabbed her twice in the back. Genovese screamed, \u201cOh my God, he stabbed me! Help me!\u201d Her cry was heard by several neighbors but, on a cold night with the windows closed, only a few of them recognized the sound as a cry for help. When Robert Mozer, one of the neighbors, shouted at the attacker, \u201cLet that girl alone!\u201d, Moseley ran away and Genovese slowly made her way toward the rear entrance of her apartment building. She was seriously injured, but now out of view of any witnesses \u2026 [A few hours later] Moseley proceeded to further attack her, stabbing her several more times. Knife wounds in her hands suggested that she attempted to defend herself from him. While Genovese lay dying, Moseley raped her. He stole about $49 from her and left her in the hallway. The attacks spanned approximately half an hour. A few minutes after the final attack a witness, Karl Ross, called the police. Police arrived within minutes of Ross\u2019 call. Genovese was taken away by ambulance at 4:15 am and died en route to the hospital. Later investigation by police and prosecutors revealed that approximately a dozen (but almost certainly not the 38 cited in the Times article) individuals nearby had heard or observed portions of the attack, though none saw or were aware of the entire incident. Only one witness, Joseph Fink, was aware she was stabbed in the first attack, and only Karl Ross was aware of it in the second attack. Many were entirely unaware that an assault or homicide was in progress; some thought that what they saw or heard was a lovers\u2019 quarrel or a drunken brawl or a group of friends leaving the bar.\nA common reaction is to attribute the witnesses\u2019 inaction to some form of human callousness and depravity; in reality, however, it was not a willingness to act, but the lack of knowledge that there was something to be acted on, that takes greater responsibility for the tragedy. The headphone thief was banking on precisely this sociopsychological result. From the buyer\u2019s point of view, and the point of view of outsiders having the full information of the incident after the fact, the seller was obviously guilty of fraud, and the buyer subconsciously expected the rest of the restaurant patrons to share the perspective. In reality, however, as the buyer realized seconds too late the other patrons had no way of knowing who was actually in the right.\nMitigation\nA perfect solution here is in fact something that the Bitcoin community is doing already: Satoshi Square meetups. Rather than meeting up to make trades in anonymous restaurants, what safer place is there to make a Bitcoin sale than in the middle of dozens of experienced Bitcoin users doing the exact same thing? Satoshi Square events could become not just the hub of Bitcoin for fiat exchanges, but also a recurring, ephemeral flea market for people selling used goods. In most cases, finding a buyer for some esoteric product is difficult among a few dozen traders, so the buyer and seller would need to make an agreement online beforehand, but as a place to meet Satoshi Square is the perfect candidate. If you are going to meet on your own, be sure to plan ahead, and know exactly what you are going to do if the counterparty turns out to be less honest than you had thought. Make sure the product is in your hands, or at least on the table, before you make the payment.\nRisk 2: Outright Mugging\nFortunately, a true Bitcoin mugging has not happened yet. The closest thing we have is a story of questionable veracity from a German Bitcoin trader who claimed to have bought 60 BTC in person for $4500, and was then beaten and robbed by the seller of his cash, laptop, smartphone and watch. The attacker was unable to recover the bitcoins, but the victim also lost them because the fifteen-character Blockchain.info password was stored only on his laptop. In general, regardless of whether it is true this story is not particularly instructive, except as a reminder to keep many backups; aside from the incidental loss, it was little more than a conventional mugging. The more interesting question is, how would an attacker rob a victim of their bitcoins?\nThe main challenge in a hypothetical Bitcoin mugging is not the coercion; if the attacker knows how many bitcoins you have, it is easy for them to keep whacking you with a five-dollar wrench until you cough up the wallet password. Rather, the challenge is figuring out how much you have in the first place. In theory, Bitcoin has the potential to provide a very high level of privacy to its users and thwart many attempts at de-anonymization. In practice, however, if you do not take precautions breaking privacy can be quite easy. The attack is this: first, the attacker sells the victim some trivial item (eg. $10 USD) for bitcoins, and lets the victim make the payment. Then, the attacker takes advantage of a key insight: if a transaction has inputs coming from multiple addresses, those addresses are all probably owned by the same person. Starting from the address the victim used to send the payment and iteratively applying this process, the attacker computes a set of addresses called a \u201cclosure\u201d, that are quite likely all owned by the victim. Tools exist to do this automatically. This provides a lower bound on the victim\u2019s Bitcoin wealth, and is used to weed out low-net-Bitcoin-worth individuals. When the attacker finds a high-net-Bitcoin-worth victim, they can then follow them into a dark alley and demand their private keys. Sometimes the attack is much simpler: simply look over potential victims\u2019 shoulders and see if anyone has more than $5000 worth of BTC. Even worse, the coercion step may not even be necessary \u2013 simply shoulder surf) to get the password (including the computer\u2019s screen lock password), physically whack the victim one or two times to get the computer, and input the data yourself.\nMitigation\nThe best defense against such attacks in general is to keep multiple wallets: one spending wallet and one savings wallet. The spending wallet should be optimized for convenience, whereas the savings wallet should store the bulk of one\u2019s funds and be used only occasionally. Consider sending your bitcoins from the savings wallet to the spending wallet through a proxy to keep the savings wallet anonymous; for example, deposit from the savings wallet to an exchange or gambling site, and then withdraw those same funds to your spending wallet. The process usually does not link the two in the blockchain. Even if you do not take this extra step, however, this wallet separation will still help massively \u2013 you can keep the keys to your savings wallet printed on paper at home, and even if you do not you can still claim that you do, and potential muggers would not have any way of getting anything out of you beyond what\u2019s left of your spending wallet.\nSometimes you might need to get your savings wallet out at Satoshi Square; many people want to trade thousands of dollars worth of bitcoins, and you can earn a healthy commission by making these trades both ways at a one or two percent fee. This is okay; as long as you are in Satoshi Square the presence of dozens of other Bitcoin users around you protects you. Once you leave, however, you are vulnerable to being followed as a high-value target; the best safety tip here is simply to send all remaining bitcoins to another wallet which you can only access from home (or pretend that you can only access from home) once the event ends. If your defense is based on pretending, it is best to set it up so that potential muggers get at least some small amount like 0.095 BTC; this presents a much more convincing case that that is really all you have. Anything that looks like blatant resistance is an easy way to get yourself hurt.\nConclusion\nMost of you will never have to deal with any of these issues. Crime is fortunately an increasingly rare occurrence in the developed world, and many people go through their entire lives without ever seeing anyone in person that is genuinely interested in harming them physically or financially for personal gain. However, eventually some kind of incident will happen, and if it does it is much better to be prepared. All safety is fundamentally about risk mitigation; no measure is guaranteed to protect you, and outright avoiding offline trade out of fear of being defrauded will not help anyone. However, there are certain basic measures of protection that we can take: stick together when possible, don\u2019t carry thousands of dollars in an insecure wallet, don\u2019t publicly advertise that you are carrying thousands of dollars even in a secure wallet if you can open it, and everything will very probably be fine. All in all, it is better to be vigilant earlier rather than later.", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 27}

Now, the situation appears to have taken a considerable step toward resolution. Today, the exchange has received its money services business (MSB) license from FinCEN, the federal money transmission regulator in the United States. The license document can be found on FinCEN\u2019s website by searching for MtGox\u2019s registration number, 31000029348132.\nThe license lists MtGox as intending to carry out money services business activities in sixty US territories including all fifty states, granting the company federal permission to carry out their Bitcoin exchange activities in all of those regions (although the exchange still needs money transmitter licenses from forty eight states just like all other exchanges in the US; these are much harder to obtain, although certainly not impossible. Notably, the license specifically lists MtGox, Inc and not Mutum Sigillum LLC; this is not a mistake, as MtGox set up a new Delaware corporation with that name on June 11, presumably intending to use it for all Bitcoin exchange-related activities in the United States in the near future.\nSince MtGox has received the MSB license, it can be assumed that they are simultaneously working with the Department of Homeland Security to resolve that agency\u2019s Dwolla complaint. However, there is still one major thorn in MtGox\u2019s side that remains unresolved: the Coinlab deal. On February 27, MtGox announced a deal with Coinlab in which Coinlab would take over MtGox\u2019s activities in the United States, but in the months that followed it appears that MtGox procrastinated on their side of the agreement, leading to Coinlab suing them for contract violation on May 2. Perhaps MtGox intends to make amends with Coinlab and follow through on the agreement, in which case MtGox would not need to bother with money transmitter licenses; that would be Coinlab\u2019s respnsibility. Alternatively, MtGox may be setting itself up to forge ahead in the United States on its own; the decision to create a new Delaware corporation can certainly be interpreted as evidence pointing at least slightly toward that conclusion.\nAlthough MtGox\u2019s recent legal and banking debacles, culminating with their recent decision to suspend all USD withdrawals, have led to serious difficulties for the exchange, its market share is remaining surprisingly resilient at 65-70% \u2013 much lower than the 75-90% the exchange was used to before the sudden rise in Bitcoin price and popularity earlier this year, but higher than the more extreme predictions of MtGox doomsayers these past two months, myself included. Perhaps the engine still has quite a bit of steam left inside.", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 29}

While Bitcoin 2013 was a conference generally intended for fans of Bitcoin in general, and Porcfest an event for libertarians, most of whom were just starting to use Bitcoin, BTC London was targeted to a very specific group of people: wealthy individuals who are already heavily involved in investment or finance, and are interested in Bitcoin businesses as their next investment. The fee for the conference was high, at 250 GBP ($400) for pre-registration and 500 GBP ($800) on-site, a massive figure compared to the $300 for the Bitcoin conference and $75 for Porcfest \u2013 even more so since the conference lasted only a single day. But the fee fulfilled its purpose; the only people attending were those with businesses to show, or tens of thousands of dollars to invest in them.\nAside from an energetic opening speech from Tuur Demeester and a few spirited remarks by Erik Voorhees, the ideological side of the Bitcoin community was almost entirely lacking; the overarching theme of the conference was an attempt to answer the single question of where the largest opportunities for growth in the Bitcoin space are and how to invest in them. To some, this is a sign of stale government-corporatism creeping its way back in as usual, and will lead to Bitcoin becoming little more than another PayPal; to others, it is an inevitable sign, and precondition, of genuine progress.\nWhat was perhaps the most impressive aspect of the conference was the sheer number of start-ups that were present there. An entire two presentations were simply panel discussions with five start-up owners each talking about their businesses; wallets, exchanges and mining firms of various sorts (as well as Icelandic data centers to host them) all played their part. There was also a large media presence featuring both major Bitcoin-related news sources (including Bitcoin Magazine ourselves) and outside reporters from, among others, the Financial Times and TechCrunch.\nHere are some of the more interesting businesses that were at the scene:\nBridgeWalker is a Bitcoin wallet which integrates a Bitcoin exchange behind the scenes, allowing users to make and receive Bitcoin payments while still keeping their balance constant in the fiat currency of their choice. To pay for the cost of the exchange trades, Bridgewalker charges a fee of 0.75% per transaction, which will go down as the service becomes more popular and volume increases.Hive is a Bitcoin Wallet that attempts to take the idea of being designed with ease of use in mind one step further. Rather than thinking of how a Bitcoin transaction works from a technical standpoint and trying to create the best possible interface to express the various details, Hive\u2019s design started by creating the interface first and fitting Bitcoin in later. In the words of its founder, Wendell Davis, \u201cI asked the graphic designer to make a payment application that would be easy to use and we would fit the Bitcoin in later. He barely knew what Bitcoin was, and this is what he came up with.\u201d The result: an application which allows you to select people to pay to simply by clicking on their faces in a contacts screen, and for which one can build \u201cBitcoin apps\u201d like BitcoinStore and SatoshiDice.Bex.io is a company based in Vancouver that seeks to do the same thing that BTCGlobal is: commoditize the BItcoin exchange. The company\u2019s ultimate vision is that they would handle all of the aspects of Bitcoin exchange that are easy to replicate, of which the trading engine and security is the largest, and first, step, and leave it to exchanges to attract customers and interact with local banking and regulatory systems. The trading engines will be run on Bex\u2019s servers in-house, and exchanges will be able to interface with it via an API. Bex will also include a system for clearing buy and sell orders between multiple exchanges using their platform (at least within the same currency), and will eventually include a colored coins-based system for keeping track of fiat balances. Bex\u2019s service is expected to come online at some point this fall.MetalAir is a company seeking to create a decentralized Bitcoin exchange. The process of buying and selling will roughly work as follows: first the Bitcoin seller makes a transaction sending the bitcoins to a 2-of-3 multisignature address between himself, the buyer and an escrow agent. Then, the buyer sends the fiat directly to the seller by bank wire or whatever other mechanism. Finally, the buyer and the seller \u2013 or, if necessary, the buyer and the escrow agent, sign a transaction to transfer the bitcoins from the multisignature address to the buyer. MetalAir themselves will be an escrow agent, but theoretically anyone with a reputation could be. MetalAir will also support cryptocurrency-to-cryptocurrency exchange with a higher guarantee of security, as both sides of the exchange could be done via multisignature transactions.CoinX is an exchange created by Megan Burton with the intent of being enterprise-ready, security and compliance and all, right from the start. The exchange will offer a fee structure biased in favor of liquidity providers in order to encourage stability, two redundant servers to guarantee uptime, and is heavily focused on being compliant with money transmitter regulations in all of the states that have the relevant regulation. The exchange will open around the end of July.MiiCard is a platform that intends to replace expensive and privacy-eroding photo identity checks with a much simpler means of customer verification. Customers of exchanges would verify themselves by logging in with their MiiCard, and the MiiCard itself verifies users by checking that they have a verified bank account. The bank account itself presumably exists only if the bank verified the customer\u2019s identity through photo ID. It turns out that under current US law this is legal; federal rule 103.121 (ii) b. allows \u201cverification through non-documentary methods\u201d that \u201cmay include contacting a customer, independently verifying the customer\u2019s identity through the comparison of information obtained from a consumer reporting agency, public database or other source, checking references with other financial institutions, and obtaining a financial statement.\u201d MiiCard ensures that the customer has a relationship with another financial institution and acts as this \u201cother source\u201d.Kipochi is a feature phone (or \u201cdumb phone\u201d) compatible Bitcoin wallet intended for customers around the world, allowing them to send and receive bitcoins with nothing but a mobile phone connection. The wallet will be heavily marketed to users in Africa and particularly Kenya; a major use case, founder Pelle Braendgaard believes, will be sending money out of the country. Although we often think of Kenya as simply being part of Africa, the poor continent to which remittances are sent, in reality it is one of the more developed countries in the region, and many people go to Kenya due to the better economic prospects there and then send money back to their families. Two weeks ago, Kipochi introduced a feature that allows users to exchange money in M-Pesa, a popular mobile banking system in Kenya, for bitcoins.\nThere were also a few major announcements at the conference. OpenCoin\u2019s Stefan Thomas announced that the Ripple client now has a built-in feature that allows users to send money directly to a Bitcoin address. From the Bitcoin Foundation, Peter Vessenes made two announcements. First, he will soon be stepping down from his role in the foundation. Second, the foundation aims to expand internationally, and is looking for people who wish to set up local chapters of the foundation. The way the relationship would work is that the local chapter would help raise funds for its parent organization, and would gain access to the larger organization\u2019s brand and support in exchange.\nThe next Bitcoin conference to take place is MediaBistro\u2019s Inside Bitcoins conference in New York City on July 30; this will once again be a one-day event heavily focused on the investment community, although this time it will be the investment community in New York City rather than London (although Bitcoiners will, as usual, come from all over the world). The one large conference remaining this year will be unSYSTEM, taking place in Vienna this November. See you at the next few conferences!", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 3}
{"title": "Germany Provides Leadership for Bitcoin Tax Clarity", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/germany-provides-leadership-for-bitcoin-tax-clarity-1372381025/", "birthday": "Jun 27, 2013  8:57 PM EST", "date": "2013-06-28 01:57:00", "content": "If the American IRS is looking for precedent for their upcoming tax guidelines related to bitcoin, they can now look to Germany. An inquest from the Bundestag(German Parliament) reported in the German language publication Die Welt declared that profits from the sale of bitcoins held as an investment are exempt from taxation if the coins are held for over one year.\nThe inquest was initiated at the request of Bundestag Finance Committee member Frank Sch\u00e4ffler of the Free Democrat Party (FDP) who has expressed interest in bitcoin as a means to counterbalance the existing financial system. Sch\u00e4ffler is noted for criticizing the European Central Bank(ECB) as criminally accountable for its actions related to the Cypriot bank bailouts, noting that if the ECB were a private institution, its president would likely face prosecution.\nThis parliamentary ruling defines bitcoins as a privately held movable asset which as a classification are subject to capital gains tax only if the asset is sold within a year of purchase. Subject to minor stipulations, bitcoins sold for profit as an investment before the one year mark would be subject to a 25% capital gains flat tax. If bitcoins are sold more than a year after they are bought, the gains are tax-exempt.\nIn the United States, the Internal Revenue Service is currently conducting an assessment at the behest of congressional agency the Government Accountability Office of what guidelines to provide American taxpayers with in regards to bitcoin taxation. While the GAO report into bitcoin taxation provided an outline of how bitcoin works and what tax issues may arise, the burden of defining what tax regulations apply to bitcoin falls squarely on the IRS. This perplexity is not unique to the United States. Anywhere bitcoin has developed a significant usership, government revenue agencies are puzzling over how to interact with the new economy. The Bundestag\u2019s research into how bitcoin should be integrated into current tax law provides a helpful resource for these agencies to craft rules unique to each country.\nOne issue that the report on the Bundestag\u2019s discovery did not immediately make clear, however, is how tax law should treat bitcoin when not used solely as an investment vehicle. While perhaps initially the most common usage of bitcoin in the financial world was as a trading avenue, other areas are rapidly increasing. With the recent influx of venture capital interest into bitcoin, the number of companies that accept bitcoin as payment for goods and services is growing. By extension, the number of people receiving a paycheck denominated in bitcoin is also increasing.\nThese two areas, the classification of bitcoin as it relates to sales and income, provide unique challenges for the leadership of revenue agencies due the wide ranging attributes of bitcoin. This uncertainty also inhibits some businesses and individuals from accepting bitcoin as payment or salary. The solutions, however, do not have to be complex. With the definition from Germany as an example, crafting tax policy becomes easier.\nOne way to handle the income tax part of the problem would be to separate the income into two portions. The first part, the initial paycheck, would be taxed under existing income tax rules based on the average exchange rate for the pay period. This leaves the problem of how to handle exchange rate fluctuation. The solution to that would be to treat any value increase that occurs on top of the baseline exchange rate at the time of the paycheck as a capital gain. This would mean that if the value of bitcoin increased rapidly from the time the paycheck was received until either the bitcoins were sold, or until the end of the tax year, two separate taxes would apply. Income tax for the initial paycheck, and capital gains for any increase (or decrease) thereafter.\nA similar solution would work for issue of business revenue. Sales tax, or applicable tax for whatever service the business provides, would be decided based the exchange for a defined set of dates during which the tax liability was incurred. Any fluctuation afterwards would be ruled by capital gains regulation.\nWhile this is not a comprehensive analysis of the issues involved, it does create an outline for potential tax rules. Germany\u2019s proactive initiative in producing bitcoin tax guidelines for their citizens provides a clear mandate for other countries to follow suit. The IRS and its counterparts in other nations would do well to prioritize similar solutions.", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 28}

Douglas Feigelson, the founder of BitBills, filed a patent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on December 23, 2011. Just last Saturday, June 27, 2013, the USPTO processed Feigelson\u2019s application and entitled the application for a patent as, \u201cCreating and Using Digital Currency.\u201d There is much concern within the Bitcoin community that such a patent, if approved, could potentially restrict further hardware Bitcoin wallet development. \u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s Talk Bitcoin,\u201d highlighted the connection between the patent and BitBills\u2019s cold storage concept. \u00a0Additionally, we can question what the further implications of a patent description including the world, \u201cBitcoin\u201d might mean. \u00a0Currently, the Bitcoin community is unique and thriving due to an openness to ingenuity, development of new products and the betterment of existing products and Bitcoin accessories.\nWhat are BitBills?\nOn May 9, 2011, the first BitBill was launched. BitBills preceded Casascius coins as the first physical form of Bitcoins. As plastic cards, BitBills store Bitcoin and provide individuals with an opportunity to not only store Bitcoins but also trade Bitcoins. \u00a0Along with each BitBill, a new Bitcoin address is created to provide a user a place to store Bitcoins and also a QR code to receive and transfer Bitcoins. \u00a0As security is key for BitBills and other physical manifestations of the Bitcoin currency, Bitbills are secured through anti-counterfeiting and tamper-evidence. \u00a0As each BitBill contains a security hologram and an embedded private key, it is next to impossible to counterfeit a BitBill.\nProtection of Ingenuity is Key\nAre BitBills an asset to the Bitcoin community? YES! Yet, BitBills are not significant enough to merit a compromise of one of the founding principles surrounding the Bitcoin community: INGENUITY. As Feigelson took the step to request a patent for his BitBills, several in the Bitcoin community are concerned about what this might mean for future opportunities to readily update and improve hardware wallets. With a USPTO stamp of approval on Feigelson\u2019s patent application, members of the Bitcoin community will be restricted in some capacities of improving Feigelson\u2019s design and also building off of BitBills to develop an even more secure and efficient wallet.\nBitcoin has thrived in part due to the limited government involvement to date in the Bitcoin currency and hardware involving Bitcoin. Feigelson\u2019s request for a patent is one of the first steps to bring the United States\u2019s Federal Government into the Bitcoin space. There will most likely come a time when the US Federal Government will take larger steps to get involved and regulate the Bitcoin currency, but the Bitcoin community would not want such involvement to take place prematurely.\nAlways be Mindful of Unintended Consequences\nCertainly, Feigelson\u2019s development of BitBills has worked for the betterment of the Bitcoin community. However, prior to proactively involving the US Federal Government in the Bitcoin space, he should understand the several unintended consequences of such a step. Protecting one\u2019s work definitely makes sense, but one should be mindful that such actions may deter development and growth of a currently flourishing Bitcoin community. What will come of Feigelson\u2019s patent request? \u00a0Since this affects everyone in the community, make your voice heard. \u00a0\u00a0Do you agree with Douglas Feigelson\u2019s attempt to secure a patent for BitBills? \nMake your voice heard!\u00a0 We do not know, but we can hope that the free market, limited government, ingenuity \u00a0and promoting spirit of the Bitcoin community will not be squelched.", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 2}

If approved the SEC Filing will open Bitcoin up to Wall Street, 401ks, and tons of individuals around the world who had previously avoided the buying and selling of Bitcoin due to the lack of accessibility of this digital, decentralized, cryptocurrency.\nImagine how this filing might transform the Bitcoin community and even more so make Bitcoin a household name, not just for those on Wall Street but also individuals around the world who are interested in investing in a currency with great potential for growth. After the US Department of Homeland Security freeze of Mt. Gox\u2019s Dwolla account back in May, the ability for individuals to buy and sell Bitcoins in particular within the US has been more difficult. For many businesses accepting Bitcoin and then needing to in turn exchange Bitcoin for USD or other currencies, the Mt. Gox/Dwolla debacle has held up ease of exchange and transaction and left the the price of Bitcoin at a lower point than previous peaks in April and May.\nWith this announcement from the Winklevoss Twins, there is great hope for an increase in the price of Bitcoin, not just in the short term, but in the long run with an increase in individuals buying and selling the currency and further more businesses choosing to accept Bitcoin. Bitcoin continues to reel in venture capitalists and those with free market, entrepreneurial outlooks on the world.

With the potential of 20 million dollars worth of shares available, individuals interested in taking part in this venture and purchasing stock in Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust will look forward to seeing a rise in the utility and price of Bitcoin should this SEC Filing be approved.\nAs Bitcoin continues to grow in prominence, a position on Wall Street will continue to propel this alternative blossoming cryptocurrency to another level of significance. As many US and international citizens already purchase stocks online with relative ease, this SEC filing opens the door to allow Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust to sell stocks in the same manner and open the door to many more individuals investing and transacting in Bitcoin. This is yet another step in the right direction and another huge opportunity for Bitcoin to flourish! What\u2019s next?

It differs from other mainstream mining companies, including Butterfly Labs, Avalon and even new entrants like KnCMiner in that, rather than only selling devices, the company predominantly mines its own hardware and raised its startup capital by selling shares. The company first launched with an IPO on the now-defunct Global Bitcoin Stock Exchange (GLBSE) in August 2012, and shares sold out within hours. It then immediately set to work on developing application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) specially designed for Bitcoin mining; although such chips will never be useful for anything but making SHA256 computations and as scrap metal, they would be ten to fifty times faster than anything else that was available at the time.\nThe company\u2019s first finished ASICs turned on in February, shortly after Avalon shipped their own, but quickly overtook Avalon due to shipping delays. The conjectures of the potential power of ASICs proved to be correct; the first Avalon device to make its way to a consumer paid for itself within nine days, and ASICMiner\u2019s ASICs were similarly successful. A few months later, due to a combination of its success in manufacturing the devices and the sudden rise in the Bitcoin price, the company realized that it had far more money than it had anticipated, and would not have the space to mine all the devices that it could produce in house; thus, ASICMiner\u2019s first actual products, the ASICMiner Block Erupter USB and ASICMiner Block Erupter Blade, were born.\nThe company is also notable for having no online presence beyond a few threads on the Bitcointalk forum; it has been jokingly (although falsely) described as \u201cthe world\u2019s first hundred-million dollar company without a website\u201d. This was not much of a problem at first, as the Bitcoin investment community was essentially based on the Bitcointalk forum in 2012. Now, however, large numbers of people are interested in buying ASICMiner hardware but are turned off by the fact that the only way to by them at first was through forum-based auctions, and so the move to selling through a normal website, at least through third-party resellers, is very welcome.\nThose interested in buying ASICs should be careful to shop around for the best deals; ASICMiner\u2019s Block Erupter USB, for example, provides 336 MH/s for 1 BTC \u2013 paying for itself in 250 days if network hashpower remains at the 150 TH/s level that it is today. More likely, network hashpower will be as high as 500 TH/s by September, so it is quite likely that buyers will not even recoup half of their costs. ASICMiner shares, offering 0.4-1% dividends per week, may be a better bet, as shares imply partial ownership of future ASICMiner technology as well. KnCMiner offers mining devices priced as low as 1 GH/s for $19, although they will not be shipping until at least September.\nHappy mining!", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 29}

With Bitcoin, transaction costs pale in comparison to those of credit and debit card fees. Featuring Adam Sah\u2019s business, in Buyer\u2019s Best Friend Wholesale & Mercantile stores, WSJ writer, Sarah E. Needleman, touched upon the intrigue of the virtual currency. Extended beyond small business owners, venture capitalists are intrigued by the growth potential of the Bitcoin currency and have invested millions of dollars in various Bitcoin related start-ups.\nThe Bitcoin currency provides an opportunity for all types of small businesses ranging from food services to wholesale shops to transportation and travel companies to most recently cosmetic surgery centers. Just today, Elite Body Sculpture of Beverly Hills and Sacramento, CA signed up to be a merchant of BitPay, Inc, the leading Bitcoin payment processing company. Dr. Aaron Rollins of Elite Body Sculpture shared with the Wall Street Journal that several of his clients asked if he accepted Bitcoin. Once he drew the contrast between the simplicity of Bitcoin compared to the hassle of using cash, Dr. Rollins looked further into the Bitcoin currency and now will work through BitPay to process payments in BTC.\nAs small businesses serve as the backbone of the United States\u2019 and most economies, Bitcoin is a credible solution to the woes of small businesses. Just last year, when both Chambers of Congress and the Executive Branch struggled to establish a fundamental budget, the US House, Senate and President supported and signed into law the Jumpstart Our Businesses Startups Act (JOBS Act, H.R. 3606) to enhance the ability of small businesses to increase capital. The JOBS Act highlights the critical role small businesses and emerging growth companies play in stimulating job growth and the US economy.\nAs the House, Senate and President backed the JOBS Act in the 112th Congress and are now implementing this pro-growth legislation, further consideration of the Bitcoin currency should be on the books for the 113th Congress. As the Small Business Administration sizes up options to best facilitate small business growth, a consideration of the Bitcoin currency will be a wise investment of resources. What if the Small Business Administration decided to revamp the already existing grant and loan program with a track for businesses utilizing the Bitcoin currency? Business owners would have greater leeway in finding the best methods of transaction not only to meet customer needs but also to efficiently collect revenue and in turn stimulate the economy.\nWith many vendors and small businesses already processing payments through iPads and updated computer systems, imagine how simple it would be for customers and business owners to make transactions at any price with the simple scanning of a QR code. Let\u2019s take this a step further. Small businesses and merchants reaching out to an international audience will avoid high currency exchange rates as Bitcoin is a decentralized and international currency.\nThe answer to small business woes in the US and around the world is a no-brainer: Bitcoin!", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 28}

Arguments are made that figuring out who can be linked to which address through the blockchain will be quite easy once competent mathematicians start seriously working on the problem, or that Bitcoin\u2019s privacy properties can effectively be reined in by requiring identification at the exchanges. No matter which particular path one takes, the point that anything more than a moderate degree of financial privacy is bad for everyone but criminals is conceded, and the debate immediately shifts to how easily Bitcoin in particular can be bent to look more like what government intelligence agencies want.\nThis article will attempt to take a completely different tack. Rather than debating the merits of Bitcoin in particular, and ignoring the potential of other technologies like centralized and decentralized mixers, Chaumian blinding and Zerocoin (many of which can potentially be layered on top of even existing mainstream platforms like Paypal), another alternative is, for the moment, assuming that hyper-efficient anonymous payment mechanisms are here to stay, but also exploring the positive consequences that we might see as a result.\nTaxation is one major point of contention. It is often assumed that anonymous payment mechanisms will make life difficult for governments, because it will be impossible to collect taxes. In the case of income and sales taxes on purely digital goods, that is certainly true; if I were to sell a copy of my book pseudonymously online over Tor for 0.0238 bitcoins, anonymized with three different mixers before and after the sale, no one but myself and the buyer would be able to know that the transaction even took place. As for physical goods, although the effect of increased privacy in the digital world will at least partially be offset by increased surveillance in the physical world, once again with anonymous money it will be more difficult to collect taxes to some degree than it would without.\nNearly everyone, both those in favor of increased financial privacy and those against, agree with the above statements; the main disagreements have to do with, one the one hand, the extent of each of the particular effects, and, on the other hand, the desirability of taxation in the first place. However, there is one piece of the puzzle that, so far, the conversation is entirely missing. And that is: hyper-efficient, anonymous money (the two go hand in hand; systems like Zerocoin and decentralized mixers can be applied to any payment system with sufficiently low fees and cryptographically secure transactions) does not just weaken governments\u2019 power to collect revenue; in fact, they open the door for innovative, radically new forms of government financing that would not be otherwise even possible.\nRoad Tolls\nAs every urban planner knows, road congestion is one of the largest problems that the modern city has to face. As soon as enough people move into a particular area that it starts to become a downtown, roads on the inside of the region, and often the highways leading in, slow to a crawl as hundreds of thousands of drivers all struggle to get to and from work at almost the exact same hours each day. Widening highways and roads works, but only up to a point; as soon as such a project is done, the roads once again become more tolerable, more people set up their homes and offices in the region as a result, and soon enough the problem is right back where it started. Public transport is a solution, but buses and subways are often slower and, according to some, less comfortable than cars, and so people often end up avoiding public transit even if it would be better for society as a whole if everyone did not.\nThe key reason for the discrepancy is simple: externalized costs. When you are driving a car, there are a large number of costs that you end up having to pay. Many of these costs are borne by you personally; you need to buy the car to start driving in the first place, pay an additional fee every month for insurance, and finally pay for every kilometer that you drive at the gas station. But there are also other costs that are not paid by you personally, but are rather imposed on all of society. The example most people immediately think of is environmental costs, and these certainly do exist, but in an urban environment they are arguably not even close to the greatest issue. The greatest issue, in fact, is much more mundane: by driving a car on a road, you are taking up space. High-traffic roads are slower, and less pleasant, than low-traffic roads, and the pattern is continuous; every single driver that adds themselves to the flow of traffic is making life worse for evertone else who is sharing the road with them.\nNormally, when an activity is demonstrably \u201cbad\u201d, the solution is to simply ban it, but in this case that is obviously not a practical solution; some drivers on the road are using the road for a very good reason, and there is a natural equilibrium between having the maximum possible number of drivers on the road, and ensuring the best possible conditions for each one, that would deliver optimal results for society as a whole. However, under ordinary conditions we have a problem: the \u201cfree market\u201d does not reach this balance. The reason is that roads are not a market at all; if your car had to compensate every other driver for the harm that it caused by taking up space on the road, just as you must compensate the grocer when you buy an apple, then it would closely approximate a traditional market, and, if the prices were right, produce the optimal result: a new car would only enter the road if the benefits to itself were greater than the cost to everyone else. Now, however, drivers enter the road if the net benefit to themselves is simply greater than zero \u2013 producing roads with far more congestion than necessary.\nThe first solution that one might come up with to this problem is gas taxes. Add a surcharge to every liter of gas that drivers buy, and if the charge is high enough road usage will considerably reduce as a result. The problem with this solution is, however, that not all kilometers are created equal. Driving at night imposes almost no costs on anyone else, as there is no one else around, while driving at peak time is highly problematic. Similarly, driving along a road relatively far from, and perpendicular to, the downtown is far less of an issue than driving in the middle of it. Gas taxes fail to grasp these nuances, and so, if they are effective at reducing congestion at peak hours, may accidentally massively overshoot the target at night. Another solution is downtown parking levies, which are more efficient, but even still such solutions cannot rapidly adapt to changing circumstances, unexpected traffic jams or fine changes to driving patterns. For example, a hypothetical altruist driver wishing to avoid causing pain to everyone else coming to work around 8:00-9:00 and leaving around 17:00 to 18:00 by coming at 6:00-7:00 and leaving at 15:00-16:00, but they would still end up paying most of the downtown levy. Such levies also do nothing to stop the problem of people driving through high-traffic areas (people would still avoid them to some degree due to their own desire to avoid traffic, but, as described above, this level of avoidance is far below optimal), and fail completely when areas where more traffic is acceptable and where more traffic is not acceptable are right beside each other (eg. a high-traffic city street passing through a residential area).\nThe one solution that stands out above all others is road tolls. Passing through some stretch of Main Street might cost 8 cents per 100 meters at 8:00-9:00 on weekdays, but only 4.5 cents per 100 meters at 9:00-10:00. At night, there might be no toll at all, or perhaps the city may wish to still charge a toll to compensate for the noise pollution against nearby residents trying to sleep. If traffic on some road is higher than expected, no matter what the reason, cameras can catch that and double the toll immediately. Google Maps could integrate with the tolling system in order to find an optimal path that tries to save money as well as time, guiding users toward those roads that are socially optimal, and in the future self-driving cars could work with the system completely automatically.\nIf such a system is indeed as poweful as I have described, the question is: why hasn\u2019t every city done it already? There are three problems. First is lack of infrastructure. Road tolls of this sort would require electronic payment handling devices at essentially every intersection, requiring hundreds of millions of dollars of initial investment that not all municipalities are capable of. Second is lack of standardization. If cities started to set up such systems independently, each one would be incompatible with the others, making life very difficult for anyone who does not simply stay in one place. Notably, the most famous municipality that does implement this kind of tolling, Singapore, is located sufficiently far away from other developed cities, and even further from other developed cities where most people speak English, that everyone who lives there essentially does simply stay (or at least keep their car) in one place. Third, and for some most important, is privacy. Under all of the systems that are currently available, an unavoidable secondary consequence of such effective universal road tolls is that everyone is being tracked everywhere they drive. Singapore\u2019s relatively authoritarian government can afford to ignore most privacy concerns without raising an eyebrow, but implementing a Singaporean system in cities with a more democratically minded populace may not go over so easily.\nBitcoin (or hyper-efficient anonymous money in general, which Bitcoin may or may not actually be) solves the second problem, the third and perhaps even part of the first. Bitcoin is standardized around the world, so once an open-source Bitcoin-based toll solution is developed every city that wants to can simply plug it in. As for privacy, Bitcoin can be used to send transactions without linking them to any particular car; wallets can be specifically designed to avoid transaction linking. And as for infrastructure, Bitcoin is driving innovation with tools like Mycelium\u2019s Bitcoin Card, which should make all relevant infrastructure much cheaper. Additionally, because Bitcoin payments only really need an internet connection in order to work, municipalities can take advantage of the opportunity to set up Bitcoin road tolls and offer city-wide free wifi at the same time.\nThe revenue from such tolls could potentially be massive; collecting even two dollars from the average driver each day could easily pay for the public transit expansion that would absorb all of the residents that choose to no longer drive as a result of the tolls. And the drivers that do pay would enjoy cleaner, less congested roads; in fact, an economic argument can be made that the cost of paying the toll would simply replace, and not add to, the discomfort of driving in congested traffic \u2013 the only difference is, the cost would go towards schools and parks and libraries, and not engulfing your mind with blaring honks and frustration.\nElectricity, Water, Garbage Disposal\nAside from roads, there are plenty of other services that local and provincial governments often charge for; electricity, water, gas and garbage disposal are perhaps the top four. All of these services, in fact, face the general problem as roads: they can be charged for, and in this case they always are, but the process can be done much more efficiently and in a more privacy-preserving way. Consider electricity, for example. One of the major challenges of electricity generation is that, while output from power plants is usually constant, electricity is needed in different quantities at different times, and it is very difficult to store electricity in order to smooth out these variations. If your local power plants can generate a total of 2000 MW of power, and average consumption is 1200 MW, that might sound like a safe margin, but in real life things are not nearly so simple. What if people consume 400 MW between midnight and 16:00, but 2800 MW for the other eight hours? What if there are two peaktimes, one smaller one in the morning and a larger one in the evening? What if there\u2019s also a difference between weekdays and weekends? So far, the main workaround has been to simply build power plants to maximum capacity and often leave them unused.\nThe first solution to the problem is smart meters. Electricity distribution agencies (whether government departments, private companies or anything in between) could set different prices for electricity at different times \u2013 perhaps one might pay $0.04 per kWh at night, but $0.20 per kWh at peak time, and electricity meters that are aware of the prices could calculate the cost. In some places in the United States, the agencies occasionally announce \u201ccritical price events\u201d \u2013 blocks of time where, due to particularly high usage (eg. due to unexpected heat), the price of electricity would be ten times higher than usual. Residents living through these events are forced to cut down drastically on all non-essential usage during those hours to save money, creating an efficient, and arguably more palatable, alternative to brownouts and blackouts. The problem with smart meters, however, is privacy. The more precise the pricing system, and the more accurate smart meters get, the more the electricity distribution agency knows about your electricity consumption. This is no small matter; marijuana growers and Bitcoin miners have already been discovered simply by watchin electricity usage now that systems for gathering and analyzing data have become so well-developed, and as finer-grained surveillance capabilities emerge it will not just be a small set of \u201cunusual\u201d lifestyles that can be found out. Whoever sells you your electricity could tell when you are cooking dinner, when you are making tea (possibly even what brand of teapot), and when you are fast asleep, down to the precise minute.\nCryptography offers a solution. What if, instead of recording how much electricity you spend and when, you could simply provide a zero-knowledge proof that all of the electricity you received you paid for, without revealing any other knowledge to the agency? With the advent of technologies like Zerocoin, cryptographers have proven themselves to be a resourceful lot; devising a protocol ideally suited for this should not be a problem. As one example of how a cryptographic solution might work, consider the following protocol: every hour, your smart meter (which can be open-source) publishes a cryptographic \u201ccommitment\u201d (eg. a SHA256 hash) to one of a few trillion trillion Bitcoin addresses controlled by the agency, and, depending on how much energy you consume, at the end of the hour the meter would anonymously send money to that address. To enforce the system, we add an auditing protocol: after the commitment phase, the agency picks a random 0.1% of homes and monitors the electricity usage of everyone in that group itself. This need not be especially difficult; one solution is to require homeowners to have two smart meters, of which one is open source and does most of the day-to-day reporting and payment, and the other is proprietary. The open source meter can be trusted not to reveal any information outside of the protocol because the source code is auditable, and the proprietary meter can be trusted because computer experts could wiretap the device and see that it only sends a few bytes to the agency during the occasional auditing phase.\nOnce the hour is over and the payments are supposed to be sent, the agency requires those users (or rather, their smart meters) to provide the addresses that they paid to. The agency checks to see if the correct payment was sent to that address within the past hour, and if the address matches the cryptographic commitment. The commitment scheme ensures that homeowners cannot trick the system by simply looking for a government address that has the right balance paid to it in the past hour and claiming that was the one they had sent money to themselves; instead, homeowners must decide on the address before the fact. This isn\u2019t quite zero-knowledge, as you do lose your privacy during that 0.1% of hours that you get audited, and it requires another mathematical trick that wasn\u2019t described here to allow the agency to actually control trillions and trillions of addresses, but it illustrates the principle.\nWater and gas can be charged for in the same way; garbage disposal is a somewhat different problem, but even there Bitcoin can make serious headways in increasing efficiency by allowing garbage collectors to charge in fine increments by mass. The general principle remains the same; with cryptographic auditing techniques, it becomes possible to charge for anything at a much lower cost of data privacy than before. Businesses could benefit too; factories may wish to buy materials using this kind of cryptographic scheme so that they can meet their rapidly changing industrial needs without clueing competitors into what they are interested in. An interesting technology called private information retrieval allows users to pay for downloads from a database without revealing to anyone, including the database itself, what they were looking for. Privacy-preserving purchases have thousands of applications, and we\u2019ve only begun to scratch the surface of what they could offer.\nSales Tax\nAnonymous cash, combined with the commitment scheme protocol described in the previous section, could allow for a more efficient, and privacy-preserving, collection of sales tax as well. The way this would work is similar; stores would publish a commitment to a government address for every transaction, and occasionally auditors would, after a particular transaction, demand that the address corresponding to that transaction be revealed. Government gets all of the taxes, stores need to do zero reporting; essentially a win-win for both sides. Of course, the \u201cshadow economy\u201d, including anonymous commerce over the internet, would evade sales tax entirely, but this still shows how an increase in financial privacy can actually make tax collection more efficient.\nWhat these examples show is that crypto-anarchism is not the only political platform that can find financial privacy useful; efficient anonymous money may well allow governments, especially on the municipal level, much more freedom to fine-tune taxes and other monetary incentive mechanisms to meet communities\u2019 hour-by-hour needs. In those cities that are daring enough to try it out, this may well finally bring the futuristic technocratic utopias that we have all been waiting for. And, if are the sort of person that does not want governments to become any more powerful than they currently are, do not despair; the only municipalities that will actually be willing to implement any of these measures at first may well be private cities.", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 2}

The cease and desist order was a vague one, telling the foundation to \u201ccease and desist from the business of conducting money transmission in this state\u201d without specifying what the foundation was actually doing that qualified as money transmission. There was little to go on; the Bitcoin Foundation is simply an advocacy organization that \u201cstandardizes, protects and promotes the use of Bitcoin cryptographic money for the benefit of users worldwide.\u201d It may be possible that the state of California is thinking of a rule that \u201cwhoever knowingly conducts, controls, manages, supervises, directs, or owns all or part of an unlicensed money transmitting business\u201d is also guilty of unlicensed money transmission, and they consider the Bitcoin Foundation to be somehow directing the activities of Coinlab, BitInstant and their other major business members, but there is no evidence that the state was actually following that path.\nThe reply that the Foundation wrote back was a strong one, attacking the claim that it was engaged in unlicensed money transmission in California in three ways. The first two parts of the argument are exactly what we would expect. Starting from where the main part of the rebuttal begins, the reply reads, \u201cthe California Money Transmission Act regulates only \u2018the business of money transmission \u2026 in this state\u2019 \u2013 namely, California. The Bitcoin Foundation does not have business operations in California that would subject it to the DFI\u2019s jurisdiction. The Foundation is incorporated in Washington D.C., and operates out of offices in Seattle, Washington.\u201d Since the foundation does not actually perform any potentially regulated activities in California, it cannot be regulated by California. Second, \u201cthe Bitcoin Foundation is not in the business of selling bitcoin to consumers and does not otherwise operate a bitcoin exchange\u201d \u2013 its main Bitcoin-related activity is simply accepting donations in BTC, which would be very difficult to frame as an act of \u201cmoney transmission\u201d.\nEven the first technicality alone would have arguably been strong enough to refute the DFI\u2019s claims, but the foundation did not stop there. The third, and most interesting, part of the letter argues that, even if the Bitcoin Foundation did actively sell bitcoins to customers, that activity itself is not a form of money transmission. The reply begins by quoting the California definition of money transmission:\nCalifornia defines money transmission as including any of the following:\u201cselling or issuing payment instruments;\u201d\u201cselling or issuing stored value;\u201d and\u201creceiving money for transmission.\u201d\nFrom there, the reply examines each of these three sections and describes how selling bitcoins actually does not fall under any of them. The summarized arguments are as follows:\nIn California, a payment instrument is \u201ca check, draft, money order, traveler\u2019s check or other instrument for the transmission or payment of money or monetary value, whether or not negotiable\u201d \u2026 In July 2001, the California Department of Financial Institutions released a letter on the \u201csale of ATM-accessible cards clarifying that \u201can \u2018instrument\u2019 is a written, signed document that it is similar in nature to a check or a draft, even though not negotiable. We have,therefore, not viewed electronic media, such as stored value cards, as payment instruments\u201d \u2026 Bitcoins are not written or signed notes or drafts, and therefore, are not payment instruments regulated by the California Money Transmitter Act. Even if bitcoins are classified as \u201cinstruments,\u201d there exists no \u201cissuer\u201d of bitcoins under California law because no entity acts as the \u201cmaker or drawer\u201d of bitcoins, and no entity is fundamentally liable for payment.\nStored value is \u201cmonetary value representing a claim against the issuer that is stored on an electronic or digital medium and evidenced by an electronic or digital record, and that is intended and accepted for use as a means of redemption for money or monetary value or payment for goods and services\u201d \u2026 Bitcoin might be described as a \u201cmedium of exchange, whether or not redeemable in money,\u201d and therefore be considered monetary value, but that monetary value is not fixed \u2013 it varies with the determinations of the market. Furthermore, bitcoin never represents a claim against an issuer, because there is no issuer of bitcoin. Bitcoin is therefore not stored value as that term is defined under California law.\nCalifornia law defines money transmission as \u201creceiving money or monetary value\u2026for transmission.\u201d The plain language of this provision indicates that money transmission occurs when money is received and transmitted or when monetary value is received and transmitted. In other words, the statute, on its face, requires parity of currency on either side of the transaction -money received and transmitted or monetary value received and transmitted. This conclusion is confirmed by the DFI\u2019s December 6, 2011 opinion letter entitled \u201cForeign Currency Exchange Services \u2013 Not Subject to money Transmission Act.\u201d In that opinion, the DFI determined that the receipt of dollars and the delivery of pesos for a fee did not constitute money transmission.\nSimply put, this is huge. The foundation has taken the DFI\u2019s claim that it is engaging in money transmission and transformed it into an opportunity to argue that selling bitcoins is an entirely unregulated activity in the state of California. The letter finishes off by actually requesting a reply from the DFI confirming the validity of their arguments. The other half of operating a true Bitcoin exchange, buying bitcoins (ie. selling USD and taking BTC as payment), was not addressed by the letter; a layman\u2019s reading of the above definition of money transmission suggests that bank transfer withdrawals may be covered under stored value but selling cash in the mail (or cash from a two-way Bitcoin ATM) is free and clear. Even if only selling BTC is legal, however, buying bitcoins is the far more pressing side of the Bitcoin exchange equation; \u201cselling\u201d BTC is already relatively easy with platforms like Gyft and the various Bitcoin-accepting stores. If the foundation proves to be successful, California may well become one of the more Bitcoin-friendly states in the country \u2013 although hopefully others will follow suit.", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 4}

The price tumbled frm $128.8 to $97.5 (and currently stands around $70), major Bitcoin network statistics like the number of transactions per block and the number of unique Bitcoin addresses used took a nosedive, and the Bitcoin Foundation received a cease and desist letter from the state of California\u2019s Department of Financial Institutions. On the other hand, Google Trends volume, a statistic which estimates the global level of interest in Bitcoin, at least temporarily stopped its decline, and is now back at May 19-25 levels, or 20% of the peak. Media attention was mixed, with some articles arguing that Bitcoin \u201cis losing its shine\u201d and others saying that it is now \u201cgetting its groove back\u201d following a few instances of good news.\nAs far as the price and popularity are concerned, it is my own thesis that we have now returned to a pattern that old-time Bitcoiners know all too well: the Gartner Hype Cycle. The Gartner Hype Cycle is a pattern that many technologies, ranging from machine learning to space exploration and virtual reality, consistently tend to face, and has five stages: (1) a \u201ctechnology trigger\u201d, (2) a \u201cpeak of inflated expectations\u201d, (3) a \u201ctrough of disillusionment\u201d, (4) a \u201cslope of enlightenment\u201d and finally (5) a \u201cplateau of productivity\u201d. Bitcoin users in 2011 and 2012 would frequently refer to this model, saying that the currency\u2019s crash from $30 was simply the result of a hype bubble popping and a sign that the \u201creal work\u201d was only starting to come to fruition. In late 2012 to early 2013, many believed that the plateau of productivity was finally here. As it turns out, that was not the case \u2013 in fact, 2013 proved to be the start of a whole new hype cycle. However, this time is different. Although some anti-Bitcoin viewpoints have certainly come to the forefront, by and large today, unlike in 2011, the hopeless pessimism is simply not there. Investors have plunged into Bitcoin, and have committed themselves to working for the long haul. Hardened users have seen the Bitcoin price crash before, and are ready to live through a crash for a second time \u2013 that is, of course, if the crash is not already close to its bottom.\nTaxes and Regulations\nThe World Bank held a panel on \u201cthe legal and regulatory challenges\u201d of digital currencies. The agenda was made up of four main parts: an overview of virtual currencies, implications for payment systems overseers, two panels on illicit activities and recent regulatory actions by the US Treasury.MtGox published an ad in the official magazine of the annual G8 summit, which took place in Ireland this year.The Dutch and Australian governments confirmed that Bitcoin earnings will be taxable. \u201cBitcoin is no more anonymous than physical cash and the ATO has experience in working with earlier forms of \u00adanonymous electronic money systems, and with physical cash, which are relevant for responding to new and emerging\u00adsystems,\u201d the Australian Taxation Office senior assistant commissioner wrote.The German government took a different tack: if the time between when one buys bitcoins and sells them is longer than a year, any capital gains income from the investment is tax-free.The Government Accountability Office in the United States published a report detailing when digital currency systems are taxable and when they are not, and stated that the IRS was not interested in creating Bitcoin-specific rules.California\u2019s Department of Financial Institutions sent a cease-and-desist letter to the Bitcoin Foundation telling them to stop engaging in money transmission activities. The Bitcoin Foundation has since replied, arguing that it was not selling bitcoins, and even if it was selling bitcoins does not constitute money transmission in California.MtGox appears to be well on its way to resolving its conflict with the Department of Homeland Security, having recently created a new Delaware corporation in the United States and applying for a FinCEN money services business license.\nOne Exchange Down, Three Pop Back Up\nLibertyBit, the second largest Canadian exchange, has shut down its operations and has refunded customers\u2019 money, citing banking concerns and fraudulent transactions.Satoshi Square, a weekly in-person Bitcoin exchange event in New York, expanded is operations to Los Angeles.Bitcoin Exchange Berlin, another in-person Bitcoin exchange event in Berlin, had its first session on June 29.BTCGlobal, a company seeking to massively reduce the barriers to entry to creating a Bitcoin exchange in the US, announced itself to the public.

BIPS was responsible for getting single.dk, a popular Danish online dating site, to accept Bitcoin, as well as several brick-and-mortar locations including a theater in Denmark and CoWorkingSpace in Toronto. Given this success, Harding and Henriksen have decided to work on BIPS full force.\nThe two are careful to avoid telling users that they are expected to switch to BIPS; \u201cI prefer people to make their own choices,\u201d Henriksen writes; \u201cso many times I have experienced companies changing structure and people being highly disappointed with the new.\u201d The two main alternatives that WalletBit users have to choose from are BIPS and BitPay, which also allows bank account payouts in European countries. In the United States, another alternative is Coinbase, and those who wish to accept bitcoins directly without converting earnings to fiat currency can use Coinbase anywhere in the world. The payment processor ecosystem is expected to only continue to improve as time goes on.", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 4}

The underlying issue is this: in order to add a new block to the Bitcoin blockchain, a Bitcoin miner must include a \u201cproof of work\u201d, a number which has a property that is hard to find numbers that satisfy, but is efficient to verify. Essentially, a proof of work is a way of proving to the world that the miner spent a certain amount of computational effort generating the block, and is in fact a vital component of Bitcoin\u2019s security \u2013 without proof of work, an attacker could easily pretend to be a million Bitcoin nodes at the same time, and in that way seriously compromise Bitcoin\u2019s transaction ordering mechanisms. The canonical attack, the so-called \u201cdouble spending\u201d fraud, involves sending a payment to a merchant, later sending the same coins back to yourself and then creating a false consensus that the second transaction happened first, thereby depriving the merchant of their money. Proof of work solves the problem by making \u201cpretending to be a million Bitcoin nodes\u201d prohibitively expensive. However, what makes people uncomfortable is that in Bitcoin\u2019s case the work (SHA256 computations) has no underlying value; rather, Bitcoin\u2019s proof of work is literally nothing more than burning electricity for its own sake.\nIt has always been thought that we could do better. Many newbies to Bitcoin immediately suggest that the mining algorithm should have involved SETI@home or folding@home, so that the computations would also help bring humanity closer to curing protein misfolding diseases or finding aliens. The problem is, however, that Bitcoin mining requires one key property that SHA256 does have but SETI@home and folding@home do not: it is efficiently verifiable. Right now, all participants in the SETI and folding networks are volunteers, meaning that they (probably) have no intentions other than the desire to actually help the project\u2019s underlying goal. If these networks become tied to Bitcoin mining, however, participants will be motivated by profit, so there would be an overwhelming incentive for miners not to bother with the actual computations and instead provide fake data that has no value to the networks\u2019 underlying goals but is indistinguishable from a genuine computational output.\nPrimecoin is the first proof-of-work based cryptocurrency that has come up with any kind of workable solution. The central premise of Primecoin is that, instead of useless SHA256 hashes, the proof of work protocol would require miners to find long chains of prime numbers. There are three specific types of chains that are of interest: Cunningham chains of the first kind, Cunningham chains of the second kind, and \u201cbi-twin\u201d chains. The rule behind a Cunningham chain of the first kind is that each prime in the chain must be one less than twice the previous. The first Cunningham chain of length 5, for example, consists of the following six primes:\n1531, 3061, 6121, 12241, 24481\nIn Cunningham chains of the second kind, each prime must be one more than twice the previous. Here, the first length-5 chain appears much sooner:\n2, 5, 11, 23, 47\nFinally, bi-twin chains are chains of pairs of twin primes, or primes that are 2 units apart from each other, with the average of each pair being twice the average of the previous pair. Each bi-twin chain must obviously have even length; the first chain six primes long is:\n211049, 211051, 422099, 422101, 844199, 844201\nNote that a bi-twin chain is essentially a Cunningham chain of the first kind and a Cunningham chain of the second kind rolled into one; the first numbers of each pair follow the recurrence that each one is one more than twice the previous (211049 * 2 + 1 = 422099, etc), and the second numbers of each pair are similarly one less than twice the previous.\nWhat is the practical utility of finding primes? Well, if the effort that we put into the topic today for its own sake is any indication, there is definitely at least something to it. The Electronic Frontier Foundation is offering $550,000 worth of prizes to the first groups to discover a prime number more than 1 million, 10 million, 100 million and 1 billion digits long. The first two awards have already been claimed. The Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search has been looking for large prime numbers since 1996, and mathematicians in universities around the world are involved. The University of Tennessee at Martin provides a list of reasons why looking for primes is useful; aside from \u201cfor the glory!\u201d, searching for primes leads to useful byproducts in other areas of number theory, provides an incentive for computational hardware development and leads to insights in the underlying workings of prime numbers themselves; the prime number theorem, for example, a theorem stating with high precision how often prime numbers are likely to occur at a given size, was first conjectured by looking at the distribution of actual prime numbers. Here, the hope is that if Primecoin takes off people will start looking for much more efficient ways of finding Cunningham and bi-twin chains, potentially leading to mathematical breakthroughs in how these chains work.\nFurther Refinements\nIn order to be a viable cryptocurrency, Primecoin needs a way to finely tune the difficulty of the proof of work; otherwise, new developments in technology or increased popularity may lead to new blocks being created too quickly for the blockchain to be stable or so slowly that transactions take hours to confirm. By themselves, prime chains do not provide enough granularity; a chain eight primes long may be a hundred times harder to find than a chain seven primes long. One option is to reward length, but that would make verification more difficult. The solution that Primecoin settled for is one based on the Fermat test. The Fermat test is a quick way of telling if a number is (very probably) a prime: raise any number (typically 2) to the power of a prime, subtract out the prime as many times as possible and see if you get the original number back. For example:\n217\u2013 17 * 7710 = 2 223\u2013 23 * 364722 = 2\nBut:\n221\u2013 21 * 99864 = 8\nAn alternative, and slightly better, formulation is to raise the number to the power of the prime minus one and see if you get one; this being true clearly implies the number passing the other test, and the other direction holds most of the time (one exception is that 3560= 375 but 3561= 3 (561 is not prime), but these become extremely rare as primes get bigger). Primecoin uses the p-1 test in combination with the Euler-Lagrange-Lifchitz test, which uses similar principles, to establish primality. So, the question is, how can one use this test to create granularity? That is, how can one distinguish between a chain 7.2 primes long and a chain 7.5 primes long? The answer is simple: look at the resulting value of the Fermat test of the first value in the chain not to be a prime; the lower it is, the larger the \u201cfractional length\u201d. For example, our chain of 2, 5, 11, 23, 47 has the next value 95, 294modulo 95 (modulo being the mathematical term for the process of repeated subtraction used above) is 54, so the chain would have a length of 5 + (95 \u2013 54) / 95 ~= 5.43. However, the chain 1531\u202624481 has the next value 48961 with a relatively low Fermat remainder of 1024, so the length would be 5 + (48961 \u2013 1024) / 48961 ~= 5.97. In order for a prime chain to count as a valid proof of work, it must have a fractional length at least equal to the difficulty; as of the time of this writing, this parameter is floating around 7.1.\nSince we do not want proofs of work to be reusable, Primecoin also adds another restriction. For the purposes of Primecoin, the \u201corigin\u201d of a bi-twin chain is defined as the average of the first pair, and for single Cunningham chains the origin is what the average of the first pair would be if the Cunningham chain\u2019s twin also existed; for example, the origins of the two single Cunningham chains given above are 1530 and 3, respectively. The restriction is that the origin of a prime chain must be divisible by the hash of the block that the proof of work is for. Hash functions have the property that the only way to look for a value that has a particular hash is the computationally infeasible strategy of simply trying new values until you get a result that works; thus, the only way to generate valid proofs of work is to look for prime chains targeted to one block of which you already know the hash, and these chains would only ever be useful for that specific block.\nPrimecoin also adds a number of other innovations on the side:\nSmooth difficulty adjustment \u2013 unlike Bitcoin, which adjusts its difficulty to exactly match the target rate of 1 block per 10 minutes every 2016 blocks (roughly two weeks), Primecoin adjusts its difficulty slightly every block, nudging it toward the target rate in an exponential decay pattern. For example, if network hash power (or rather, prime generation power) suddenly doubles, the next block would be 0.02% harder than the previous, increasing the amount of work required per block to 186.5% of the original after one week and 198.2% after two weeks, assuming no further mining power increases take place.Very fast confirmations \u2013 unlike Bitcoin, where transactions take an average of ten minutes to confirm (eight minutes in practice since the difficulty must constantly catch up to increasing mining power), Primecoin blocks come at a rate of one per minute. This allows secure transactions to be made much more quickly; six confirmations may take fifty minutes in Bitcoin, but they take only six minutes in Primecoin. The underlying mathematics behind why six confirmations is a fairly safe threshold is independent of block confirmation time, so the Primecoin transaction at six confitmations is no less secure (it can be argued that attackers can make double-spending attempts ten times more frequently, but going up to just seven or eight confirmations more than makes up for this).Self-adjusting block reward \u2013 Bitcoin is known for its controlled currency supply algorithm, which guarantees that only 21 million bitcoins will ever be generated, as well as specifying the rate at which these bitcoins will come out. Primecoin follows a different path. The number of primecoins (XPM) released per block is always equal to 999 divided by the square of the difficulty, a formula which should converge to some maximum if the difficulty increases linearly. Given that Moore\u2019s Law states that computing power increases exponentially, and the effort it takes to find a prime chain is exponential in its length, that is quite likely to hold true.\nThere are some places where Primecoin missed some serious opportunities for improvement. First of all, the self-adjusting block reward was intended to be a \u201cmore natural simulation of gold\u2019s scarcity\u201d. However, in practice it does the exact opposite. The desirable property that gold has is that its supply at least somewhat increases with its value; if the gold price shoots past $5,000, mining opportunities will become profitable that were not profitable before, increasing the rate at which new gold is mined and eventually making the supply go up, partially counteracting the price shock. Here, if the price goes up by a factor of ten, the difficulty will shoot up significantly as well as more miners move in, leading to\u2026 a reduction in the Primecoin generation rate. Thus, instead of adding the negative feedback mechanism inherent in gold, Primecoin instead creates a positive feedback mechanism that exacerbates the problem of volatility. Also, Primecoin could have set up its exponential adjustment algorithm to have a much longer period \u2013 reaching 86.5% adjustment after two months, for example, instead of a week. This is one innovation that would also at least somewhat stabilize the value of the currency by generating more coins when interest goes up, but unfortunately so far no currency has tried this; Primecoin, despite all of its other improvements, missed the chance to be the first.\nAll in all, Primecoin presents itself as an extremely interesting experiment; for the first time, we have a currency whose mining algorithm has a secondary value, and at the same time Primecoin, unlike so many other coins before it, actually makes serious attempts to improve on Bitcoin in unrelated aspects. Not taking into account Bitcoin\u2019s massive headstart, Primecoin may well be the first alternative coin to actually be better than Bitcoin, giving the currency the potential for a bright future ahead.\nRead the exclusive interview with Primecoin\u2019s creator Sunny King in the issue 13 of Bitcoin Magazine.", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 8}

Coinpunk is a project led by veteran startup founder Kyle Drake to build an open source web-based wallet service that can be run by any user, by developers to build their own wallet service, or organizations wanting to run their own Bitcoin \u201ccredit unions\u201d.\nThe announcement is part of the Foundation\u2019s Q2 Grant Award, which is an ongoing effort to improve the open source ecosystem of Bitcoin by providing funding to help improve the tools available for people to work with Bitcoin. The first grants were for Q1, which included important funding for improvements to Bitcoin testing infrastructure.\n\u201cThe main tenet of Bitcoin is that decentralization is what drives its soundness\u201d, said Kyle. \u201cBut what we\u2019ve seen recently is an ecosystem where web wallets are run by a few US/UK based players. That\u2019s similar to the way GMail works for email, which isn\u2019t a bad thing, but it\u2019s not for everyone. If Bitcoin wants to maintain its goal of being decentralized, there needs to be a rich abundance of choices, and web wallet services need to be available to different organizations and countries.\u201d Kyle added that it is the implications on banking that interests him the most. \u201cInstead of having big banks and financial groups control your money, you get Bitcoin owners being their own banks, investing in only the things they want to invest in, and not being charged with mystery fees or being exposed to fraud and malinvestment of funds.\u201d\nKyle noted there is currently a version of Coinpunk available, but that he\u2019s currently in the process of building a major new version. \u201cI\u2019m providing the option to move the security from the server to the browser side, which makes the server less like a bank that holds your money, and more like a safety deposit box it can\u2019t open, which increases trustability. I\u2019m also focusing on building the tools developers need to make custom wallet services for solving specific problems or running exchanges in non-US countries with this technology.\u201d\nKyle isn\u2019t sure when the project will be finished, noting that he wants the project to be stable before releasing the new version, but hopes to have a release available by the end of late summer. \u201cIt\u2019s a very ambitious project that\u2019s going to affect a lot of people, and I want to make sure we get things right. We want to provide a rich set of options and developer tools, so we can enable a web wallet ecosystem for working with Bitcoin that hopefully becomes a strong community resource.\u201d\nThe next grant deadline for Q3 proposals will be Friday, September 20th. Information on submitting grant proposals can be found on the Bitcoin Foundation blog.\nBitcoin Magazine had the privilege of interview Coinpunk veteran startup founder Kyle Drake.\n\nBitcoin Magazine : When did you first hear about and get involved in the Bitcoin currency?\nKyle Drake:I first heard about Bitcoin a few years ago, and it immediately made sense to me what it was trying to do, and I\u2019ve been following it pretty closely ever since. I\u2019ve always been fascinated by economics, and have spent a lot of time reading about the effects of commodity money, especially in edge cases (like how cigarettes are used in prisons as a currency, and sea shells were used in antiquity). These edge cases emphasize a natural way that humans tend to deal with resource problems in a microcosmic, decentralized way. Having that background allowed me to quickly realize that Bitcoin was going to be the replacement and improvement for a lot of centralized financial systems, and that got me interested.\nThe current Bitcoin climate reminds me a lot of the Homebrew Computer Club days in the 70s, when there were passionate idealists working on side projects that ended up creating the most culturally liberating technology in the world: the personal computer. And I see Bitcoin as a logical extension of that pioneering work: Banks are today\u2019s mainframes, and Bitcoin is the financial version of the personal computer. Centralized, versus decentralized. Being a bank stops being this expensive thing only a few large corporations can do \u2013 it becomes something everybody can do.\nNot everybody \u201cgets\u201d Bitcoin yet, just like people didn\u2019t \u201cgot\u201d personal computers back then, when it was mainly the purview of hackers like Steve Wozniak and idealistic visionaries like Stewart Brand. But I am seeing the potential of Bitcoin for the exact same reasons they had for the personal computer, and in time I think the profound nature of Bitcoin will be obvious to everyone. I think we\u2019re on the ground floor of something very important here, and I want to help contribute to that.\nIn the United States, the mortgage crisis and the Occupy movement really brought the problems with our banking system to the forefront, and you had people finally starting to look at their banks, that were creating random fines and fees, investing poorly, kicking people out of their homes without giving them a fair chance, and say \u201cI don\u2019t agree with what you\u2019re doing\u201d. I see the opportunity for Bitcoin to help build a more ethical banking system, that gives customers more choice and control over their money, that isn\u2019t filled with arbitrary fees and restrictions, and that deals with the massive fraud problem that our banking system has completely failed to address with credit cards and wire transfers.\nBM: When did you first get the idea for Coinpunk and what inspired you to create the site?\nKD: I\u2019ve always been interested in the wallet side of the problem, because I see wallets as the natural evolution of a bank account.\nI wanted to run my own Bitcoin wallet service, so I looked around for open source solutions and couldn\u2019t find one. This was concerning, because I believed if there wasn\u2019t a good open source option, it might lead to situation where all the wallets become centrally controlled by a few entities, which could bring us right back to many of the problems with our current banking system.\nI\u2019m not against commercial wallet services, I think they are good (and play a role similar to that of Google Mail for email). But we need open source alternatives, too, so that we improve upon Bitcoin\u2019s biggest strength: decentralization. If email only worked through Google Mail and Hotmail, it wouldn\u2019t be very good.\nBM: Were there any preexisting businesses that inspired you to create Coinpunk?\nKD: All of the current wallet services have been an inspiration of sorts, because I was able to see how they approached the problem, and distill that into something that I thought would work well for this project. There\u2019s really nothing wrong with the existing wallet services, most of them are great. They\u2019re just not fully open source, and are based in specific countries.\nI wanted to make a project for people wanting to run and build their own wallet service, in the same light as projects like buttercoin (an open source Bitcoin exchange platform). I don\u2019t see Coinpunk as competing with commercial wallet services. In fact, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they find parts of the project useful for their work. Everybody\u2019s helping each other out, and that\u2019s a very positive thing for the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nBM: Where do you see Coinpunk going in a year?\nKD: Coinpunk is going to be a fully-featured wallet service, and I hope to see people start to use it to solve real-world problems.\nI\u2019m expecting to see a lot of usage in interesting ways, such as with hardware wallets like BitSafe (which Butterfly Labs is currently working on). I\u2019m also very interested in seeing Coinpunk used in regional exchange and wallet services that help Bitcoin adoption in countries with bad currency problems (like Argentina). Bitcoin could really be a lifeboat for people in countries with high inflation rates like Argentina and Venezuela, and I hope Coinpunk gets to play a role there.\nBM: What makes your new wallet stand out in comparison to other wallets for the Bitcoin currency?\nKD: Coinpunk is the only fully open-source web wallet service available. That\u2019s its main differentiation right now, but I expect that it will stand out in other ways in the future as we start adding more functionality.\nBM: What are your suggestions for individuals hoping to start an open source project like yours?\nKD: Just do it! The Bitcoin development community is very friendly, open and collaborative. There is a lot of support for people working on improving the ecosystem and protecting our legal rights with groups like the Bitcoin Foundation, and there\u2019s a lot of important and interesting problems that need to be solved. This isn\u2019t another stupid photo sharing app: We know we\u2019re changing the world, and everybody is excited about it. It\u2019s a lot of fun.\nBM: If I am a merchant looking to sell through your site, how can I get started?\nKD: Coinpunk might support some basic bitcoin-to-bitcoin purchase services in the future, and will have an API to help facilitate development, but I would strongly recommend using a merchant-specific service like BitPay for now. They have been spending a lot of time working on making it easy for people, are way more affordable (and less fraud prone) than credit cards, and can do conversions to your local currency for you automatically.", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 9}

What makes your legal services stand out in comparison to other lawyers assisting individuals in the Bitcoin community?\nMS: I have always been a technology enthusiast. I think it has mapped well onto my practice counseling businesses in the tech sector. I don\u2019t actually remember when I purchased my first Bitcoin, but I\u2019ve since fallen pretty deeply into the crypto-currency rabbit hole. I\u2019m fairly certain I\u2019ve read every bit of press coverage on digital currency published since then. I attend regular Bitcoin NYC Meetup groups dedicated specifically to Bitcoin entrepreneurship. I\u2019ve engaged in in-depth statutory analysis, regulatory projections, and simple speculation on web forums. The firm\u2019s clients get the benefit of that knowledge without having to pay someone to reinvent the wheel. I think that clients appreciate it when they don\u2019t have to spend their first chunk of billable time explaining to their lawyer what the block chain is, and why an M-of-N transaction might be the solution to their regulatory concerns. That\u2019s the kind of information the lawyer ought to be providing to the client, not the other way around.\nBM: When did you first get the idea to work with clients involved in Bitcoin?\nMS: As it goes with most things in the practice of law, I didn\u2019t choose Bitcoin; Bitcoin chose me. Companies first began reaching out to me with their digital currency issues in response to my work with businesses in the tech sector. As that progressed, I was named Chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s Regulatory Affairs Committee. Word of mouth is a powerful thing, and I think clients prefer to use attorneys with an intimate knowledge of their industry.\nBM: How did you make the decision to accept payment from clients in Bitcoin?\nMS: The firm strives to serve its clients. That means flexibility with time \u2013 picking up the phone at midnight \u2013 and flexibility with money \u2013 accepting alternative currencies. It should come as no surprise that clients whose business is dealing in digital currency might prefer to pay their legal fees in digital currency. Paying in Bitcoin presents qualified clients with the flexibility and confidence to meet their cash flow and tax planning goals.\nBM: Were there any preexisting law firms and/or businesses that inspired you to get involved in the Bitcoin currency?\nMS: The inspiration to get involved with Bitcoin came, as many things in this industry come, from our clients. Bitcoin adoption is the fundamental driving force of their business models. Combine this with the fact that many clients in the space already possess substantial Bitcoin holdings, and it just makes good business sense for them to pay in Bitcoin.\nBM: Where do you see your Law Firm\u2019s involvement with Bitcoin going in a year?\nMS: Digital currency law is the copyright law of the 2010s. As most lawyers recall, the revolution in computer applications and mp3 encoding resulted in an unprecedented explosion in the volume and quality of copyright law in the late 1990s and 2000s. Likewise, I anticipate substantial growth in the volume and quality of digital currency law in the coming years. Nesenoff & Miltenberg is committed to positioning itself as the law firm of choice for guidance in the digital currency space.\nBM: What are your suggestions for individuals hoping to get involved with Bitcoin?\nMS: As to early-stage businesses: Talk to a lawyer early on, and then run the numbers. Then run them again. Then run them again, and only then sink money and time into developing your product. That is the correct order of operation for the digital currency business. I spend hours a day speaking to entrepreneurs who have already developed a spectacularly functional and well-polished product, only to realize the cost of IP licensing and regulatory compliance means reworking key features of their business model. As to individuals: support Bitcoin businesses!\nBM: If I am an individual involved in the Bitcoin community and need legal assistance, how can I get in touch with your law firm?\nMS: You can visit our website atwww.nmllplaw.com, and you can email me at [email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=\"currentScript\"in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\"),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\"cf-hash\"))return t[e]}();if(t&&t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(\"data-cfemail\");if(a){for(e=\"\",r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]> */for more information.\nBitcoin Magazine applauds N&M\u2019s work in the Bitcoin community and additionally this next step to accept payment for legal services with the Bitcoin currency.

Thanks to Aqoba, Bitcoin Central users would have the fiat portion of their funds stored in an actual, federally insured, bank account, which they could send money to via traditional mechanisms like wire transfer. Unfortunately, the agreement never came to fruition. Weeks and then months passed without any further progress in the implementation, and by April Bitcoin Central was forced to shut down for unrelated reasons involving security. The exchange now plans to start again with another payment processor when they come back online.\nNow, the leading Bitcoin exchange in Germany has just announced that it is doing a very similar thing. Bitcoin.de, a Bitcoin exchange that has been bringing together Bitcoin buyers and sellers since August 2011, has announced a partnership with Fidor Bank through which the exchange will integrate with the bank directly. Understanding exactly what this integration is first requires a knowledge of how Bitcoin.de works. Bitcoin.de is not a typical exchange; rather, it is a hybrid between a typical exchange and localbitcoins.com. The exchange maintains an order book, charts, an internal Bitcoin wallet and many of the other trappings of a typical exchange, but trades happen between buyers and sellers directly. As the original post (German) explains:\nOn our portal users can easily sell bitcoins to other users or buy from them. To do that users must register at bitcoin.de and, insofar as they want to be sellers, transfer a quantity of bitcoins to their bitcoin.de account. Once a buyer is found for their bitcoins, the payment information is automatically sent to the buyer. The payment takes place directly between buyer and seller. As soon as the payment has arrived at the seller, the bitcoins are transferred for a small fee from the seller\u2019s account to the buyer\u2019s.\nBuyers and sellers have some latitude in choosing their payment option, and, as it turns out, Fidor Bank is a popular option. The problem was, however, that the process of making a full transaction, from the buyer receiving the seller\u2019s banking info to making the payment and finally the seller confirming that they received it, would take as long as 1-3 days to complete. Now, Bitcoin.de chief Oliver Flask\u00e4mpfer writes, \u201cthrough the cooperation with Fidor Bank over the next few weeks our customers will gain the possibility of trading bitcoins almost in real time on a free FidorPay checking account.\u201d Anyone with a legal residency in the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland will be able to get one of these accounts, and they would then be able to either use that same account as their bank account or send money to it by bank transfer much like one would deposit to BitStamp. Compared to BitStamp accounts, however, bitcoin.de will have one huge advantage. \u201cWhile customers of foreign Bitcoin exchanges must transfer their money abroad into non-insolvency-protected company accounts,\u201d Flask\u00e4mpfer continues, Bitcoin.de customers\u2019 money will be stored in their own bank accounts with EU deposit insurance of 100,000 EUR per customer per account.\u201d\nThis is significant in multiple ways. First of all, it essentially elevates bitcoin.de to the status of a fully-fledged Bitcoin exchange. Anyone in the EU wishing to exchange bitcoins can wire money to their FidorPay checking account, and then use that balance to buy and sell bitcoins at will on bitcoin.de \u2013 just like a BitStamp account (or MtGox account or BTC-E account). Second, this is an EU-wide, and possibly worldwide, first as a formal cooperation agreement with a bank, and not a lesser classification like a \u201cpayment services provider\u201d. Finally, this agreement appears to be considerably more likely to actually come to fruition. According to heise.de, \u201cthe cooperation should start once the banking regulator BaFIN gives its approval\u201d. Technically, approval is not even necessary, but after recent regulatory clashes in the US Flask\u00e4mpfer prefers to give BaFIN the opportunity to look through the agreement first just in case.\nAltogether, this is a strong step in boosting what has already become a powerful German Bitcoin community, and hopefully the agreement will go through as planned. \u201cIn the future,\u201d heise.de reports, \u201cBitcoin.de also wants to offer their own Bitpay-style payment service, which should allow merchants to receive business transactions with Bitcoin. For that a BaFIN license is necessary, It would take until 2014 to satisfy all the requirements, Flask\u00e4mpfer said. An exchange with an automatic trading system would then be the next step.\u201d", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 11}

The quantity and variety of businesses accepting payment in Bitcoin continues to expand. From real estate sites to now watch factories, Bitcoin has been embraced to simplify payment and incentivize merchants to sell products and in turn deal with fewer transaction fees.\nJust this week, Russia\u2019s historical watch factory Raketa, began accepting Bitcoins. Raketa was founded in 1721 by Peter the Great and is the oldest factory in Russia. For almost 300 years, Raketa, formerly known as Petrodvorets Watch Factory, has produced and sold wristwatches to individuals in Russian and those around the world. Petrodvorets Watch Factory was renamed Raketa in 1961 to honor the World\u2019s first cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. Yuri was the first human to travel to outer space.\nThis is a significant step in the right direction for the Bitcoin community. Over the years Raketa\u2019s watches have been produced for the members of the Red Army, Soviet Navy, North Pole expeditions and civilians. Not only is Raketa respected by Russian leadership, but also popular with the public having an array of watch designs from practical to fashionable. Raketa even has the last remaining watchmaking school and operates this training program in conjunction with the Saint Petersberg Technical Institute. Raketa is just not another watch brand or shop, but has deep roots within Russia and a global reach. We can expect Raketa\u2019s step to embrace the Bitcoin currency as a catalyst for other businesses in Russian and around the world to transact in Bitcoin.\nRaketa produces all mechanical movements in-house, setting this watch factory apart. Raketa is now unique in an even more significant way in that it currently stands as the only watch factory to date accepting Bitcoins for payment. Factory Director, Jacques von Polier stated, \u201cIt is very easy to accept Bitcoins\u2026you just put a logo on your site saying- we accept bitcoins- and that\u2019s it. It is as simple as saying we accept cash!\u201d Manufacturers and merchants can heed Von Polier\u2019s example of taking an easy step and in the long run a very beneficial step of accepting Bitcoins.Bitcoin Magazine encourages businesses to follow suite and accept this alternative payment method which not only alleviates merchant woes, but also makes payment much more convenient for customers.

Less than a day after founder Sunny King released the genesis block and I first covered the currency, Primecoin has become one of the few alternative cryptocurrencies to be featured on Business Insider, its thread on Bitcointalk has reached 77 pages and has attracted the interest of thousands of people around the world. Now, after two days in the wild, Primecoin is already bringing us real-world value.\nBuying primecoins has already become easy; Coins-e, a cryptocoin exchange featuring over 30 currencies, added Primecoin support yesterday. Users need only create an account, deposit bitcoins, and within one hour they will be able to exchange them for primecoins at a current rate of 1 for 0.005 BTC. And if you want to spend them, there\u2019s a business that accepts those too: Satoshi Roulette. SatoshiRoulette is a Bitcoin gambling site that popped up a few months after the industry was first popularized by Erik Voorhees\u2019 SatoshiDice, featuring a roulette game that you can play simply by going to the site, clicking on the guess you want to make (either a number, like 15 or 23, or special options like \u201cFIRST 12\u2033, \u201cEVEN\u201d or \u201c3rd line\u201d) and sending money to the Bitcoin address. As far as infrastructure is concerned, there is now a Primecoin block explorer, which can theoretically be used by web developers to easily set up a Primecoin-accepting store.\nHowever, that is not even the most interesting aspect of Primecoin\u2019s development. Rather, what deserves the most mention of all is that Primecoin miners have already broken world records for finding Cunningham chains. The specific record is for Cunningham chains of length 9; the longest three chains before this week had origins 111, 109 and 94 digits respectively, and had been discovered in 2004 and 2009. The two new records generated this week are 131 and 158 digits respectively. The numbers:\n\n15746436948707162347681191092622506406480521554672382866529 11336545168633619161630382098525129584202068464052357630633 6183730859560\n\n\n 65004063504559525007738276505391185322137155270201199057971 07651195404566504896517372220950102661115676898877913886840 8914387452650147975793533060274322762630\n\n\nNote that these numbers are obviously not prime; the convention of Cunningham and bi-twin chains (or at least the convention adopted by Sunny King) is that the \u201corigin\u201d of a chain is defined as either one less or one more than the first prime in the chain. This is done for convenience. If one wanted to retrieve some particular prime in the chain from the first prime, one would need to repeatedly multiply by two and subtract one at each step; using this convention, the formula is simply pn = w*2n-1, where n is the index of the prime and w is the origin. For Cunningham chains of the first kind, the formula would be pn = w*2n+1. Thus, the first prime in the smaller record-breaking chain is:\n\n15746436948707162347681191092622506406480521554672382866529 11336545168633619161630382098525129584202068464052357630633 6183730859561\n\n\nThe second prime is:\n\n31492873897414324695362382185245012812961043109344765733058 22673090337267238323260764197050259168404136928104715261267 2367461719121\n\n\nAnd so on.\nA list of records is being maintained by Dirk Augustin; the miners of blocks 2044 and 5355 have the option of proving who they are (eg. by sending a pre-specified quantity of primecoins from that address) in order to get their names on the list. Length-9 Cunningham chains of the first kind will be much harder to break records for; the current record is already 185 digits long. Cunningham chains of length 10, however, will be easy; the current records are 99 and 109 digits long, respectively. Ultimately however, the Primecoin communities should set their sights on a much more audacious goal: the first advance in mathematics made for the sake of Primecoin mining. In a few years, or perhaps even sooner, we may well get there.", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 11}

Danske Bitcoin is a service independently run by BIPS, and there are no formal agreements between BIPS and Danske Bank to facilitate the offering of this service\nBIPS, a Bitcoin payment processor based in Canada and Denmark, has just announced a new service: Danske Bitcoin, allowing users with Danske Bank\u2019s MobilePay service to instantly buy bitcoins from their phone. MobilePay an iPhone and Android application that allows anyone with a Danish bank account and credit card (and is over 15 years of age) to send money to other users instantly. MobilePay is currently making an introductory offer of no fees until January 1, 2014, at which point, DanskeBank\u2019s Mobilepay page reports, DanskeBank may add a fee that \u201cwill be a competitive price that reflects the costs of running the solution\u201d. Users need not be specifically in Denmark to buy bitcoins; as long as one\u2019s Danish bank account and credit card is active, the service works from all over the world, and the money will be immediately credited to one\u2019s BIPS account. As of July 14, the service is not released yet, but should come online soon.\nThe process to buy bitcoins with Danske Bitcoin is as follows:\nInstall DanskeBank\u2019s MobilePay app to your phone from the iPhone App Store or Google Play.Insert your bank account and credit card info on the BIPS website, as well as the number of the phone that you have installed MobilePay onGo into the application, go to \u201cSend\u201d and send any amount to BIPS\u2019s phone number (36965694)You should receive the equivalent in BTC credited to your BIPS account very soon\nBIPS has not seen nearly as much attention in the Bitcoin merchant processing space as its major competitors BitPay and Coinbase, but it has been seeing considerable growth particularly in Denmark, where the service\u2019s co-funder Kris Henriksen is located. The service is used by a number of businesses in Denmark, notably the popular online dating site single.dk, and also recently announced its latest customer: Flattr. Flattr is a service based in Sweden founded by Peter Sunde (best known for his work in The Pirate Bay) and Linus Olsson that allows users to easily donate small amounts to content creators on the internet. Users set an amount that they want to donate every month, and then while browsing they can click a button to tip individual creators. The monthly donation is evenly split among everyone tipped at the end of the month.\nPayment processing with BIPS is free if merchants wish to cash out directly in bitcoin, but charges a 2.5% fee in the form of a lower exchange rate for converting the bitcoins to a cash deposit in one\u2019s bank account. Merchants can opt to pass the fee on to customers (default), or absorb the fee themselves. BIPS also offers a number of additional features for a small fee, including MtGox integration and secure cold storage. BIPS can also be used to buy and sell bitcoins, and with this integration of DanskeBank\u2019s services using BIPS to buy bitcoins just got considerably easier for Danish users. Denmark remains one of the countries where Bitcoin is less widespread, with Google Trends showing a score of 49% compared to an average of 50%-70% across Europe, but thanks to the efforts of BIPS (and, to a lesser extent, Lasse Birk Olesen\u2019s Bitcoin Nordic) the community is growing.

{"title": "Predictious: Prediction Markets Are Coming Back\u2026 With Bitcoin", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/predictious-prediction-markets-are-coming-back-with-bitcoin-1373599083/", "birthday": "Jul 11, 2013  11:18 PM EST", "date": "2013-07-12 04:18:00", "content": "One of the more interesting applications of peer-to-peer finance is the concept of a prediction market - a market where people can speculate not on stocks and commodities, but rather real-life events. A prediction market might issue an asset that pays out $10 if Hillary Clinton wins the 2016 US presidential election, and $0 otherwise, and people would be free to either buy or sell the asset (short selling, or selling shares that you do not own to have a negative exposure, is just as easy as selling). The asset would then find a natural market price, say $2. If you think Hillary Clinton has more than a 20% chance of winning the election, it is in your interest to buy, and if you think he has less than a 20% chance then you can short sell. The idea is that, through the mechanism of the market, the opinions and information of millions of people around the world would be brought together to determine a sort of public estimate of the probability that something would happen. What is even more interesting is that even secret information would be brought into the calculation; if, for example, you secretly know that Hillary Clinton already has established plans to retire by then, you can short sell a large number of shares without telling anyone why, and your short sales will make the market price go down. \nUnfortunately, as far as actual working prediction markets go, right now there are few options. The world leader in the industry, InTrade, shut down in March this year due to what appear to be internal \"financial irregularities\", and so far no other has stepped up to take its place. This, of course, presents a prime opportunity for Bitcoin, and one that a number of sites, most notably betsofbitco.in and bitbet.us, have already attempted to seize. Today, though, a new contender is opening its doors: Predictious. The difference: unlike the previous contenders, Predictious works like an actual prediction market.\nBetsofbitco.in and Bitbet attempt to serve the save function as Predictious, but in a very important way they are actually quite different. Rather than having users buy and sell shares, both sites use a betting system known as \"parimutuel betting\". Users bet on events by placing their money into the \"yes\" pool or the \"no\" pool for each event. Whichever side is ultimately correct will have the value of both pools redistributed them in proportion to how much they personally invested, with an additional weighting factor to encourage earlier bets. The problems with this approach are several. First, there is no way to \"cash out\" of one\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s bet in the middle. Second, the time weighting is impossible to balance perfectly; too little time-weighting, and users can \"snipe\" near-certain outcomes one minute before the deadline of a given event and make a substantial profit, and too much time-weighting means that it becomes impossible to tell what the market thinks is the probability of an event happening from the size of the pools. In Predictious, you bet for or against events by buying or short selling shares, and the price of a share always accurately reflects the market\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s opinion of the probability of a given event. Finally, parimutuel betting is simply unintiutive compared to the relatively simple concept of buying and selling shares in a market, which Bitcoin users are already used to in the form of Bitcoin exchanges. \n\n Inside the Market \nPredictious was created by Flavien Charlon, a developer with a prior background in mobile applications and Facebook applications, and is his first Bitcoin-related project. The parent company, Pixode, is based in Ireland, and the project is currently largely a solo effort - \"although I am getting some help from a friend,\" Charlon points out. The site\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s interface is intuitive and easy to use. Users can look through the various predictions that the site offers listed by category (currently, the major categories are politics, sports, economics, entertainment, science and tech and business), and see the buy and sell prices listed beside each prediction. Each share pays out 10 mBTC if the underlying prediction proves true and 0 mBTC otherwise, so seeing a prediction with a price of 7 mBTC suggests that the market believes that the prediction has a 70% chance of coming true. \n\nThere are two places to click on each prediction in the above view; on the left, one can click to view a more detailed contract, and on the right one can click in the \"Buy\" or \"Sell\" area to get to the trading screen. On the trading screen, the user sees a form that looks much like buying or selling bitcoins on an exchange; they set a quantity and a price they wish to buy or sell at, and click \"Buy\" or \"Sell\" to confirm the trade. If a matching offer exists (eg. you sell at 4.50 mBTC and someone is already buying at 4.80 mBTC), your offer gets matched up against the matching offer most favorable to you, and you either gain a share, lose a share, gain a negative \"short share\" or lose a short share depending on the kind of offer you made and your existing exposure. Short shares are what you get when you attempt to sell shares of a prediction without having any shares to sell; essentially, they are the inverse of an ordinary share. For example, short-selling a share for 3.00 mBTC will withdraw 7.00 mBTC from your account, and return 10.00 mBTC if the prediction proves to be false and 0 mBTC is it turns out to be correct. If a matching order does not exist, your order gets put in the order book, and hopefully soon enough someone else will take your offer. Predictious itself intends to earn its money by taking a fee, currently set at 0.2 mBTC per share on every transaction.\n The Dreaded \"R-word\" \nOne question that is, and arguably should be, asked of nearly every new Bitcoin business in 2013 that goes beyond simply accepting the currency for payment or using it to pay employees is that of regulation. Financial services are a highly regulated industry, and the closure of InTrade should be viewed as a warning sign, particularly since Predictious is based in Ireland just like InTrade was. However, Intrade\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s home page provies us with the following information: \n We have now concluded the initial stages of our investigations about the financial status of the Company, and it appears that the Company is in a cash \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\xe2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\x80\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\x9cshortfall\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\xe2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\x80\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\x9d position of approximately US $700,000 when comparing all cash on hand in Company and Member bank accounts with Member account balances on the Exchange system....We are now very confident about the reasons which caused the current circumstance of the Company; however, for legal reasons we are not yet at liberty to document them to you. I can confirm that the Company, if it is able, intends to vigorously pursue two substantial monetary claims against two distinct parties for an aggregate amount greater than $3,500,000.\nThus, the true cause of the shutdown is very likely some kind of internal fraud, and not legal issues with InTrade itself. However, InTrade did have one run-in with the law. In November, InTrade was forced to close its doors to US customers following a complaint from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, one of the federal financial regulators of the US government.

The CFTC\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\xe2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\x80\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\x99s complaint also charges Intrade and TEN with making false statements concerning their options trading website in documents filed with the CFTC, and charges TEN with violating a 2005 CFTC cease and desist order (see CFTC Press Release 5124-05, October 4, 2005).\nFortunately, Predictious is somewhat less vulnerable than InTrade to this kind of regulatory attack. In theory, both companies could simply sit in Ireland and remain unaffected by the law of a foreign country. In practice, however, the US very often gets its way. The major avenue of attack is through banking relationships; had InTrade not complied, the US may well have forced local banks to block, or even seize, transfers to Intrade, putting large hurdles before US residents wishing to use the site. This strategy is used already in the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, which has one clause requiring US-based banks to withhold 30% of all transfers sent to international institutions that do not comply with the act\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s core requirements. Predictious, on the other hand, does not need any banking relationships with anyone. However, this does not mean that Predictious will want to violate US law; if nothing else, the US has the power to produce an arrest warrant within their own country, effectively banishing Charlon from one third of the developed world. But, although Predictious eventually may not be able to avoid blocking the US, that is not where its advantage lies; rather, Predictious has no way of actually enforcing a country-based restriction. IP address-based blocks are possible, and often used in practice, but virtual private network (VPN) services like PrivateInternetAccess (which also accepts bitcoins) can easily be used to pretend to be from another country. SecurityKiss\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s VPN is even free for basic usage.\nAs for Ireland\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s own laws, Charlon writes, \"regulations around gambling in Ireland only apply to services dealing with currencies like Euros or Dollars, which we don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t, so this may not even be coming into question before a few years.\" The idea of using Bitcoin as a currency not legally recognized as money in order to bypass regulations is not a new one; this was in fact the main legal premise of the gambling site SatoshiDice. However, in March 2013 FinCEN released a guidance stating that Bitcoin was indeed a form of virtual currency, and soon after that SatoshiDice decided that it was in their legal interests to start blocking IP addresses from the US (although circumventing that particular block is even more trivial; the SatoshiDice betting addresses have been copied to the Bitcointalk forums). In Ireland, nothing like this has happened - in fact, the country\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s government has not yet said a thing about the currency. Just like in the US, the situation may change, although arguably a pro-Bitcoin decision is more likely there. Hopefully, Predictious will remain untouched.\n Conclusion \nPrediction markets are an application for Bitcoin that really should have had multiple stable providers since 2011; beyond the standard difficulties relating to security, they are not technically hard to implement, and fill a valuable niche in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Predictious, with the effort put behind it, stands a solid chance of finally succeeding where its predecessors have failed, especially as it will be helped along by the higher volume of the Bitcoin community in 2013. The one thing that is still lacking is a good set of predictions; currently, the predictions essentially all have to do with the 2016 US presidential election, celebrities, top grossing movies or the Bitcoin price; a wider array of predictions relating to science and technology or economics would likely be well received by the Bitcoin crowd. However, this is easily fixable; the site has a form where users can submit questions, and a manual review process will look through the inputs and include those that meet the site\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s quality standards. In the near future, the site will likely add graphs to track the price of particular shares over time, and adding new predictions will also be a top priority. Given the lack of any true competitors in the Bitcoin economy, and the lack of a solid established player since the loss of InTrade, Predictious has a unique opportunity to not just carve out a niche in the Bitcoin space, but also to bring a considerable amount of attention to Bitcoin itself. With enough community support, and luck, it may do just that.", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 12}

The advertisement features a cartoon drawing shows a boardroom full of people (presumably government diplomats), each representing their respective national currency, with a new member walking in representing Bitcoin, and includes a QR code leading to a special landing page explaining the benefits of Bitcoin as an innovation in banking. The page compares the limited business hours, high merchant fees and security and privacy flaws of traditional banking to the benefits that we all know and love in Bitcoin: 24/7, near-zero fees, and maximum 0.6% fee with MtGox.\nThe G8 is one of the most important economic forums in the world, comprising eight of the world\u2019s eleven wealthiest economies: the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Russia. The organization holds annual summits, and this year the 39th is now taking place in Northern Ireland. Although the G8 has recently decreased in importance compared to the more recent, and more inclusive, G20 due to the rise of emerging economies such as China, Brazil and India, the organization nevertheless represents over 50% of the world GDP.\nBitcoin is only recently entering the conversation in the international political sphere, with a global forum on the legal challenges of virtual currencies having taken place at the World Bank and a paper released by the IMF this month. At this critical point in time, when governments are just trying to figure out how and to what extent they should regulate Bitcoin and work to integrate it into existing financial systems, a strong public relations effort from the Bitcoin community is vitally important, and MtGox is doing a service to the community by taking this step to present a government and business-friendly image for the currency. The tide may already be turning in Bitcoin\u2019s favor, as Jennifer Calvery, head of the US regulator FinCEN, has repeated her statement that she is, at least in principle, in favor of innovation in digital currencies (although the merits of her regulatory framework can of course be debated in practice), and so if the Bitcoin community continues to engage in public-relations efforts in government and banking forums Bitcoin may well get past much of the unfavorable treatment that the established financial system has been giving it, encouraging wider business adoption and making Bitcoin stronger for us all.", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 17}

Before March 2013, the Bitcoin community had had little more to go on than some various government reports, permission to use Bitcoin for political purposes from the New Hampshire Deputy Secretary of State, and a casual remark of approval from the Finnish Central Bank. Now that Bitcoin has become so (relatively) successful, however, governments from all over the world are watching, eager to figure out what they think is the best way to integrate cryptocurrencies into the established legal frameworks. The responses from around the world have been sometimes consistent, and sometimes wildly inconsistent even within the same country. This shows clearly an important lesson with regard to the nature of governments: although pro-government and anti-government advocates alike often tend to think of governments as monolithic entities which undertake certain strategies and enact policies in order to achieve speficied, whether benevolent or malevolent, goals, in reality government decision making can often be as disparate and chaotic a process as the private market, with hundreds of entities pulling in hundreds of directions tailored to their own specific interests and perspectives. Once one goes beyond a single country to the entire geopolitical scene, the divide becomes even stronger, albeit with certain general patterns. The purpose of this article will be to look at the government response to Bitcoin from all across the world over the past three months and determine the general trends.\nThe United States\nTo most Bitcoiners, the United States has become the epicenter of the great regulatory conflict. In the United States, money transmission regulation is among the most cumbersome in the world; in order to serve the entire country, a money transmitter must obtain a federal money services business (MSB) license from FinCEN and money transmitter licenses from 48 states. However, although the costs of participating in the US are so high, so are the benefits; the majority of Bitcoin businesses, and probably users, are located in the US. So far, excluding long-forgootten one-off statements like the words of Chuck Schumer, we have seen four major regulatory actions relating to Bitcoin:\nThe FinCEN guidance report \u2013 this was a document published in March 2013 that essentially sets out the guidelines for what the legal requirements for the various kinds of Bitcoin businesses are. Businesses and individuals simply using Bitcoin as a currency to trade goods and services are in the clear, but those trading bitcoins for other currencies (ie. exchanges) are legally defined as money transmitters, and need both the federal MSB license and an MT license for each state in which they operate or have customers.The MtGox Dwolla Seizure \u2013 in May, the Department of Homeland Security, in cooperation with the state government of Maryland, shut down MtGox\u2019s Dwolla account and may now be in the process of a criminal investigation. The charge: operating without a money services business license. MtGox\u2019s US subsidiary, Mutum Sigillum LLC, never obtained the federal MSB license and, when the company first opened their bank account in 2011, claimed that they would not be using their account for money transmission. This particular violation does not even rely on the FinCEN guidance; the claimed money transmission is the act of transmitting money between users\u2019 MtGox accounts and their Dwolla accounts in order to deposit and withdraw USD. Fortunately, this does not significantly affect the rest of the Bitcoin economy; all other major exchanges have had MSB licenses for many months, if not years, and are much more careful in their relationships with banks.The Bitcoin Foundation Cease and Desist\u2013 the state government of California has sent a formal letter to the Bitcoin Foundation, the non-profit group that has claimed for itself the role of promoting Bitcoin acceptance and development, demanding that they cease and desist their activities as a money transmitter. The request has taken the Bitcoin community by surprise; the Bitcoin foundation itself does not do any money transmission, and has nothing formally to do with Bitcoin beyond paying grants and a salary for lead developer Gavin Andresen.The GAO Report \u2013 the Government Accountability Office has published a report, mentioning Bitcoin numerous times by name, detailing when income received through virtual currencies is taxable. Essentially, economic interaction in virtual currency systems where the only possible exchange is between virtual currency and virtual goods and services, with neither the money nor the goods having any value outside the virtual environment, does not generate taxable income, but trades between physical goods and digital currency, or digital goods and fiat currency, are taxable. The report recommends that the Internal Revenue Service, the main US tax authority, help educate taxpayers about what kind of income in cyberspace is and is not taxable, but mentions that the IRS has specifically decided that it would not create any new rules specific to currencies like Bitcoin. \u201cGiven [the] uncertainty,\u201d the report writes, \u201cavailable funding, and other priorities, IRS made a reasoned decision not to implement a compliance approach specific to virtual economies and currencies.\u201d\nIn general, there appear to be two strands of thought with regard to Bitcoin inside the US government. First of all, there is a desire to recognize digital currencies as the next great innovation in the financial system, and simply figure out how to apply existing legal rules and standards to them. Following the Liberty Reserve shutdown in May, FinCEN chief Jennifer Calvery specifically said that Liberty Reserve was an isolated incident and Bitcoin exchanges that follow the rules \u201chave nothing to fear from Treasury\u201d.\nOthers, however, have a dimmer view of Bitcoin. The major piece of evidence for this is, once again, the Liberty Reserve case, although this time it is from a \u201cNotice of Finding\u201d by the Department of the Treasury. In the report, the author writes that \u201cLiberty Reserve is also a completely irrevocable payment system and digital currency. The fact that transactions are irrevocable, meaning that they cannot be reversed or refunded in the event of fraud, makes it a highly desirable system for criminal use and a highly problematic one for any legitimate payment functions.\u201d This can easily be interpreted as an indictment of Bitcoin; at the very least, it suggests that there are many people in FinCEN that would agree with the previous statement, and so have a reason to see Bitcoin as a whole (and therefore, by extension, all modern cryptocurrencies in general) as a fundamentally undesirable system.\nFinally, the Bitcoin Foundation cease and desist is likely to be one of two things: either simply the result of ignorance and confusion, not realizing the difference between a company and a nonprofit industry organization, or, as one post on Hacker News suggests, an attempt to expand the definition of money transmission to include the Bitcoin Doundation\u2019s activities. The FinCEN report is not binding on state governments, so once other state governments become more \u201cinstitutionally aware\u201d of Bitcoin\u2019s existence we may well see forty eight different approaches to handling it in forty eight states.\nOutside the US\nOutside the United States, there has been comparatively very little attention on Bitcoin; the few governments that have spoken out have mostly simply stated that Bitcoin earnings are taxable; usually, income earned in bitcoins is considered to be essentially equivalent to barter income, which government agencies around the world have already generally agreed is taxable for many decades. In that regard, we have:\nThe Australian Taxation Office has confirmed that Bitcoin transactions will be taxable. In fact, the ATO went a step further, discounting the claim that Bitcoin\u2019s privacy properties will make the organization\u2019s job especially difficult. \u201cBitcoin is no more anonymous than physical cash and the ATO has experience in working with earlier forms of \u00adanonymous electronic money systems, and with physical cash, which are relevant for responding to new and emerging \u00adsystems,\u201d ATO commissioner Michael Hardy told the Australian Financial Review.The Dutch government confirmed that although Bitcoin does not legally qualify as electronic money income earned in bitcoins is still taxable because the relevant income tax laws simply mention \u201cincome\u201d, not \u201cincome as money\u201d.The Canadian government specified that Bitcoin is indeed taxable in two ways: as barter if bitcoins are provided as income or sold as goods and services, or as capital gains if a Bitcoin user buys bitcoins at a low price and sells them at a higher price.Germany, interestingly enough, has taken a different tack. In Germany, a financial expert in the FDP, a classical liberal political party that is currently the third largest in the parliament, started an inquiry into Bitcoin\u2019s tax status that led to a surprising answer: that, due to a technicality in German tax law, capital gains earnings on Bitcoin (ie. buying low and selling high) are tax-free if the buy and sell are separated by at least a year. Barter taxes on earning bitcoins in exchange for goods and services still apply.\nIn terms of actually regulating Bitcoin exchanges, non-American governments appear to be fairly lax. In Canada, for example, FINTRAC, the Canadian government\u2019s equivalent to FinCEN, sent a letter to Bitcoin exchanges saying that Bitcoin exchanges are \u201cnot, at this time, engaged as a money services business in Canada as per the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing and its associated Regulations.\u201d The report continues: \u201cIn fact, your entity doesn\u2019t provide the services of remitting and/or transferring funds for the sake of the service. The transfer of funds is simply a corollary of your actual service of buying and selling virtual currency. Therefore, you do not have to register your entity with us.\u201d For Bitcoin businesses, currently Canada looks like a safe haven, and over the past three months Bitcoin business in Canada has increased massively. The Toronto Bitcoin meetups now have a few dozen attendees every time (up from ten at the first one in November), and bex.io, a company seeking to create the technical infrastructure for Bitcoin exchanges, has chosen to base itself in Vancouver. European governments have not made any such specifically positive measures toward Bitcoin, but so far they have proven themselves remarkably hospitable by inaction. The one major European government action, the takedown of Bitcoin24, was justified by suspected dishonesty on the part of the exchange, not any claims of legal illegitimacy of Bitcoin or the business of Bitcoin exchange itself.\nThe International Level\nAt the international level, government agencies are definitely watching. At the World Bank, a discussion panel was held on the legal and regulatory challenges behind Bitcoin, and two of the four panel discussions were about illicit commerce. The IMF has not actually released anything relating to Bitcoin yet, but one paper has one paper by a University of Chicago professor has put forward an argument essentially stating that, if Bitcoin becomes a larger part of the global economy, it will become part of the IMF\u2019s responsibility to protect Bitcoin if malefactors attempt to destabilize it. The paper even went so far as to suggest that member nations should consider \u201cgrant[ing] the IMF more direct control over Bitcoin by granting it and other digital currencies quasi-membership status\u201d \u2013 perhaps, purists would argue, allowing Bitcoin to be manipulated like gold (if gold is indeed being manipulated), but at the same time securing its legitimacy to an extent that makes the FinCEN guidance pale in comparison.\nBut there are also reasons to be worried. In an article in the G8 summit magazine (see page 60), John Lyons, the chief executive of the International Cybersecurity Protection Alliance wrote that \u201calternative payment mechanisms, such as Bitcoin and a host of others, can enable criminal and terrorist groups to launder money and fund their operations\u201d, and then proceeded to advocate that governments simply ban these mechanisms. \u201cIf treasuries and financial institutions around the world were to block those transactions,\u201d Lyons continues, \u201cand permit only legitimate currencies to be used on the internet through regulated payment service providers and cards (such as Visa, MasterCard and American Express), then the flow of many billions of dollars to criminal groups would be stemmed.\u201d The article\u2019s tone is brazen; the article literally contains the recommendation that governments \u201coutlaw alternative payment mechanisms for trading currencies online\u201d \u2013 not rogue payment mechanisms, or terrorist-friendly payment mechanisms, but specifically payment mechanisms that are alternative; that is to say, payment mechanisms that fall outside the status quo.\nLyons\u2019 words were published in the magazine that was read by hundreds of high-level government officials at the G8 summit but, fortunately for alternative payment system developers and enthusiasts, the ICSPA is not a government organization; the organization is rather a single-issue nonprofit, much like the World Wildlife Fund, and the article itself was nothing more than an opinion post by one of its members. Furthermore, MtGox published an ad in the very same magazine, seeking to reach out to government officials and pull them in the opposite direction. In general, the international opinion toward Bitcoin is very much undecided, and there is plenty of room for maneuver.\nConclusion\nMake no mistake: this is only the beginning of government attention and regulation of digital currencies. In 2011 and 2012, Bitcoin was much smaller and less significant than it is now, and governments produced an appropriate response: write a few papers but generally leave it alone. Now, the stakes are ten times higher, and so governments are willing to spend ten times as much effort. If Bitcoin becomes ten times more popular still in 2014, we can expect ten times as much governmental attention as we are seeing now. Many believe that the US government will slowly, but steadily, increase regulation on Bitcoin to the point of outright banning any services that attempt to interface it with the existing economy. Others believe that Jennifer Calvery is genuinely speaking the truth when she says that she is in favor of digital currency innovation in general. Outside the US, the outlook appears to be considerably more positive, although the US government is known for employing various strategies to push its own legal frameworks on the rest of the world \u2013 assuming, that is, that it manages to come up with a consistent internal opinion on Bitcoin in the first place. We are only now entering the eye of the storm, as the regulatory issues that are now being raised are every bit as significant \u2013 arguably much more significant, than those surrounding the regulation of cryptography in the 1990s. Then, the permissive solution won. We can only hope, and work together to ensure, that the same happens with cryptocurrency today.", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 27}

In addition to serving as an attractive method of payment, Bitcoin\u2019s free market, decentralized, cutting edge nature intrigues many professionals. Just last week BitPay, Inc. signed on a new merchant, Cohen Chiropractic Centre. Cohen Chiropractic Centre was founded in 2009 in Atlanta, GA and has grown to a level of prominence. Dr. Austin Cohen became interested in Bitcoin after one of his interns continually shared his excitement about this innovative currency. As Dr. Cohen has been featured on CNN, CBS News and spoken at various conferences for his innovative techniques to foster health and wellbeing for his clients, Bitcoin is just another source of opportunity and innovation he is able to now embrace.\nBitcoin Magazine had the privilege of interviewing and meeting Dr. Cohen and hopes to continue to be an information source for all things Bitcoin for Dr. Cohen.\nBitcoin Magazine: When did you first hear about Bitcoin?\nDr. Austin Cohen: I first heard about it through our intern as he would not stop talking about and every free moment he was reading an article about them. He insisted that I buy a Bitcoin for every person in my family.\nBM: What was it about Bitcoin that you found interesting?\nDr. Austin Cohen: There are 2 reasons why I decided to accept bitcoins in the office. First and foremost, the excitement and fun of something new that is developing and being part of it only a few years into it. Every time I google \u201cbitcoin\u201d a new article pops up that is either positive or negative but the fact people are talking about it makes it very fun. Second, is the simplicity of accepting them and making it easier for transactions and lower merchant service fees. Chiropractic is a progressive industry that is fun and exciting and being the first chiropractor in the World to accept them makes it that much more fun.\nBM: When did you first enter in the medical field?\nDr. Austin Cohen: I started chiropractic school in 2005 and it was my first year in school that I realized my opinions and statements are affecting the lives of many. I officially graduated in 2009 and opened my own clinic 7 months following graduation.\nBM: Were there any pre-existing businesses that inspired you to integrate Bitcoin into your business?\nDr. Austin Cohen: No, I personally do not know of too many businesses that accept Bitcoins.\nBM: Where do you see your office going in a year now that you have chosen to accept payment in Bitcoin?\nDr. Austin Cohen: I see us being able to connect more with other tech startups. They have all shared with me how great Bitcoin is and why I should take them and now I am excited to share with them about chiropractic and why it is so valuable for their life.\nBM: What makes your chiropractic services stand out in comparison to other chiropractic offices?\nDr. Austin Cohen: There are a few key distinctions but the big is one is we don\u2019t just want to get people out of pain but we want to correct the problem by putting together a plan and help them create their healthiest life. Some chiropractors are symptom based which is a reactive model and similar to medicine by waiting until a problem occurs then treat it. Our goal is to find problems before they become symptomatic and correct it through our specialized corrective techniques. We also do dynamic monthly workshops and have other resources for people to maximize their healthcare.\nBM: What are your suggestions for individuals hoping to start a business like yours and hoping to integrate Bitcoin into their businesses?\nDr. Austin Cohen: Do it!

The event is a week-long gathering on a campsite in northern New Hampshire, and every day is filled with a collection of liberty-themed panel discussions, music and games, and throughout the week there is a marketplace called Agora Valley, where merchants typically accept silver and gold as payment in addition to US dollars (or, as the locals prefer to call them, \u201cfederal reserve notes\u201d). In 2012, however, silver and gold were for the first time joined by their new upstart digital companion, with over 80% of merchants accepting Bitcoin as payment. \u201cI talked to some of the ones that didn\u2019t,\u201d Harvey added, \u201cand even they knew exactly what I was talking about. They were interested in doing it, but just hadn\u2019t gotten set up yet.\u201d This year, Bitcoin is expected to take on an even larger role at Porcfest. The Free State Project\u2019s keystone charities, including Antiwar and the medical group Fr33Aid, have started taking Bitcoin donations, and the latter has even converted to being a purely Bitcoin-based organization.\nBut what is this Free State Project that has let Bitcoin consume it to such a great extent? The underlying objective is simple. In 2001, a number of libertarian activists, disappointed with their failures to get anyone elected inside the United States\u2019 Republican and Democrat-dominated federal government, decided to try a different strategy: find a state that is (i) already very free in both personal and economic matters, and (ii) has a low population, allowing for smaller groups to achieve significant change, and convince 20,000 people to move to that state to actively influence local politics in a libertarian direction. New Hampshire proved to be the perfect candidate; its current population is only 1.3 million, allowing 20,000 movers to have significant control over state politics simply by playing the dominant and evenly matched Republicans and Democrats against each other, and as far as freedom is concerned one must only look as far as the state\u2019s motto: \u201cLive Free or Die\u201d.\nThe libertarian appeal of New Hampshire can be seen from the moment one drives in; on one highway leading into the state, on the border there is a sign stating that wearing seatbelts is mandatory for those under 18 \u2013 that is, unlike every other state, only for those under 18, with the \u201cLive Free or Die\u201d motto written below. The state is quiet and secluded; although the large southern towns like Manchester, Portsmouth and Concord do have bus routes, huge swaths of the state are completely inaccessible by public transportation, making them ideal for those who simply want to live undisturbed and peaceful lives with their families or in small communities far away from the rest of civilization; this sort of idyllic, \u201cdown-to-earth\u201d, ideology is especially popular in Graphton, which attracts libertarians with its lack of a building code. For those who enjoy the benefits of civilization, from Manchester Boston is only two hours away by bus. State politics is highly accessible, with 400 representatives in the New Hampshire State House of Representatives (of which about 20 are libertarians) making it easy for anyone to make their voice heard in government. There is no state income and sales tax, although the state makes up the difference via high property taxes \u2013 a highly successful partial implementation of a left-libertarian political philosophy known as Georgism.\nIn my own travels through the state, one common sentiment I have heard is that people here tend to view the local government very favorably; it would be a truly ideal place to live \u201cif only the feds would get out of the way\u201d. And this has a strong ring of truth; from this author\u2019s Canadian point of view, the federal government of the United States, with its bans on drinking alcohol or even entering many bars below age 21, requirements to show identification to board a bus, and constant DHS-funded reminders on TV telling people \u201cif you see something, say something\u201d, feels like a downright police state compared to the \u201cTrue North Strong and Free\u201d. Incidentally, the high age restriction on alcohol and bars has even led to me personally getting kicked out of a Bitcoin meetup here, although the meetup group was nice (and righteously angry) enough to relocate to a different location. Outside of libertarianism, the other main jarring thing about the United States to a Canadian is the sheer number of advertisements for various private and semi-private health care services.\nThe Free State Project movement in New Hampshire is essentially centered around two cities: Manchester and Keene. Manchester is important because of its (relatively) large population of 110,000, and by libertarian standards it has its credibility; CNNMoney ranks Manchester as the 13th best city to live and launch a business, and Yahoo ranks it the first in its list of tax-friendly cities. There are no Bitcoin-accepting restaurants yet in Manchester, although Lamassu\u2018s Josh and Zach Harvey are (at least currently) located in the city and organize a weekly meetup with about seven to ten participants.\nKeene is the undisputed \u201cliberty media capital of the world\u201c, with Free Talk Live, LRN.FM (\u201cLiberty Radio Network\u201d) and ten other libertarian shows located there, but is also the home of a much more activist, and controversial, part of the local libertarian movement that focuses heavily on civil disobedience. Marijuana is sometimes involved, and at other times the target is local rules prohibiting filming in courts or distributing pamphlets on school property. A particularly popular (and, in this case, entirely legal) activity is \u201cRobin Hooding\u201d, a deliberate strategy to deprive the Keene government of revenue from parking tickets by following parking inspectors around and filling expired parking meters right before the inspectors come to check any particular spot. Other Free Staters often disagree with the \u201cKeeniacs\u201d\u2018 actions, seeing them as needlessly provoking the local government even when some of the rules the activists are targeting are downright reasonable. \u201cI think some of the civil disobedience has been constructive and useful\u2014and much of it has not been,\u201d Free State Project founder Jason Sorens has said. If you wish to evaluate the merits of this side of the movement for yourself, consider watching their latest video Derrick J\u2019s Victimless Crime Spree and making your own conclusions.\nThe one Bitcoin-accepting restaurant currently in New Hampshire is the Pao Cafe in Newmarket, close to Portsmouth. The owner, Matt Corano, is himself part of the Free State Project, and is actively interested in Bitcoin for the ideological reasons. More will soon come; the Free Stater-owned Murphy\u2019s Diner in Manchester may accept it if at least one of its suppliers can be convinced to, and a number of restaurants on Manchester\u2019s Elm Street are potentially interested (although the Harveys are too busy with their Bitcoin ATM to spend too much time promoting Bitcoin adoption locally). But this is not to say that Bitcoin adoption is sparse; in fact, a very large number of people both in the Free State Project and elsewhere accept Bitcoin as payment for various kinds of services. The landlord I personally am staying with during my stay in New Hampshire, Alec Muller, accepts bitcoins for rent at a 20% discount, and Josh and Zach Harvey have managed to get a number of their graphic designers and suppliers to take them.\nThe other attraction of southern New Hampshire, and Manchester in particular, is its proximity to Boston, a city which has a strong Bitcoin community itself. The main character in Boston is Jay Best, an MIT research affiliate who has put together a weekly Bitcoin meetup group with, just like in Manchester, about seven to ten participants. However, in other ways Best has been more successful. There are now two restaurants accepting Bitcoin, Thelonious Monkfish and Veggie Galaxy.\n\nSee a few more pictures of Thelonious Monkfish and Veggie Galaxy here\nThelonious Monkfish appears to be simply an ordinary Asian fusion restaurant, albeit a highly rated one that is fully seated within half an hour of opening its doors at 11:30 on Sunday. Veggie Galaxy is a vegetarian restaurant, featuring veggie burgers, \u201csteaks\u201d, salads, coconut-based cocktails and various kinds of vegan desserts. Both restaurants have plenty of high-quality options on the menu at a reasonable price, although it is possible to get unlucky. More Bitcoin-accepting places are soon to come; first in line are a caf\u00e9 and a beer store, and both Best and other Bitcoin users are actively recruiting more. The ideological feel of the Bitcoin community is still largely libertarian, although a significant number are political moderates who like Bitcoin purely for its aspects of reducing transactional friction. The intent of the group is to simply focus on spreading Bitcoin adoption, as well as acting as a hotspot for Bitcoin activity; at the Bitcoin meetup last Friday, two people came to buy bitcoins from Best.\nNext week Bitcoin activity in Manchester and Boston will die down somewhat, as all the Bitcoiners will be heading over to Porcfest. The event will be taking place near Lancaster, NH, and tickets will be sold at the door for $75. Accomodations are heavily booked, so if you are not yet prepared to go your best bet may be either renting a room in a hotel 15km away or getting a tent and renting an RV spot. The local hotels and RV spots, unfortunately, do not accept Bitcoin. The first day of the fest will be tomorrow, although the more interesting events will take place later in the week.\nSee you at Porcfest!", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 15}
{"title": "Interview with Tuur Demeester", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/interview-with-tuur-demeester-1371692092/", "birthday": "Jun 19, 2013  9:34 PM EST", "date": "2013-06-20 02:34:00", "content": "Bitcoin Magazine had an opportunity to interview Tuur Demeester, author of the financial newsletter MacroTrends which goes to investors in the Netherlands and Belgium. Tuur pushed the Bitcoin to a higher level of prominence when he added Bitcoin as part of the recommended currency basket in January of 2012. Tuur views Bitcoin through an international lense, having so far lived in nine cities and traveled to thirty countries.\nPrior to his involvement in the Bitcoin currency, Tuur co-founded the Murray Rothbard institute in 2007 and additionally co-founded two private schools, one in Netherlands and one in Belgium. With a desire to spread free market economic ideas, Tuur translated Jesus Huerta de Soto\u2019s \u201cMoney, Bank Credit, and Economic Cycles\u201d into Dutch. As the current author of MacroTrends, Tuur recommended Bitcoin as an investment, starting from when it was $5 in early 2012.\nBitcoin Magazine: When did you first hear about and get involved in the Bitcoin currency?\nTuur Demeester: I first heard about Bitcoin when traveling in Argentina in the summer of 2011, my friends there couldn\u2019t stop talking to me about it. Seeing the very real way in which Bitcoin changed their daily lives and futures made it a lot easier for me to see its incredible potential.\nBM: How did you first get involved in the Bitcoin currency?\nTD: I think the current financial system is structurally insolvent and that we\u2019re entering an era of bank defaults, sovereign defaults, and destruction of currencies. That\u2019s why my initial interest in Bitcoin was from a wealth preservation standpoint. After I did my research, I tried to time the market and started buying bitcoins in February 2012. I recommended my subscribers do the same, and I\u2019ve been researching the space ever since\u2014the opportunities are quasi endless.\nBM: Can you elaborate on why Bitcoin is such a great investment?\nTD: I think Bitcoin and the crypto currencies are the greatest investment opportunity of our day and age.\nFirst of all because Bitcoin has all the qualities to make for an ideal money, to a greater extent than any digital or tangible commodity on the planet.\nSecond, in contrast with traditional fiat money, Bitcoin is designed for the internet: it\u2019s open source, it\u2019s mobile, fast, and it allows for personal privacy.\nThird, because we are approaching a bankruptcy event in the developed economies, both in banks and governments, I think that Bitcoin, as a discrete and nonconfiscatable currency, will benefit greatly from the capital flight that will ensue.\nBM: As you are an international traveler, out of the countries you have either lived in or visited, which holds the greatest potential for Bitcoin development and success?\nTD: I think some countries will prove to be excellent ecosystems for Bitcoin centered hard- and software companies, especially those countries with a history of commerce and with a political class that puts little obstacles in the way of \u2018cointrepreneurs\u2019. Countries that try to tax or control their local Bitcoin corporations too much will lose it, just like how medieval France\u2019s rising taxes pushed merchants away from the Champagne Fairs to the harbor cities of the Hanseatic League, which could not be reached by the French royalty. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see Bitcoin corporate activity blossom in peripheral countries like Thailand, Sweden, or Panama\u2014but what the physical centres will become is hard to say as it is so dependent on political decisions.\nAs far as Bitcoin adoption goes, it\u2019s clear to me that countries with a large informal economy (cash market) in place, are at an advantage. The same goes for countries with a history of embracing new technologies easily. There is also the fear factor, because economic panic in a specific country will seriously speed up Bitcoin adoption in that place. Taking all that in consideration, I think a place like Argentina, or an Eastern European country may very well end up being the first with cities where you can put gas in your car, buy groceries, and get paid at work, all of it transacted in Bitcoin.\nBM: What is the outlook for the Bitcoin communities in the Netherlands and Belgium?\nTD: I think the outlook for Bitcoin adoption and innovation in the Benelux is bright, as we [are] a culture of software innovation (it\u2019s no coincidence that 2 of the 6 Bitcoin core developers are from the low lands), a very high internet penetration rate, and an internationally oriented culture. The community here is still small, but every week I talk to new investors and entrepreneurs who show interest in doing something with Bitcoin.\nBM: What will it take to get Bitcoin to a higher level of utility and prominence?\nTD: All it takes is for things to continue the way they are. It\u2019s a marvel to witness how the market self-organizes, and how entrepreneurs globally are continuously adapting to new challenges. This process will continue and it will continuously push the Bitcoin economy towards mainstream adoption.\nBM: Where do you see the Bitcoin currency in a year?\nTD: From here we could see further consolidation, possibly until late 2013. Early 2014 I think we\u2019ll see a recovery with the old high of $260 as a technical target. If the market is ready and the high is broken, then $500 is feasible. If the old high is not broken in the next twelve months, my base case projection for Bitcoin is $1000 before the end of 2015.\nBM: What is your favorite aspect or characteristic of the Bitcoin currency?\nTD: Personally, I love the fact that it is a currency designed to provide privacy. There are really only two functional economical strategies to solving systemic crime and conflict in the world, and those are the removal of scarcity (creation of abundance) and the reasonable restriction of access to an individual\u2019s person and property. Bitcoin makes it possible to easily and effectively draw the line between what\u2019s mine and what\u2019s thine, and that\u2019s why I believe [it] will turn out to be a great force for good in the world.\nBM: What advice would you give to individuals who are just learning about Bitcoin and looking for ways to get involved?\nTD: Buy some! And try a few of the many services that are available in Bitcoin today to experience for yourself what real financial freedom means. Several people I know only became convinced about the potential when they decided to use bitcoins for an actual transaction, which showed them how efficient the system really is.\nBM: What can Bitcoin Magazine readership and staff do to get Bitcoin to become a household name?\nTD: In my experience, something only starts making sense to people when they can connect it to another thing they already care about. So I think a good general strategy is to really be open to people\u2019s goals and values, and to only then see whether Bitcoin might play a role in achieving those goals and in meeting those needs. Since I started paying more attention to that, my Bitcoin pitches have become much more effective.\nI also think that many people underestimate the power that lies in just buying some Bitcoins. By that simple act, you help increase liquidity in the market, which allows ever bigger businesses to start accepting the currency. Your purchase also effectively helps raise the value of the currency across the Bitcoin economy, which provides all the cointrepreneurs and their investors with more purchasing power, and that allows them to build better services that make Bitcoin really user friendly\u2014allowing it to become the digital currency also used by grandmothers.\nBitcoin Magazine thanks Tuur for his time and insight and would like you to heed his advice and not only buy bitcoins but to also share about Bitcoin with your family and friends! You can listen to Tuur\u2019s talk presentation at the 2013 Bitcoin Conference in San Jose here and stay up to date on his role in the Bitcoin community at www.tuur.demeester.com.", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 20}
{"title": "Kenilworth Exploration: Bitcoin Crowd Investing Meets Real-World mining", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/kenilworth-exploration-bitcoin-crowd-investing-meets-real-world-mining-1371256176/", "birthday": "Jun 14, 2013  8:29 PM EST", "date": "2013-06-15 01:29:00", "content": "Bitcoin-based investment platforms have had a long and colorful history in the past two years. The idea first started with the Global Bitcoin Stock Exchange, launched in April 2011. The exchange picked up quickly, with mining companies and the in-person Bitcoin exchange Ubitex as the first IPOs, but within months the exchange ran into its downfall: quality control. In December, the GLBSE-based Lambert Investment Funds, a fund which invested in other GLBSE assets, was forced to shut down because many of their investments turned out to be scams, and in August 2012 the GLBSE suffered a further blow as a $5 million Ponzi scheme suddenly disappeared, taking nearly half the GLBSE \u201ceconomy\u201d with it. Not long after, the GLBSE itself shut down for legal reasons. Since then, however, other platforms with much better quality control have taken the GLBSE\u2019s place, and Bitcoin investments have seen a massive, but quiet, renaissance. The gambling site SatoshiDice and the Bitcoin mining company ASICMiner are listed on trading platforms MPEX and BitFunder with market capitalizations of $25 million and over $130 million, respectively, and BitFunder has over a dozen assets listed on the site, including such mundane businesses as the T-shirt vendor Bitcoin Pride.\nNow, an Australian mining company is about to take the Bitcoin stock markets to the next level. At the beginning of June, Kenilworth Exploration, a mineral exploration company located in the Lachlan Fold Belt in New South Wales, Australia, announced that it will be raising its first $925,000 round of funding using BitFunder. This sets a new first in the Bitcoin economy; although there have been many businesses in industries as diverse as Bitcoin exchange, Bitcoin mining, promotional clothing and gambling raising money from Bitcoin investors through such platforms, Kenilworth Exploration is the first business from outside the Bitcoin community to seek investment from Bitcoin users.\nThe backstory of the company begins at the turn of the century. In 2000, the Prendergast family bought a 96,000-acre farm in New South Wales, Australia, and in 2001 prospectors found a number of unexplored mineral deposits in the area. Kenilworth Exploration was founded in 2006 as a Prendergast family-owned business, and in 2010 the company purchased three exploration licenses. The company also secured a 50% stake in three additional licenses by partnering with Thomson Resources Ltd, an accredited mining company which is also based in Australia, and in 2012 Kenilworth filed to become a public company, although without immediately listing on any actual exchange.\nKenilworth\u2019s founders first found out about Bitcoin in just the same way as so many of the rest of us. \u201cIn 2011,\u201d Daniel Prendergast explains, \u201cI was reading an article on Slashdot and was really interested in the emerging technology that is Bitcoin. I was studying for my medical exams and, in a moment of procrastination, I thought that there could be a great link between my dad\u2019s company and Bitcoin. Once Bitcoin spiked above 100, I knew it was going to be a viable option, I found BitFunder, and we made contact.\u201d As for why the company\u2019s board was so eager to go along with the alternative funding method, as Daniel\u2019s father and Kenilworth chairman Patrick Prendergast describes it, there was nowhere else to turn. \u201cMineral exploration globally is in serious decline because of the economic downturn, and the raw material supply [available in the earth] of copper started declining, so the industry fell down and everyone stayed with the companies that were still above ground.\u201d The result of the consolidation: an oligopoly, with all the standard inefficiencies and pitfalls. \u201cThe established companies have such huge overheads, that out of every $1000 they\u2019re spending $600 just to stay afloat.\u201d Other mining companies have tried raising funds on conventional stock exchanges, but as of yet none have succeeded.\nThe Bitcoin markets, however, are a completely different animal. Traditional stock exchanges have a reputation for being largely dominated by mutual funds, billionaires and institutional investors such as banks, but Bitcoin users tend to be young and middle-aged tech entrepreneurs, a very different demographic. Additionally, the barriers to entry are far lower; there are no complex registration processes, there is only a two-minute signup and a one-hour Bitcoin deposit to get on BitFunder. Even someone with only $25 to invest can participate. The Prendergasts are hoping that this unique advantage of Bitcoin, the ability to serve as an efficient method of crowd funding, will be what allows them to succeed where many other companies have failed.\nKenilworth itself is adopting a strategy that has already become very popular among many in the tech community. \u201cWe\u2019re a virtual company,\u201d Prendergast explains. Kenilworth Exploration is responsible for collecting the funds, paying for the exploration licenses and the electromagnetic scans, and for \u201ckeeping things together\u201d, but the company itself will do very little internally. Instead, the company has hired contractors to do nearly all of the actual work. The company has already enlisted the services of SRK Consultancy Ltd to conduct an independent geological valuation, which found that \u201cthe Kenilworth licences sit in prospective geological addresses similar to that of the world class Peak Gold Mine, hosting shear/structural land formations that cultivate significant gold and copper mineralisation, as well as possible porphyry styles that are conducive towards gold-rich and copper-rich resource findings.\u201d As a result, Kenilworth\u2019s three exploration licenses \u201chave a median valuation of US$ 19.1 million with a minimum valuation of US$ 3.5 million, and a maximum valuation of US$ 264 million.\u201d\nInvestors have a good deal; the shares on BitFunder are being sold at a market capitalization of only $5.4 million. The next phase will be to use the $925,000 funding that Kenilworth ideally prefers to receive entirely from the Bitcoin community to fund the next phase of exploration: a high-powered electromagnetic helicopter survey. After this scan, the company will once again seek a mineral asset accredited company, perhaps also SRK, to conduct another geological valuation; at this point, it is expected that the valuation will be \u201cmany times higher\u201d than the original $19 million; at this point, Prendergast expects $50-$70 million. At this point, there will be two further funding rounds at higher valuations, which will pay for the actual drilling program. For this too Kenilworth intends to use the services of an existing accredited mining company such as Thomson Resources, and the way the company goes from there will depend heavily on the precise nature of the contract. Kenilworth may simply sell off its licenses to its mining partner, delivering a large payoff to investors on the spot, or it may simply end up collecting royalties and paying out dividends over time. Either way, however, BitFunder acts as a fully functional stock exchange, so investors are free to cash out at any time at a potentially massively increased share price.\nOf course, Kenilworth may well not get the entire $925,000; the Bitcoin economy is riddled with businesses which, seeing the massive success of companies like ASICMiner and SatoshiDice, sought to get large amounts of funding themselves, but only ended up getting as little as $10 for their trouble. However, there are backup plans. If Kenilworth does not get $925,000, they will simply start the helicopter survey one exploration license at a time; the smallest amount of funding that the company will need to get to start is $250,000. Once the first survey goes successfully, it will be much easier for Kenilworth to acquire additional funding. If Butterfly Labs, a Bitcoin mining company, managed to secure $250,000 worth of pre-orders within 24 hours of their launch in June 2012, it is not hard to imagine the real-world mining company Kenilworth Exploration receiving at least $250,000 within two months in June 2013.\nBeing the first non-Bitcoin company to seek funding from Bitcoin user \u201ccan be a little daunting,\u201d Patrick Prendergast admits. \u201cWe have to ensure that the money from BitFunder gets to the various subcontractors, but there is no precedent to follow, so accountants and solicitors get a bit nervous. I think that\u2019s why there is not a crowd of other companies doing this, and so we have to lead the way. If we do this, there are many others who could follow suit.\u201d Legal issues are also an unknown, although there are no obvious reasons to believe the government would attempt to crack down; Kenilworth is a public company, making the situation much simpler as there are no restrictions on who the company can receive money from. Ordinarily, such a step would be very difficult for a public company to take; in Kenilworth\u2019s case, however, the vast majority of the company ownership remains in the Prendergast family\u2019s hands, allowing the family to make the decision unilaterally. Even so, the company\u2019s board is very supportive of the decision regardless.\nAt this point, what the company needs more than anything else is attention; although there is no reason why they cannot raise $250,000, or even the full $925,000, from the Bitcoin community within two months, they need to make potential investors aware of their existence in order to do so. There are many untapped markets to explore; Bitcoin has been very popular in China recently, with even more Bitcoin-Qt downloads in China than the United States since mid-April this year. \u201cThe Chinese love Australia and are very interested in mineral exploration,\u201d Prendergast believes, and so there is no reason why a large portion of the funding cannot come from Chinese Bitcoin users. Anyone looking to expand their investment portfolio beyond just technology should well consider Kenilworth as a unique, and potentially highly lucrative, opportunity. Although, if they succeed, their interest in the Bitcoin markets will hopefully not be nearly so unique two or five years down the line.", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 15}
{"title": "Bitcoin At Porcfest, Part 2: The Porcfest Ideology", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-at-porcfest-part-2-the-porcfest-ideology-1371764701/", "birthday": "Jun 20, 2013  5:45 PM EST", "date": "2013-06-20 22:45:00", "content": "This article was originally part of Bitcoin at Porcfest, Part 1: A Social Experiment, and has been split off because it deals with a separate topic that deserves to be treated on its own\nIn the past three days, we have seen Porcfest attendees successfully applying Bitcoin in real-world usage, with between a quarter and a half of all transactions taking place using the currency. In a practical sense, Bitcoin and Porcfest go extremely well together; Porcfest needs merchants to feed its attendees, merchants need a currency, and Bitcoin is a currency that desperately needs real-world merchants to test it.\nBut what is just as interesting is how well Bitcoin fits in to the core Porcfest ideology. Initially, libertarianism (and its more extreme strand, anarcho-capitalism) was a political movement just like social democracy or conservatism, seeking to secure progressively greater freedom for everyone through political advocacy and elections. More recently, however, many in the libertarian movement have become discouraged by its failures in the political sphere, and over the past ten years the primary focus of many libertarians, and anarcho-capitalists especially, has shifted massively. Now, the Free State Project mode of thinking starts by asking a simple question: if we had a society where governments were much weaker than they are today, or even outright nonexistent, what alternative institutions would we need to ensure that such a society can thrive? Then, given the answer, the solution is to start implementing these institutions today.\nThe result is a holistic anti-authoritarian philosophy that rejects governmental, corporate and even parental authority alike, and seeks to rebuild what it sees as a more peaceful, and ethical, world from the ground up. The contract I had signed with my own temporary landlord in Manchester made clear that it would be enforced by ostracism and public shame, not courts backed by the physical force of law. Because the libertarian and Bitcoin communities are both so tightly linked, even not taking into account basic morality I would not dare ransacking my landlord\u2019s home and running away with as much property as I could even if there was no law enforcing it, simply because I would not risk being publicly shamed and ostracized by both communities at the same time. A political movement which many detractors decry for its extreme individualism proves to be surprisingly communitarian.\nIn a community featuring such a strong presence of alternative, government-free \u201claw\u201d, government-free (and corporation-free) education, government-free private charity healthcare and government-free common defense in the form of an active gun community, what role can Bitcoin take? The answer is, as the basis of an alternative, government-free economy. Gold and silver had been taking on this role before 2012, but now that Bitcoin has appeared there is a very subtle, but growing, feeling that gold and silver are in some sense impure. The security of gold and silver possession is backed by legal property rights, using gold on the internet requires centralized parties that must constantly, and sometimes unsuccessfully, take steps to placate government authorities. Bitcoin, on the other hand, bases its security on nothing but math.\nSure, Bitcoin is imperfect, and is vastly inferior to currencies based on gold and silver as a stable store of guaranteed value, but as far as internet currencies go it has one advantage that its potential alteratives do not: Bitcoin is here, now. And it doesn\u2019t stop there. The Bitcoin protocol allows for the mathematically secure execution of complex legal relationships such as assurance contracts, and on top of Bitcoin one can potentially build constructs like smart property, which uses Bitcoin to independently enforce property rights on physical objects like cars, houses and smartphones.\nAll this is not to say that Bitcoin is explicitly a libertarian technology; the fact that Bitcoin would fit well into a libertarian world by no means implies that it benefits nobody else. European Bitcoin activists, for example, often follow what we would term a much more \u201cleft-wing\u201d philosophy, although the underlying dislike of some sort of government or corporate establishment often still remains. Liberals, in the American sense of the word, can see a cosmopolitan appeal in Bitcoin from its unrestricted internationality. And, last but not least, ordinary people without any particular ideology at all can benefit from Bitcoin because of its lower transaction fees, near-instant transactions and lack of a chargeback mechanism. For now, Bitcoin can simply be seen as a great social experiment, simultaneously testing the mathematical viability of a decentralized currency, the willingness of the public to adopt an amalgamation of old and new patterns of behavior, and the mainstream financial system\u2019s response to something which has never existed before. The libertarians at Porcfest, having already embarked on a social experiment of their own, are jumping in en masse. Regardless of whether you are a libertarian or not, the time may be just right for you to do the same.", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 20}
{"title": "Bitcoin At Porcfest, Part 1: A Social Experiment", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-at-porcfest-part-1-a-social-experiment-1371713328/", "birthday": "Jun 20, 2013  3:28 AM EST", "date": "2013-06-20 08:28:00", "content": "To understand more about what Porcfest is and why Bitcoiners should care, see part 0 of this series.\nToday marks the third official day of Porcfest, and already hundreds of people have showed up. In the nine Porcfests before this one, attendance has always trickled up slowly, with only a few people present on Monday and the event ramping up to full force on Friday and Saturday. This year, those who have attended previous Porcfests are saying that as many people have come to this Porcfest already as came to the previous one by Friday, and the number of attendees is expected to continue growing as the week continues to progress. Over 1100 people preregistered for the event by the online registration deadline of June 1, roughly as many as the number of people attending the Bitcoin conference in San Jose. Between the recent leaks regarding NSA wiretaps, the Free State Project breaking 14,000 participants and the continuing economic crisis in general, the Free State Project appears to be rapidly entering the mainstream.\nLast year, Bitcoin made a very strong appearance at Porcfest 2012, with what Josh Harvey described as 80% of merchants at the fest accepting it. This year, Bitcoin is taking on an even more central presence than before. Erik Voorhees\u2019 SatoshiDice is the event\u2019s largest sponsor, the main tent used for presentations is called the \u201cBitTent\u201d, and aside from the three presentations that are discussing Bitcoin (the first of which attracted a full tent of listeners today) many other speakers, like Jeff Bush, are actively promoting it as a key part of their larger philosophies of personal and economic liberty.\n\nAnd, last but not least, there is Agora Valley. Agora Valley is a marketplace located fairly close to the presentation tents where merchants are free to set up stores to sell food and merchandise. This is the main destination where Porcfest attendees can go to get food between the various presentations and events. Just like last year, a majority of merchants accept Bitcoin, although a few (including, unfortunately, two of the only three vegetarian/vegan-friendly restaurants) still do not. On the customer side, those merchants who do accept Bitcoin are reporting that between a quarter and a half of their sales are done with it. In this regard, Porcfest is a true Bitcoin event in a way that even the Bitcoin conference in San Jose was not; here, hundreds of largely non-technical, ordinary, people were actually using Bitcoin to buy and sell food and merchandise in real life, and learning along the way.\nIn the campground in the forests of northern New Hampshire where this year\u2019s PorcFest is taking place, the main impediment to Bitcoin usage is obvious: internet connectivity. The campground itself provides an internet hotspot for $15 for a week, but the only way to pay for it is by credit card; even buying in person with cash is not possible. And even that connection is shaky; Porcfest veterans report that last year by Wednesday there were so many people that the internet was barely usable, and this year the connection is somewhat better but not by much. To alleviate this, two Porcfest attendees have come up with solutions. Lamassu\u2018s Matt Whitlock has set up a \u201cBitcoin-only wifi\u201d hotspot which is free for anyone to connect to, but which only offers access to a few publicly known Bitcoin nodes and Electrum servers and blockchain.info. This internet is accessible throughout the entire campground, and nearly all Bitcoin users at Porcfest are relying on it to make and receive transactions. Another attendee has set up a paid internet hotspot of his own, offering access for the duration of Porcfest for 0.047 BTC or $6 USD. The other major impediment to Bitcoin usage \u2013 namely, obtaining bitcoins in the first palce, was solved by Lamassu\u2019s Bitcoin ATM, with which anyone can trade cash for bitcoins at a 1% fee. Lamassu\u2019s Matt Whitlock reports that the ATM has sold over $1600 worth of bitcoin at Porcfest so far.\n\nFor those interested in using Bitcoin at farmer\u2019s markets, a Bitcoin-only wifi hotspot seems like the perfect solution; between it and the Lamassu machine, the infrastructural problems with using Bitcoin at Porcfest are largely solved. But the event does show a larger problem with accepting Bitcoin in person: usability. Although Bitcoin does, in theory, allow a customer to pay a merchant in two seconds by simply scanning a QR code and hitting send, in practice there are very many technical glitches that can increase the time it takes to make a payment to over a minute. Sometimes some glitch on the merchant side, whether relating to internet connectivity or simple software lag, causes the merchant to spend an extra few seconds getting the QR code up for the customer to scan. On the customer\u2019s side, sometimes the customer\u2019s application takes a long time to load or send the transaction, and sometimes simply scanning the QR code takes ten seconds longer than usual. Finally, even after the customer scans the transaction it can take as long as fifteen seconds for the merchant to see it on their own device.\nFor Bitcoin wallet developers, events like Porcfest are essentially mandatory. Seeing real people use Bitcoin in real-life scenarios, often for the first time, shows that there are many steps that Bitcoin wallet developers can take to make the user experience faster and more convenient. At this point, the slighest optimizations can help; even a one-second speedup in an average interaction will go a long way toward making Bitcoin a more pleasant currency to use in person. From my own viewpoint, here are some basic improvements that mobile Bitcoin wallets could make:\nMake the \u201cScan QR code\u201d button when sending bitcoins four times larger. One should not have to spend a full second aiming with one\u2019s finger and another two seconds making multiple attemps in order to successfully click it. In fact, all interface elements that need to be clicked on should be twice as large, filling up all available whitespace as much as possible.Once the destination address is entered, do not just move the cursor focus to the textbox showing the amount to pay; also, force the onscreen keyboard on touchscreen phones to open up. Currently, the user must often first touch the textbox with their finger before the onscreen keyboard appears.Readily offer the ability to set the amount to pay in USD or other local fiat currency rather than requiring the customer to determine the BTC value based on the current price themselves (at least in cases where the merchant is not generating all-inclusive QR codes containing both the destination address and the price.When spending a transaction output, return change in many pieces. This allows the user to later make many transactions one after the other without them being dependent on each other in a chain.\nHowever, the largest improvements that could be made are not in software, but rather in etiquette. Cash and credit cards have both been around for decades, and there is a large amount of unspoken knowledge that helps smooth over the inefficiencies of these systems. With cash, one example of such an unspoken custom is the concept of \u201cchange\u201d. If you need to pay $7.93 but only have $10, you do not need to spend time explaining to the merchant that you are giving them too much so that they give you the difference back; the merchant already knows this, and even keeps a large number of low-denomination coins and bills on hand to facilitate this tradition. With credit cards in a restaurant, there is the custom of leaving a bill on the table for the customer to take out their card and write in a tip, so as not to require the waiter to waste their time at the table waiting for the customer to do this. The question we now need to answer is: what are some good social norms that can help govern and facilitate in-person Bitcoin transactions? From my own experiences paying with bitcoin in restaurants in Boston and at merchants at Porcfest, here are some suggestions:\nIn a restaurant, ideally the waiter should not awkwardly wait by the customer\u2019s table while the customer tries to make a Bitcoin transaction. Instead, there should be a setup with which the waiter can leave a QR code printed on paper, or on a tablet, on the customer\u2019s table and leave the customer to figure out any technical difficulties in the payment process by themselves. This is equivalent to the similar custom for credit cards.If (1) is not practical, a waiter should look not at their own payment application, but at the customer\u2019s, to see if the payment has been made. Theoretically, a fraudulent customer could create a fake Bitcoin application to pretend to pay, but it is already very easy for dishonest customers to run away from a restaurant without paying, or paying a trivial amount in $1 or $5 bills that looks like a more substantial payment from afar, so this is not a substantial risk.Merchants should consider printing a large QR code on paper, and letting the customer scan it and then enter the payment amount manually. This allows the customer and the merchant to work in parallel, and is used successfully by many merchants at Porcfest as well as the Pao Cafe in Newmarket, New Hampshire. Printing a large QR code is especially important, as it makes scanning much easier.\nAs merchants continue to experiment with various ways of accepting Bitcoin, the community will likely start to develop more and more precise versions of these rules all on its own. One idea that has been suggested is to make an explicit Bitcoin Fest, an event similar to Porcfest but specifically focused around Bitcoin, not libertarianism. This could happen in 2014 in lieu of, or together with, a more formal Bitcoin convention, or even in 2013 there are not yet any major Bitcoin-related events this year in August or December. Another option is the progressive approach: simply continue working hard on evangelizing Bitcoin and recruiting restaurants within one\u2019s own local area. Set up a meetup group that will meet at a particular time and place every week, and invite anyone from the public to come, learn about Bitcoin and try out using it. Ideally, this would take place inside a Bitcoin-accepting restaurant, so new Bitcoin users could make their first transaction in the presence of a helpful community. Regardless of what direction we want to take, if we want to see Bitcoin truly break out into the real world, actually bringing Bitcoin into the real world and seeing it applied in practice is the only way that we could actually get there.\nTo see the full-resolution versions of the pictures used here, and a few others, visit our album here.", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 20}

The machine, which allows anyone to insert bills, scan their receiving address and immediately receive bitcoins at a 1% fee, has sold over 16 BTC in the first three days of the event, and its popularity is only growing as the number of participants ramps up. But the aim of the machine is much larger than just one annual libertarian event; Lamassu's founders Josh and Zach Harvey intend to make many more machines and sell them to merchants interested in operating one in many countries around the world. Here, Lamassu's Josh Harvey answers our questions.\nVitalik Buterin: What first gave you the idea to create a Bitcoin ATM?\nJosh Harvey: It stemmed from our frustration in obtaining Bitcoin quickly and seamlessly. The infrastructure of Bitcoin is improving every day, yet at this point it can still be frustrating exchanging fiat into Bitcoin. Especially for first time Bitcoin users. The Bitcoin machine idea was to simplify it all. No signing up, no thirty day wait, just cash to bitcoins. The Bitcoin Machine takes the banks out of the picture for the end user, and that can really streamline the process.\nVitalik Buterin: What was the main difficulty in the project?\nJosh Harvey: The last few days before the prototype debut in Washington, DC (The ISFL Conference). There were a few last bugs that took three straight sleepless nights to fix. We had a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experience and another three sleepless nights leading up to the Bitcoin 2013 convention in San Jose, to get our second prototype working perfectly. At least this time we weren't still working on it from our hotel room.\nVitalik Buterin: It seems like security might be a particular risk, from both a hardware and software standpoint. What steps have you taken to ensure that thieves can't quickly steal the machine or break it apart or attempt to access its wallet with software-based attacks?\nJosh Harvey: The production Bitcoin Machines will have a thick steel chassis and will be bolted to a counter, a wall or a permanent stand. These machines are intended to be installed inside, in storefronts, cafes, and other retail locations. The operator can be alerted every time there is more than say $5,000 in the machine, and it's expected that he will deposit the cash every night. Much of the design work for the production version is focused around both physical and network security. We have very capable people thinking through every part, so we're confident that the machine will be over-engineered for its intended use. Another thing to remember is that our first design will only be fiat to BTC, so we don't have to plan for as much cash as a legacy ATM machine. \nOn the software side, we'll be providing the software for the machine itself, as well as software for a remote server. The remote server will be run by the operator, not by us, but it will be very easy to deploy, for example as a pre-built Amazon EC2 image. We have a lot of experience with network security and we'll have the design audited by top people in the Bitcoin security field. Part of the design process is working on good policies for software updating and private key management.\nVitalik Buterin: how hard would it be to adapt the machine to other currencies (eg. CAD, EUR) so it can be used internationally?\nJosh Harvey: Actually, we are only looking at components that will accept all of the major currencies of the world. Even the first production models will be available for 80-100 different currencies. We have already tested our current prototype with Canadian dollars.\nVitalik Buterin: I saw that you're planning on creating more of these machines and selling them to merchants. Have you made any deals yet? If so, what cities will your first few merchants be in? What's the timetable for the machines to be created, delivered and turned on?\nJosh Harvey: Yes, we are indeed putting these into production. We've received an incredible amount of interest from every corner of the world. Some examples are Pakistan, Libya, Macau, and Australia. We've been getting a lot of emails from Canada, in particular. We haven't begun taking pre-orders yet but we expect to start doing that in about a month. We're planning to ship our first production run end of summer 2013.\nVitalik Buterin: Are you at all worried about legal risks (money laundering, etc)?\nJosh Harvey: It is something we are constantly looking into. We believe that hardware manufacturing of a vending machine (it is not legally considered an ATM) is less of a legal problem than money transmitting services but researching these issues is definitely part of the production process. We are definitely making sure that our prospective customers are aware of the regulations they might be subject to.\nVitalik Buterin: Do you have any plans for a machine that could convert between fiat and BTC both ways? It seems like the other direction would be even more useful for tourists, for example.\nJosh Harvey: The first design will be cash in, Bitcoin out. A dual exchange machine would be more expensive to produce, larger, and more difficult to secure (both physically and developing solutions for double spends). Such a machine would likely pose more regulatory challenges in some jurisdictions. Yes, we do have plans to design one in the future!", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 21}

He was the president of the Mises institute from 2009-2012 ans is currently the senior editor of Laissez Faire Books, a libertarian book publisher run by Jeffrey Tucker. He is also well known for having been and for writing Walk Away: the Rise and Fall of the Home Ownership Myth, a libertarian look at the events and ethics of the housing bubble. Here Doug French has agreed to talk about his views on Bitcoin and the global financial system, and James M. Ray of Omnipay, an exchanger for the now defunct digital currency E-gold interjects to share some of his experiences and views on the topic of seeking legitimacy.\nVitalik Buterin: When did you first hear about Bitcoin?\nDoug French: It was earlier this year, or I suppose at some point last year. I stumbled onto it, and mentioned it in an article I wrote for Laissez Faire Books. People seem to be coming down on either one side or the other \u2013 you\u2019re either pro-gold or pro-Bitcoin, but you can\u2019t be both, but you can\u2019t be both, which strikes me as very very odd, and there are fights about whether it can be money.\nVitalik Buterin: The regression theorem?\nDoug French: Yes, they\u2019re throwing out that old canard the regression theorem, and I don\u2019t see how the US dollar or the euro satisfy it, I don\u2019t see Bitcoin following it, but I suppose if you want to flog Bitcoin with the regression theorem and call it a day and not think things through that\u2019s fine, but ultimately we just don\u2019t know, and we leave it to the market. The Hayekian view is that nobody has complete knowledge, and we\u2019ll see what happens, and that was kind of my view. And then Jeffrey Tucker, who I officed with, became interested in Bitcoin. When Jeffrey Tucker becomes interested in anything, it goes from interest to obsession very quickly, so I began to hear about Bitcoin eight to nine hours all day, every day. We\u2019re actually doing a Bitcoin conference on October 5, and it\u2019s very interesting. I think Jeffery\u2019s interest was at the end of last year, start of this year, and he\u2019d give me hourly updates on the price, etc. I think his interest was really spurred up here in New Hampshire when he went to Liberty Forum. He spent some time with the gentlemen making Bitcoin ATMs and other sorts of uses of the technology and somebody gave him a bitcoin and then he became an evangelist for it. He tries to give away bitcoin himself. So we had the incredible spike at 266, then the crash, now it\u2019s settled down, so it\u2019s interesting and I\u2019m fascinated by it.\nVitalik Buterin: In terms of just global finance right now, there\u2019s the US dollar, the Euro crisis which is really still going on, and recently we have the Japanese situation. Which of those three do you think are the biggest deal at this point?\nDoug French: It\u2019s hard to say. There\u2019s this quiet currency war going on that I think all the major currency blocs, if you want to refer to them that way, are involved in. The Japanese are much more overt with the new guy who\u2019s in charge who says he\u2019s going to do this groundbreaking, \u201cwe\u2019ve never done this before\u201d sort of thing, which is ridiculous. They\u2019ve been doing this for two or three decades. Maybe they are going to do a little more of it than they\u2019ve been doing, but it\u2019s been one stimulus program and one quantitative easing round after another. Their central bank goes as far as buying real estate investment trusts and ETFs and so on, so they go beyond even what the Fed does with money created out of nowhere. I would say that he\u2019s certainly been effective with the rhetoric and what he\u2019s done because the yen has dropped like crazy and, what does that do, it makes the dollar look pretty good in a bad neighborhood, and same with the euro. I find it fascinating how the euro is a hot news item in the United States for five business days and then Draghi sticks a band-aid on it, and then, you could almost set your watch by it, it quiets down for six months, and then it pops up again. It\u2019s like the fire here by the BitTent. The fire goes out and then the embers are smoldering and then they get the fire going again. I don\u2019t think Europe\u2019s problems have gone away; they haven\u2019t done anything that would make them go away.\nVitalik Buterin: Their unemployment is record high\u2026\nDoug French: Sure, and yeah, I think it\u2019s a terrible place to be if you\u2019re a young person trying to start a life, start a career, and there are a lot of problems there, and that\u2019s opened the door for Bitcoin, and I think the timing has worked out right for a solution that\u2019s completely outside the state and state control, although now it\u2019s clear that the United States is trying to do all they can to regulate this at least on a payment system basis, and by doing that they may get some kind of control over this thing. Interestingly enough, some people in the Bitcoin community who actually are involved in the use of it and making a living from it are all saying \u201cregulate us, regulate us, give us some legitimacy, we don\u2019t want to be associated with the Bitcoin believers who think Bitcoin will create anarchy next week\u201d and so they\u2019re crying out for regulation whereas the more ideological types want it to remain pure and free.\nVitalik Buterin: Well, I think some of those people would prefer that it remain untouched but they see that organizations like FinCEN are really powerful and they are going to touch them, so they might as well settle down on a framework before those people realize its full impact.\nDoug French: I agree with that. I worked in banking for 20 years, and I know that if they want to regulate you they\u2019re going to track you down and they\u2019re going to regulate you and you\u2019d much rather have a seat at the table during the initial regulation than be on the outside looking in. It\u2019s kind of like being a creditor in bankruptcy court; you\u2019d much rather make a deal out of court than have the judge make a deal for you, so I understand what the industry\u2019s trying to do, it\u2019s just\u2026 I mean, it\u2019s interesting from an observer standpoint to see the sides line up, as we have the ideological folks who are both evangelists for the use and are very quick to throw in the \u201cwe\u2019re going to take down the state with Bitcoin\u201d idea and then the guys who are actually trying to make a living with Bitcoin are saying \u201cFinCEN is trying to get us, let\u2019s link arms are try to make the best deal we can\u201d, so more than anything it\u2019s fascinating to watch.\nAnd it seems to be sort of a young people\u2019s territory. I\u2019m relatively ancient to be having any interest in this, but I gave a talk to a group of certified financial planners in Washington DC of all places, and the talk was really about, in shorthand terms, quantitative easing from John Law to Ben Bernanke, but I wound up my talk with Bitcoin. Essentially, this is how governments have screwed up money for centuries and centuries, and Bitcoin has emerged as a result of that. So I asked this crowd how many had Bitcoin, there were none; I asked them how many of their customers had actually asked about Bitcoin, one person raised their hand, but when I got done, I took questions, and virtually every question was about Bitcoin. So there is very much a fascination with this, and I think it will continue that way.\nVitalik Buterin: I know that whenever Tony Gallippi goes out to payment conferences and makes presentations, he goes out there with more mainstream folks like Stripe and Square and Braintree or whatever, and whenever they present about their various \u201cinnovations\u201d, so to speak, and he presents about Bitcoin and BitPay, all the questions are about Bitcoin.\nJames M. Ray: On what you were saying before about cooperating with regulators versus fighting them, I think recent history might have some good lessons for us. Doug Jackson of E-gold tried very very hard, I witnessed it, I was there, to cooperate with the government, he testified in front of Congress and all the various agencies, but he finally got raided anyway. If they could have raided Bitcoin they already would have, and the meme I\u2019m trying to spread, I would love to see someone like Jeffrey Tucker say it, is that Bitcoin is karma for E-gold. It\u2019s karma for what they did. And karma will come back and bite you in the ass if you\u2019re a government. I should be a rich @!$%= right now instead of a poor @!$%=, but because of their attack on e-gold I\u2019m a poor @!$%=, so I\u2019m kind of emotional about it, you know. I would have been more on the cooperation side, but I\u2019ve seen trying to cooperate and what it does.\nDoug French: No, you\u2019re exactly right, and thanks for interjecting. It\u2019s not like Bitcoin started this, it was actually E-gold, and to some extent Paypal.\nJames M. Ray: And Bernard von Nothaus, e-bullion, Crown Gold, they\u2019ve attacked every honest system. And the first accusations are \u201cwell, the gold\u2019s not there\u201d. People have already tried that trick. The gold not being there wouldn\u2019t have bee fun, you know. E-gold was only going to be fun if it was honest\u2026 it\u2019s a long story.\nDoug French: When you heard Peter Thiel talking about what Paypal is going to be, he was essentially describing Bitcoin.\nJames M. Ray: I spoke to him in Anguilla in 1999 at one of those conferences where you go to a place without an income tax and talk about how you want the world to be that way and he sounded much less like a credit card processor and much more like a payment system.\nDoug French: Yeah, exactly, he gave up and sold out and he\u2019s still a rich guy and that\u2019s great.\nJames M. Ray: I\u2019ll say, Doug Jackson made a variety of mistakes with E-gold, some I went along with and some I was against, but the biggest mistake he made was saying no to Goldman Sachs. Because if we had Goldman Sachs money and Goldman Sachs political backing there is no way E-gold would have ever been attacked. We live in the United States of Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. I mean, it\u2019s not America anymore, it\u2019s bankerism.\nVitalik Buterin: As far as Peter Thiel goes, I wouldn\u2019t say he completely sold out. He still does support things like the Seasteading Institute and-\nDoug French: Yeah, no question about that.\nJames M. Ray: Has any libertarian done anything right with a floating island? What was that place, New Minerva or something, where the guy ended up attacked by Tonga\u2019s military and getting kicked out. It doesn\u2019t seem to work for us.\nVitalik Buterin: Blueseed is starting up right now, it\u2019s got venture capital backing, they were at Bitcoin 2013. Anyway, do you think there is any danger that Bitcoin would suffer the same danger that PayPal has, and essentially just become part of the establishment.\nDoug French: And be just another payment system, yeah, I think these guys run that kind of danger if they link arms too quickly with the government. The ECB wrote a report on Bitcoin just under a year ago, so we\u2019re certainly not flying under the radar anymore. FinCEN\u2019s all over them, and you\u2019ve got the various raids. Any time any of these famous money transmitters gets shut down, I think one of the latest ones was Liberty Reserve, Bitcoin is thrown into the publicity mix even if it wasn\u2019t involved. It\u2019s very easy to do a deal with the devil, but I think they should recognize that the devil is the devil. Maybe they\u2019ll all get rich and live happily ever after and it ends up just like Paypal. It doesn\u2019t mean that the world\u2019s worse off, the world\u2019s probably better off for their entrepreneurial genius, but it\u2019s certainly not what was contemplated by our mystery man who created this thing. So it\u2019ll be interesting to see how it comes out.\nVitalik Buterin: What do you think about gold right now?\nDoug French: Well, I have more gold than I have bitcoin, so that tells you one thing. As far as the price goes, I don\u2019t know, there seems to be great physical demand. The paper price of it has been hammered in some people\u2019s view; it\u2019s interesting, people will say to my wife, \u201cjeez, boy, gold\u2019s really getting hammered\u201d, and she asks \u201creally, what is it?\u201d, and they say \u201c$1300\u2033, so she replies, \u201cwell, I started buying it at $500\u2033, and in that case you don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s been hammered. I point out to her that if you bought at $1900 then it\u2019s been hammered, but markets don\u2019t go straight up and they don\u2019t go straight down. Central banks are doing the best they can to keep pumping air in a tire that has a hole on the other side, and they\u2019re going to keep pumping to keep asset prices high and create employment, which they can\u2019t do, but that\u2019s the only thing they know how to do. Unfortunately for them, money velocity has fallen virtually to zip, and the banking system is broken at least here, and so you don\u2019t have the money creation you would normally get with the central bank tripling its balance sheet. But the sticks are there and they could light on fire very quickly, and it\u2019s very hard to control this thing. Whatever gold I have, I hope I never have to use it and I hope I die with it, but one of these days I may have to pull it out and find my way around. It\u2019s an insurance policy that I think everyone should have.\nJames M. Ray: In view of the LIBOR scandal, do you think it\u2019s possible that central banks are not manipulating the price of gold and silver?\nDoug French: I just don\u2019t give governments that much credit.\nJames M. Ray: You don\u2019t think they could? I mean with all the derivatives out there GATA\u2019s been screaming at it for twelve years, I read all their stuff.\nDoug French: I know, I used to read it, I just don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve heard the GATA guy, Chris Fowl, talk; he was very compelling.\nJames M. Ray: You would think they would go away if they have been refuted but they haven\u2019t.\nDoug French: No, they\u2019ve got their story and they\u2019re sticking to it. And I think there\u2019s probably something to it, but I can\u2019t articulate how it\u2019s done, and it\u2019s hard to imagine that the government can\u2019t deliver the mail but they can guide the price of gold around.\nJames M. Ray: Well, it\u2019s not working perfectly, I mean we\u2019ve seen a rise from $200 to more than $1300, so they\u2019re only able to delay the inevitable I think, but I still think GATA\u2019s right in the end. I\u2019m like you, I\u2019m hanging on to everything I can.\nDoug French: I haven\u2019t bought at these kinds of levels for a long time, I put it away and I forgot where half of it is. And that\u2019s probably the best way.\nVitalik Buterin: How might the banking system be different once Bitcoin gets involved in a more serious way?\nDoug French: I was just thinking about the differences between the banking system in a Bitcoin as oppose to a banking system in a fiat currency world, and one of the advantages of bitcoin is that you can\u2019t have fractional reserve banking. Because when you lend a bitcoin, there\u2019s a title to each and every bitcoin that must be transferred. In the case of fractional reserve banking, people put money in the bank, they retain title to it, but the money is left to someone else, so you have this duplication of money that happens over and over and over again, roughly 10 times over the course of the banking system. That cannot occur in the case of Bitcoin, which I think a lot of people probably don\u2019t realize, and it\u2019s one of the huge advantages to a Bitcoin world. I think people focus too much on the Fed\u2019s ability to create money when it\u2019s the banking system with the cartelization and the backing of the Fed as a lender of last resort that makes that possible. But in a Bitcoin world the actual title must transfer, and so you don\u2019t have money creation happening through Bitcoin like that. Could it be possible to create a derivatives market in Bitcoin where you have essentially synthetic bitcoins created in a loan market? Yeah, probably, and I\u2019m sure financial entrepreneurs could make that happen, but not nearly to the same extent. Right now, we have fractionalized banking with shadow banking on top, so you have layers that the average person really doesn\u2019t understand or even realize. You may have some of that in the Bitcoin world but at least with this inability to duplicate title you nip a lot of that in the bud and this money creation could be stopped.\nVitalik Buterin: Also, in the fiat currency world, why do people deposit money banks? It\u2019s not because they\u2019re chasing the 0.25% interest, it\u2019s because they have to in order to meaningfully participate in the modern economy. Whereas Bitcoin, as a base unit, exists on the internet right from the start. You would only want to participate in a banking system if you are getting a good deal, and if the bank could show you that they are stable.\nDoug French: Right. I think people in the United States haven\u2019t been touched by the banking sector nearly as much as Argentinians or people in other areas in the world that have been just racked by inflation and banking prices throughout probably throughout their whole lifetime. Those people are embracing Bitcoin much more enthusiastically than Americans are, because they realize that an alternative is needed. People in the United States, they grew up with the dollar, they don\u2019t understand the manipulation that is going on, their life hasn\u2019t really bee affected by banking prices, and they\u2019ve never had to shop for bread and watch the price go up as they stand in line as you\u2019ve had in Argentina and Zimbabwe, so it\u2019s interesting that in a number of South American countries and Africa they have embraced Bitcoin. Also, another reason is that in many of these places is credit card transactions. They\u2019re not able to do commerce with credit cards because credit card companies have had so much fraud from these areas that they won\u2019t accept them, but they\u2019ll accept Bitcoin because it\u2019s not a credit transaction, it\u2019s purely a market transaction.\nVitalik Buterin: Bitcoin is growing quite a lot in China recently, At least the part of the Chinese people that are internet-savvy and somewhat wealthy, they understand virtual currency and there is a much stronger desire for freedom there.\nDoug French: And they\u2019re much more distrustful of the government monetary system. I go to Turkey a fair amount, and people store their wealth not in Turkish lira, but in rugs and gold. If you go to the grand bazaar, you can buy gold trinkets of various shapes and sizes and you can buy rugs, and that\u2019s how people store their wealth. Now, in the internet age, not everyone has a TV, but everyone has a phone. So that\u2019s how you can transmit bitcoins, through your phone. That I think is something that Americans really can\u2019t get their hands around, so I think they\u2019re going to be really slow to adopt. In other places in the world, there are people selling property for bitcoins, and there are much more transactions taking place, and I think Americans realize it. As for this stigma that Bitcoin is only used for illegal transactions or something shady, whether it be money laundering or buying drugs or buying prostitutes, I think none of that stuff should be illegal anyway. Government can make anything illegal, and the way they trap people is through not paying their taxes or some kind of money transfer violation, and I think people should probably think about what kinds of things could become illegal, whether buying too much of certain ingredients in too short a period of time, implying that you\u2019re involved in methamphetamine manufacture, and they\u2019re probably going to try to make dealing in bitcoins, through implication, some kind of crime.\nVitalik Buterin: I don\u2019t think they\u2019re actually going to make it a crime. But the thing with how the legal system works is that even being subjected to legal process is itself so burdensome that it constitutes a penalty.\nDoug French: You\u2019re exactly right. People live and fear the IRS for that very reason, just as the whiff of the idea that you could be audited or the whiff of being arrested and having your picture on the front paper is enough to scare most people into toeing the line. Anyway, those are just the things I thought about, and I think the banking issue is important because I think a lot of people don\u2019t realize how fractionalized banking works and how the world would be different with Bitcoin. It would be less inflationary, and less prone to booms in busts. It would be much better.\nVitalik Buterin: Anything else you wanted to talk about?\nDoug French: I would say that I think the Bitcoin detractors miss the point that Bitcoin has a lot in common with gold, the pure mining of it is very similar, it was set up in the same way here it was very easy to get gold in the beginning if you were in the right place at the right time, now it\u2019s harder, it takes rooms full of computer power to create one bitcoin just like it takes one of these shacks of ground to get a gram of gold created. They have a limited supply. I think the guy who really has Bitcoin figure out is probably our common nemesis Paul Krugman. You know, as much as you don\u2019t like to cite him, he kind of understands what Bitcoin is. I personally don\u2019t think deflation is bad, I think deflation is good, it\u2019s bad if you\u2019re a government, a business or individual loaded with debt, but I think for the normal person, to have prices fall with the benefit of technology I think it\u2019s a good thing.\nThis idea that as money goes up in value and goods go down in price nobody will spend money on anything because they\u2019re going to wait for goods to go down further, I don\u2019t know why people don\u2019t just look at the computer industry and realize that people know that there\u2019s going to be a better version of any machine in 3 months, but they\u2019re not going to starve themselves waiting for products to go down in price. People who say that evidently aren\u2019t married. So, deflation is a good thing, again, except if you are massively in debt or you\u2019re a government that want to buy votes and keep the masses happy with bread and circuses. You know, let\u2019s give anarchy a chance, let\u2019s give Bitcoin a chance.", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 20}

The letter alleges that the \u201cBitCoin Foundation\u201d is operating as a money transmitting business without \u201cproper authorization.\u201d It proceeds to threaten \u201cAPPROPRIATE ACTION\u201d if the Foundation fails to \u201cCEASE AND DESIST FROM CONDUCTING THE BUSINESS OF MONEY TRANSMISSION\u201d in the State of California, and requires a response in writing within 20 days. It isn\u2019t clear as to whether the countdown started from the 30 May date, or from the letter was received(the letterhead shows \u201cCERTIFIED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED.\u201d\n\nWhile the letter provides no explanation for how the Foundation can be considered a money transmitter, simply stating that the matter has \u201ccome to the attention of the Commissioner\u201d of the DFI, one possible link is the Bitcoin 2013 convention, organized by the Foundation in San Jose, California on 17-19 May. The letter, dated 30 May, also coincides eerily with a similar notice from the State of Virginia that led Virginia-based Tangible Cryptography to suspend its operation of FastCash4Bitcoins.com.\n\nThe California letter, signed by Paul T. Crayton, Senior Counsel, goes on to list several potential punitive outcomes that could result by non-compliance, including fines and prison time. Curiously, the relevant US Code sections attached to the letter for \u201cconvenient reference\u201d appear to have been sloppily printed off from Cornell University\u2019s legal reference website, complete with sidebar ads asking \u201cDon\u2019t have a CFO?\u201d and another from Google proclaiming \u201cWebsites are now free for California business,\u201d indicating that Google\u2019s location specific advertisement targeting is working just fine.\n\nThere is no indication that any of the Foundations activities meets the California Financial Code\u2019s definition of what constitutes \u201cmoney transmission.\u201d Quoting from the Code, \u201c(o) \u201cMoney transmission\u201d means any of the following: (1) Selling or issuing payment instruments. (2) Selling or issuing stored value. (3) Receiving money for transmission.\u201d Furthermore, the California Financial Code defines \u201cMoney\u201d as a \u201cmeans a medium of exchange that is authorized or adopted by the United States or a foreign government.\u201d The definitions of a \u201cpayment instrument\u201d and a \u201cstored value\u201d are equally applicable to anything the Foundation has indicated involvement with as a non-profit organization.\nWith the rational behind the letter unclear, speculation has run rampant on reddit, bitcointalk, and twitter, with theories about the cause ranging from the fact that bitcoin ATM\u2019s were operating at Bitcoin 2013, to a larger, systematic attack on bitcoin.

Gox has experienced rising volumes of deposits and withdrawals from established and upcoming markets interested in Bitcoin. This increased volume has made it difficult for our bank to process the transactions smoothly and within a timely manner, which has created unnecessary delays for our global customers. This is especially so for those in the United States who are requesting wire transfer withdrawals from their accounts.\nWe are currently making improvements to process withdrawals of United States Dollar (USD) denominations, and as a result are temporarily suspending cash withdrawals of USD for the next two weeks.\nPlease be reassured that USD deposits and transfers to Mt. Gox will remain unaffected, as will deposits and withdrawals in other currencies, and we will be resuming USD withdrawals once the process is completed.\nWe apologize for any inconvenience this causes our U.S. customers in the meantime, and look forward to resuming withdrawal service as well as debuting a dramatically improved trading engine which will be launching very soon.\nRegards Mt.Gox Co.

Gox serves as the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin exchange and as of July 2011 has managed over 80% of Bitcoin trade. Founded in 2009 and operated by Japanese company Tibanne Ltc., Mt. Gox is registered by the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce. A surprise to many, the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin exchange stands for, \u201cMagic: The Gathering Online Exchange.\u201d Despite it\u2019s original purpose of exchange of Magic: The Gathering playing cards, Mt. Gox now is a force to be reckoned with in the Bitcoin community.\nFrom yesterday\u2019s press release, Mt. Gox leadership highlight that the temporary halt is intended to provide room for system improvements. Despite the clear inconvenience for Bitcoin users within the United States, one might see this as a positive sign as Mt. Gox has received an increased volume of deposits and withdrawals. There is evidently a growing interest in the Bitcoin currency and Mt. Gox\u2019s system must be strengthened to handle the increased volume of money wires to and from the US. Additionally, with the May closure of the Dwolla account on Mt. Gox by the US Department of Homeland Security, Mt. Gox has dealt with an increased number of wire transfers to and from the US.\nAfter a day of uncertainty for US Bitcoin users, Mt. Gox posted on Bitcoin Reddit and elaborated a bit on the purpose of the halt. Mt. Gox stated, \u201cWe are now working with new banks and alternative methods for transmitting money to our customers,\u201d and \u201cevery customer\u2019s funds are safe, sound, and accounted for.\u201d\nWhat does this mean for the Bitcoin community in the US? Bitcoin users will need to find other exchanges and possibly rely more heavily on peer to peer interaction. In essence, during this timeframe, Mt. Gox will attempt to improve the USD withdrawal transaction system. The halt is expected to continue for about two weeks and during that time Mt. Gox will continue to authorize withdrawals and deposits in other denominations. Time will tell, whether or not Mt. Gox will maintain its position of prominence in the Bitcoin community, but to date the the Tokyo based exchange still maintains a position of prominence.", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 22}
{"title": "Bitcoin at Porcfest, Part 5: Conclusion", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-at-porcfest-part-5-conclusion-1372040904/", "birthday": "Jun 23, 2013  10:28 PM EST", "date": "2013-06-24 03:28:00", "content": "By the end of the Porcfest, it has become clear that Bitcoin has become a standard tool in the libertarian\u2019s toolbox. Over the course of six days and dozens of presentations, Bitcoin has been mentioned more often than even old stalwarts like gold, silver, cryptography, jury nullification and the second amendment. The majority of stores have come to accept it, and the efficiency of Bitcoin transactions has been steadily improving over the course of the week as merchants and consumers alike have gotten better at using Bitcoin wallets. With the exception of about twelve hours of partial downtime on Friday, Lamassu\u2019s Bitcoin-only wifi worked successfully all throughout the week, although sometimes more slowly than expected. The Bitcoin price itself has been remarkably stable throughout the event, arguably breaking out of a medium-term downtrend and holding steady at $100-$113.\nOne of the greatest problems that Bitcoin adoption has been facing to date is that adoption was simply too sparse for any kind of Bitcoin economy to be practical. Some merchants could be convinced to accept it, but by and large Bitcoin has only been able to grow through a small number of disparate online retailers accepting it on the internet. Furthermore, many of these retailers were only willing to accept Bitcoin because BitPay allowed them to immediately, and cheaply, convert any bitcoins that they receive to cash, so Bitcoin\u2019s key advantage, its ability to bypass the inefficiencies of the traditional banking system, never existed in practice. It has always been a commonly held position that in order for Bitcoin to truly grow it would need to form a closed-loop, or at least multi-step, economy; that is, instead of a customer buying BTC from Coinbase, sending it to the merchant and the merchant having the bitcoins converted back through BitPay, there should be at least one step in between of someone earning bitcoins in order to spend them.\nOver the past two years, such a thing has started to happen all on its own. BitPay\u2019s Tony Gallippi reported that merchants tend to initially take the \u201csafe\u201d option of immediately converting all bitcoins that they receive, but eventually moving over to keeping a growing part of their earnings. Lamassu\u2019s Josh and Zach Harvey are among the many Bitcoin fans that have convinced some of their own suppliers and contractors to take BTC, and almost certainly at least one of them is using some of the bitcoins to shop at Bitcoin-accepting stores.\nWhat has just taken place at Porcfest, however, shows a completely different path that Bitcoin can take to success: take over an entire community. Communities are defined as groups of people that interact with each other much more often than with the general population; local towns and villages, schools, large workplaces and internet forums all to some extent constitute communities. If people in a community interact by buying and selling goods and services, as opposed to just talking (as happens with many internet communities, for example), then introducing Bitcoin to that community is a very efficient way of generating that multi-step, or possibly even closed-loop, economy all at once.\nNow, consider what has been happening in the libertarian movement in the past few years alone. First, the Free State Project has grown from a few thousand members to over fourteen thousand, just six thousand away from \u201ctriggering the move\u201d \u2013 the point where, once the project has gathered twenty thousand members, everyone who signed up is expected to move to New Hampshire at the same time, potentially exerting an entire 2% influence over the vote of the entire state. Precious metals guru Doug Casey has set up La Cafayate de Estancia, an intentional community in Argentina, and at Porcfest the anarchist and Bitcoin entrepreneur Jeff Berwick has announced his intent to do the same, although with a more expansive aim, in the nearby and, by South American standards, very business-friendly Chile. Peter Thiel has donated $1.25 million to the Seasteading Institute, a group involved in research and promotion efforts in creating self-sustaining communities floating on the sea, and some in the institute have since split off to create Blueseed, a business seeking to actually do just that off the coast of Silicon Valley in 2014, and at the Bitcoin conference in San Jose Edan Yago announced the existence of a semi-secret project to create \u201cthe world\u2019s first cryptocurrency-based political zone\u201d \u2013 in short, the Hong Kong of the Americas with a Bitcoin twist. The fact that these communities are just beginning to surge into the mainstream at the exact time that Bitcoin needs them most seems like nothing short of a match made in heaven.\nIt is crucially important to point out that the concept of intentional communities is not new, and is not even usually libertarian. Many of the original settlements in the New World first started out as fleets of pilgrims seeking escape from persecution and the opportunity to pursue what they saw as a new way of life. In the early 20th century, Israeli kibbutzim emerged, serving as collective communities based on agriculture. The entire concept of utopian socialism, an 18th and 19th-century school of thought that heavily influenced philosophers like Karl Marx, has given rise to hundreds of intentional communities around the world; some form of collectivism remains the dominant ideology of intentional communities today.\nA related concept is \u201cphyles\u201d, a more modern concept of intentional community promoted by writers and philosophers such as Doug Casey, David de Ugarte and Neal Stephenson, that combines online and offline aspects, operating on a global scale while providing real-world services to its members. Phyles are not new; perhaps the single most successful one in history is in fact the Catholic Church. However, the growth of the internet has given the idea of phyles a unique opportunity for a sudden, and hyper-digitized, resurgence. And in these phyles Bitcoin has the chance to take on a crucial role. Bitcoin is arguably the only financial medium that can be used both internationally and in person. Cash is limited to one nation, and credit cards require too much infrastructure on the merchant side to be useful in person, leaving Bitcoin as a unique alternative ideally suited for the present, and future, phyles of the 21st century. One deliberate attempt to create a phyle, Stan Stalnaker\u2019s Hub Culture, has already announced its intent to work with Bitcoin with its combined Ven-Bitcoin digital currency fund.\nTargeting the intentional community movement, including phyles and secessionist groups like the Free State Project, will by no means be the key to Bitcoin\u2019s sudden and massive success. The mainstream is far from accepting such ideas, and barring outright monetary collapse there is no clear and realistic roadmap that will lead to the general public embracing any alternative to having most services provided by traditional corporations and states in the next decade. Aside from that small percentage of the population that is naturally geared toward being early adopters, social progress is necessarily cumbersome and slow. However, the fact that Bitcoin\u2019s superior efficiency is only truly realized in the context of a closed-loop economy, combined with its unique status as both an effective local currency and what may well be the world\u2019s first truly transactional one, is clear evidence that the two movements can benefit greatly from working together in the decades to come. After the Bitcoin conference in 2013, which some activists in radical organizations like unSYSTEM have denounced as excessively corporate and capitulationist, many are desperately searching for a way to reclaim the currency\u2019s idealism. This is it.", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 24}

{"title": "Solving the Slow In-Person Transaction Problem", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/solving-the-slow-inperson-transaction-problem-1372210181/", "birthday": "Jun 25, 2013  9:29 PM EST", "date": "2013-06-26 02:29:00", "content": "One of the crucial features for a digital transaction medium to be viable for payments made in person is that it should be reliable, and nearly instant. A transaction, once created by the sender, should appear on the receiver\u2019s device within one to three seconds. Even five seconds may be acceptable, but from the point of view of an average user requiring a customer and merchant to awkwardly wait for fifteen seconds while a transaction makes its way over the network is an embarrassment \u2013 especially when competing platforms like Square can accomplish the same (albeit without Bitcoin\u2019s low fees and universality) in less than three. And yet, in practice, that is all too often the state of in-person Bitcoin transactions right now. A transaction sent with Blockchain may take as long as twenty seconds to reach a nearby client running Bitcoin Wallet for Android and if the transaction is non-standard in certain ways (eg. by not having a fee) it can take several minutes or even hours to show.\nTo understand why this happens, it is first important to understand the most common case in which it does not happen: when the sender and receiver are both blockchain.info. Blockchain.info differs from other popular wallets, like Bitcoin Wallet for Android, in that it is semi-centralized; although blockchain.info is still using the same, decentralized, underlying Bitcoin protocol as everyone else, the wallets themselves send and receive transactions from the rest of the world through blockchain.info\u2019s centralized servers. The transactions are all immediately rebroadcast to the Bitcoin network, so this makes no difference in the long term, but in the short term this provides a significant advantage. If the sender and receiver are both using blockchain.info wallets, the transaction only needs to make two hops: sender, blockchain.info, receiver. The blockchain.info server stores all transactions that are legal under the protocol, so even transactions with dust outputs, or without fees, are relayed to the receiver without problems.\nIf one of the two is using something else for a wallet, however, then the situation gets more complicated. The transaction needs to make many hops through the Bitcoin network, and be validated each time, in order to reach the receiver. There is also another complication. The bitcoind client, responsible for the vast majority of the Bitcoin network, enforces some rules on what transactions it is willing to relay (for example, transactions spending newly received coins must have at least a very small fee), and if a transaction violates any of these rules propagation time through the Bitcoin network slows to a crawl. Even if a transaction does not violate any of these rules, it often takes as much as ten seconds to get through.\nSo what are the consequences of this? Essentially, centralized wallet services may, to a small extent, become their own walled gardens \u2013 that is to say, balkanization. Sending bitcoins from blockchain.info to blockchain.info is instant, as is Bitcoin Spinner to Bitcoin Spinner, but sending from blockchain.info to Coinbase is more difficult. The problem with walled gardens, however, is the old adage called Metcalfe\u2019s Law: \u201cthe value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of users\u201d. If blockchain.info has 50% of the mobile wallet market and Bitcoin Spinner has 10%, then blockchain.info is not just better than Bitcoin Spinner because of whatever features drive five times as many users to its service in the first place; it is also better because it offers instant transactions to a larger number of users. It is clear how this naturally leads to monopoly.\nOne solution to the problem involves an optional layer of centralization. Blockchain.info offers a page, blockchain.info/pushtx, where anyone can submit a transaction into blockchain.info\u2019s servers; the first step is that all other centralized wallet providers, and Bitcoin network information sites, should do the same. Second, centralized services should agree to either push all transactions to each other deliberately, perhaps through specialized channels, or even co-locate servers in the same data center. Finally, decentralized wallets should automatically push all transactions to these transaction submission hotspots at the same time as releasing them to the network. This does not compromise Bitcoin in any way; all of the old infrastructure remains in place, so a non-participating wallet will still be at least as fast, if not faster, than before. Rather, it adds an optional \u201cclearing\u201d layer to help transactions move through faster.\nAnother solution is to add more information into payment requests. Currently, merchant platforms and Bitcoin wallets can typically only generate QR codes with two pieces of data: the Bitcoin address to pay to and the amount to pay. Consider what would happen if the protocol were to add a third piece of data: the receiving wallet\u2019s IP address. Then, when the sender scans the QR code and pays, the wallet could send the transaction to the sender directly. If the receiver has no publicly reachable IP address (eg. the address is masked by NAT), a Bitcoin client that does have a publicly reachable IP address can be used to act as a go-between. In this case, the transaction would take one or two hops to reach the receiver \u2013 as fast as with blockchain.info to blockchain.info transactions in the worst case, and even faster in the best case.\nWhichever solution we will take, some kind of optimizations to make Bitcoin faster are necessary. Companies like Square are spending millions of dollars shaving hundreds of milliseconds off their transaction time to make the user experience more pleasant. Tech enthusiasts may be happy to withstand the struggles of slow and unreliable transactions for the sake of a cool new technology, but one average users enter the picture it is small optimizations like those that make all the difference. Bitcoin itself is just on the cusp of moving from the tech enthusiast crowd to the first signs of general usage, and so now is the time for us to start taking these finer points of ease of use seriously. The other solution, for the Bitcoin community to simply say \u201cthis is one of the faults of a decentralized system, deal with it\u201d, is no longer acceptable.", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 26}

For those who have not seen Bitcointip used before, the process is simple: deposit money into your account, and then to tip a particular user (eg. myself, \u201cvbuterin\u201d), you write \u201c+tip 0.01 BTC vbuterin\u201d into a comment anywhere on Reddit. Writing \u201c+tip 0.01 BTC\u201d sends the tip to the creator of the comment that you are replying to. You can also denominate tips in fiat currencies like USD and EUR, \u201cinternets\u201d (+1 internets = 0.25 USD) and \u201cpoints to Hupplepuff\u201d. The idea proved to be a hugely successful one, and is processing tens of thousands of dollars every month.\nNow, Pikapay\u2019s Richard Kohl and Joris Bontje are trying to accomplish the same thing on a platform that is even more widely used than Reddit: Twitter. Pikapay seeks to allow anyone to send bitcoins to any other Twitter user through its Twitter-integrated interface. It will also be possible to withdraw the bitcoins to a Bitcoin address or convert them to fiat currency, but these features will be developed in cooperation with PikaPay\u2019s partners and are not included in the public beta. But PikaPay also has one feature that Bitcointip does not: you can request money. Requests can be directed at a particular person, or at a number of your followers; the latter feature is especially interesting, as using it celebrities can potentially crowd-fund charitable contributions from all of their followers at the click of a button. However, the simple payment option itself should not be discounted; as founder Richard Kohl pointed out, even his grandmother could use it.\nThe bot is still in public beta, so although, as mentioned above, not all features are yet operational, the service is rapidly improving. Sending works perfectly, and requesting is also operational, albeit with some glitches as of the time of this writing. The rest of the features should come online very soon. Bitcoin users interested in Twitter should also check out Brian Santos\u2019 UpTweet, a platform that integrates Twitter, a blog/forum hybrid and Bitcoin micropayments. In the meantime, Pikapay\u2019s Richard Kohl and Joris Bontje has agreed to answer many of our questions in an interview:\n1. When did you first come up with the idea to create PikaPay? What was your inspiration?\nJoris Bontje: The inspiration for PikaPay was the search for a way to make Bitcoin safe, easy and fun for anyone to use. I was a developer for the I2P project to create a better communication network when I first heard about Bitcoin in 2010. With many years as a software developer for some of Europe\u2019s largest banks, I saw an opportunity for our team to build a platform to make Bitcoin accessible to the rest of the world and help define the future of digital transactions. Twitter and its familiar 140-characters is considered one the world\u2019s leading platforms for communicating to individuals on a worldwide level. Important causes and global brands use Twitter, why not Bitcoin?\nIn June 2011 I had built and launched the first Bitcoin to Twitter service called PayBitBack, which was very successful. But we wanted to build something better than a wallet or tip jar. During the two years we spent to develop PikaPay, we\u2019ve had contributors from 17 different countries, from Bolivia to India, and they all helped us look at Bitcoin and financial transactions from a global perspective.\n2. What are you trying to accomplish with PikaPay? What is the project\u2019s main purpose?\nRichard Kohl: We created PikaPay to help solve two of the problems with Bitcoin that people complain about most. One is that there really aren\u2019t enough uses for bitcoins. Two is that Bitcoin suffers from a P.R. and trust problem.\nThe popularity of Bitcoin will grow as it becomes a safe, easy and social way to transact. For it to catch on it must be as familiar and as easy as cash. It also has to be secure. PikaPay is safe and easy enough to send bitcoins to your neighbor or your aunt. I recently sent some to my 96-year-old grandmother. She now might be one of the oldest people in the world to hold bitcoins.\n3. What are some examples of things that can be done with PikaPay that would not be possible just using Bitcoin by itself?\nPikaPay was designed to be as close to cash at a distance as possible. We\u2019ve removed a lot of the friction still associated with Bitcoin. Some examples:\nPikaPay is all about the mass adoption of Bitcoin. You can now transact in Bitcoin with the millions of people and organizations on Twitter.You can combine the familiar 140-character Tweet with a Bitcoin transaction.PikaPay transactions are nearly instantaneous, so you do not have to wait for any confirmations.A buyer and seller do not have to exchange any non-public information about themselves in order to make a transaction.Twitter Names are always public, so I don\u2019t even need to ask for your E-mail address or scan your QR.Handling a local wallet and Bitcoin addresses is simply out of reach for most of the world.PikaPay can be used easily by anyone on PC or mobile device. You don\u2019t have to install anything or think about devices getting hacked or stolen.\n4. I noticed that PikaPay has a feature that lets you \u201crequest\u201d payments, including requesting payments from the first N followers.What are some of the ways that you expect that feature will be used?\nThe request feature can be used as a digital invoice. You send it discreetly via Twitter Direct message to anyone who is following you. You can also use it to announce special deals to your Twitter followers or to announce discounts or left-in-stock promotions: \u201cI\u2019m selling tickets for $5 to the first 10 followers.\u201d We hear about people planning to do Twitter Crowdfunding with Bitcoin. Right now you can announce any project or good cause, and ask your followers to pay via the special link that PikaPay sends with each request.\n5. What is your strategy going to be for getting PikaPay out there and making sure the masses find out about it?\nWe\u2019ll be making some special announcements about this in the coming weeks. Early responses have been very positive. Right now we have a team of ambassadors who have volunteered to help spread the word, and we\u2019re ready to talk to people with good ideas about how to take it further.\nWe\u2019re adding intelligence to PikaPay based on cues given from Twitter\u2019s social graph. The more people who use PikaPay and help spread the word, the smarter PikaPay will be at finding the next wave of Bitcoin adopters.\n6. Do you see Twitter in general as becoming a more important social media platform in the future? Why or why not?\nAs an innovator and trend-setter Twitter seems to be hitting its stride globally, not just with many more users, but many more active international ones.There are many ingredients that have contributed to this growth, but the fact that this application started it\u2019s life as a mobile first platform, as PikaPay has done, has definitely played a big role.\n7. What other trends in social networking do you think are going to become important in the next few years? How do you see Pikapay fitting into this future?\nJust as it has for many other segments of the world economy, social media is going to play a critical role in building influence and trustwithin the new Bitcoin economy \u2014 Trust between Bitcoin users themselves, between Bitcoin merchants and consumers and then from the rest of the world in Bitcoin as a technology, as a movement and as a brand.\nTwitter already plays a central role in building trust. Twitter Tweets and hash tags continue to make headlines beyond Twitter and are just beginning to extend their reach into other media around the world. You can already see Twitter at the heart of a lot of the major changes taking place in the world in recent years \u2014 in important causes and campaigns, in new kinds of businesses and even in revolutions which have been launched and sustained with Twitter. We built PikaPay to enable them.\nWe like the possibilities of real-time responsiveness of Twitter coupled with the micropayment services of our API. We\u2019re looking at investing time, money and resources into developers who understand what this means and have good ideas on how to leverage it.", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 26}

How to get your way, by giving in.\nCompliance regimes, by their nature are the auditing to a standard and the enforcement of rules of governance in a regulated environment. Compliance regimes will be found wherever there has been a third party harmed by activity outside of their control. Sometimes they are also found where businesses have attempted to erect barriers to entry into a market and have successfully lobbied for controls which they satisfy but may cause difficulty to smaller competition. There are compliance regimes for vast numbers of regulated industries. If your industry is considered important, it is likely regulated.\nOn an individual level, there are also extensive compliance regimes. One that has been hotly debated in the news lately is the US Internal Revenue Service. This service serves each income earner in the US and many abroad. They provide very prompt and attentive service on an individual basis. It is this service that of all the US Federal services, has the most intimate relationship with the citizenry and it is projected that this intimacy will get much much deeper in the near future as it takes charge of not just your personal wealth, but also your health as it is the government institution charged with implementing the new federal health insurance payment requirements.\nIn the mean time, by the time you read this journal, you may have lost half your wealth to this service without even knowing it. How? We have a little known but highly important tax filing date on June 30 2013. The FBAR (Foreign Bank and Financial Account Report) form is available from the IRS. This form is required for all that have foreign accounts with an aggregate value of US$10,000 or more. The reason this may come as a surprise is that foreign banks and exchanges do not need to report this, only the account holder does.\nNormally this may be a quiet non-event for most, because the well heeled folks with Suisse Bank holdings and gold vault troves, or Cayman Island accounts have staff that will perform such things on their behalf to maintain their compliance. Why this year is different is that there is a growing phenomenon which I have written about recently called crypto-currency, such as Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a virtual currency, it is not legal tender in any country, and it has no inherent value. In this way it might be similar to a currency in an online game, where you can trade virtual gold with a digital Elf for a virtual item that lets you play better in some online game. It has no value outside the small world of folks that want to play that game. But where Bitcoin is very different from these other virtual currencies is that it has an exchange value. Folks have been exchanging this virtual currency for dollars and yen and euros and all sorts of other government currencies. There are currency exchanges that are permanently operating that give a real-time value for these virtual currencies. (Yes currencies\u2026 there are many, not just Bitcoin, though that is currently the most valuable and noteworthy of them all).\nSo what is the connection? Compliance \u2013 FBAR \u2013 Bitcoin? Quite simply, since the regulatory environment in the USA is fairly ornate, many of the Bitcoin businesses are hosted overseas. The largest Bitcoin exchange is in Japan, MtGox.com. Since all of these are online businesses, it is not always obvious where they are located, but if you have accounts on several of the exchanges, and the aggregate value of all those accounts is over US$10K, you are required to report it to the IRS. This is true even if you have never exchanged any of this virtual currency for \u201creal\u201d money of any kind, because the exchanges list a \u201cvalue\u201d of the currency in US Dollars.\nAt this time quite a high percentage of the Bitcoin folks are unaccustomed to having large amounts of money. Most are technology folks, programmers, or working people. This is because it still takes some technical know-how to work with this currency. It exists in software, it uses cryptography, it is experimental and not much like any currency that has ever existed before. These folks are not the highly tax-savvy 1%ers that file these forms routinely. A few years ago, the currency was worth ten cents, then a dollar, then ten dollars, now it is about 100 dollars apiece, and briefly this year it went up to 265 dollars, and it hit a high of almost 32 dollars in 2011.\nSo this could be a big problem for US Bitcoin holders. The FBAR non-filing penalties from the IRS are draconian. Willful non-filing for violations occurring after October 22, 2004, the ceiling is the greater of $100,000 or 50% of the balance in the account at the time of the violation. This means that someone that had over 300 of these virtual coins as far back as 2011 could have their whole virtual fortune sacrificed to the IRS simply for not filling out the form. The penalty would then be 50% + 50% = 100% of the entire amount of your account, regardless of whether it was profitable or not, simply for holding the account outside the US and not reporting it. The IRS confirms this:\nQ. Can cumulative FBAR penalties exceed the amount in a taxpayer\u2019s foreign accounts? A. Yes, under the penalty provisions found in 31 U.S.C. 5314(a)(5), it is possible to assert civil penalties for FBAR violations in amounts that exceed the balance in the foreign financial account.\nTo add to this problem, there is no notice that you will receive that you need to file this form until it is way past too late. The IRS will not notify you, the foreign institution has no requirement to notify you. The only way you are going to find out is by reading important journals such as this, or Forbes or some other financial journal that serves the international community. You will also not receive any notice that the form was received, you have to call the IRS (866-270-0733) to confirm that it was received and have to wait 90 days to do so. Even if you file, and it was lost in the mail, you may lose your entire foreign fortune, so it is important to make that call.\nSo how can you be sure whether you need to file? The safest way is to ask your tax attorney and read carefully the IRS documentation. 1. In order to determine whether or not the FBAR is required, all of the following must apply: A. The filer is a U.S. person; (or person equivalent, partnership, corp, etc) B. The U.S. person has a financial account(s); C. The financial account is in a foreign country; D. The U.S. person has a financial interest in the account or signature or other authority over the foreign financial account; and, (you have the password) E. The aggregate amount(s) in the account(s) valued in dollars exceed $10,000 at any time during the calendar year. The US government has shown that it is taking Bitcoin very seriously so we should be wise and understand the implications of that. Either avoid it altogether, risk your entire fortune and freedom by pretending that you can be anonymous, or understand it well enough so that you don\u2019t fall in one of the many pitfalls that may accompany this wonderful new world of virtual money.", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 26}
{"title": "Coinsetter: Will a Better Virtual Currency Make Bitcoin Obsolete?", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/coinsetter-will-a-better-virtual-currency-make-bitcoin-obsolete-1372295494/", "birthday": "Jun 26, 2013  9:11 PM EST", "date": "2013-06-27 02:11:00", "content": "Building my first startup in the highly competitive online ticketing industry taught me a lot about who wins and loses in a changing environment. Many people in the tech world suggest that all you need to do in order to attract customers is to build a great product and users will naturally come. While building a great product is vital, it\u2019s not the whole story. All around us, we see large, imperfect companies dominating their market while new entrants with theoretically better products never quite gain traction. Many entrepreneurs rely upon this \u201ccreate a better product\u201d strategy and never understand why users aren\u2019t willing to leave their old product for the shiny new thing. With many people questioning if Bitcoin is the best implementation of virtual currency, I can already see parallels in comparing Bitcoin with other options. The answer to whether Bitcoin is the long term winner in this race is actually quite clear.\nFirst, most people would admit that Bitcoin is not perfect. The 10 minute confirmation time is not optimal for quick transactions. The 51% attack is still a looming risk. Then there\u2019s the huge amount of energy \u201cwasted\u201d in the mining process \u2013 not great from an environmental standpoint. I\u2019m not the first person to point these issues out, and in response, many people have already released other virtual currencies that aim to improve upon the movement that Bitcoin has started. Litecoin, Ripple, PPCoin, Feathercoin, BBQcoin and others all claim to be a better virtual currency, and their proponents are just waiting for bitcoiners to flock over. BBQcoin is obviously the most delicious of the virtual currencies and way more delicious than Bitcoin, but what would need to happen for it to truly rival Bitcoin?\nI think it helps to take a step back and ask why a lot of Bitcoin\u2019s imperfections exist in the first place. These imperfections were not oversights by its core developers; they were expected byproducts of thoughtful decisions that they made. For instance, the 51% attack is only possible because of the extremely distributed nature of the mining structure that makes Bitcoin unstoppable by groups that would limit it. A system like Ripple reduces this particular risk and uses far less energy in the process, but by using trusted gateways as the basis for making confirmations, it is prone to government manipulation. Though I believe Ripple as a technology is needed and will be successful, I see its form inevitably becoming influenced by the government. Bitcoin companies will have to play ball with regulation, but the currency itself will hold its ability to force desired change in world.\nBeyond imperfections, Bitcoin has an attribute that will solidify its place as the only viable virtual currency: Bitcoin\u2019s use as an IP address for money. While closed payment networks will initially be apprehensive to accept Bitcoin transfers, they will find that they must accept out-of-network Bitcoin transfers or become obsolete. Within the next five years, almost all closed payment networks will have an input for your Bitcoin address, turning them into open payment networks that can accept money from anyone. However, you won\u2019t find two inputs on these apps for your Bitcoin and Litecoin address. Bitcoin is the only virtual currency that has sufficient adoption to become the standard. If you want to know how this story unfolds, I encourage you to read the history of the Internet and TCP/IP.\nFurther solidifying Bitcoin as the only viable virtual currency, wider adoption will lead to increased switching costs. Once a company, product or in this case, a currency takes dominance in an industry, people don\u2019t tend to leave it for something with low value improvements. This happens, firstly, because people find comfort in familiar things and don\u2019t become compelled to try something new unless the benefit is overwhelmingly obvious. Bitcoin already has far wider adoption than any of its alternatives and has substantially more infrastructure being built around it. Second is track record. For as bad as a product is perceived to be, proven \u201cgood enough\u201d reliability goes a long way against unproven alternatives. Bitcoin\u2019s four years of success in the face of hackers and growing transaction volumes builds confidence. Finally, Bitcoin has very social roots. Given the value now associated with the word \u201cBitcoin,\u201d it is very unlikely that another virtual currency will match its cach\u00e9 in the next five years.\nSo will a better virtual currency make Bitcoin obsolete? The answer is very clear to me. Bitcoin isn\u2019t perfect, but it doesn\u2019t have to be in order to fend off competitors and remain the world\u2019s dominant virtual currency. An understanding of this notion presents an opportunity for people that understand it today. Until traders widely realize that Bitcoin is here for good, there will be a lot of untapped value in Bitcoin\u2019s market price. The currency\u2019s longevity will become obvious over time and be reflected in prices down the road, so eat your BBQcoins, sell your PPcoins, and go buy some Bitcoins before they\u2019re back at $200!\nAbout the Author\nJaron Lukasiewicz is the CEO and Founder of Coinsetter, a New York City-based company that offers a high performance levered trading platform for Bitcoin.

In Europe, Germany in particular stands out as an area for much growth and potential for the Bitcoin community. On Saturday, June 29, Platoon Kunsthalle, will launch a Bitcoin Exchange in Berlin, Germany. Localbitcoins.com has joined forces with Platoon Kunsthalle to reach out to the Bitcoin community in Berlin, Europe, and around the world.\nThe event will begin at 4:30 pm CET with an introductory talk about the Bitcoin currency. Following the discussion of Bitcoin and opportunities within the community, attendees will have an opportunity to sell and purchase Bitcoins with one another. Bitcoin Exchange Berlin was founded by Aaron Koenig, Bitcoin Mount Knox blog. Bitcoin Magazine had a chance to interview Aaron Koenig and learn more about why he chose to spearhead Bitcoin Exchange Berlin and his involvement in the Bitcoin currency.\nBitcoin Magazine: When did you first get involved in the Bitcoin currency?\nAaron Koenig: I first read and blogged about it in the summer of 2011. In the autumn of 2011 we accepted Bitcoin as payment for our libertarian magazine BLINK which also covered Bitcoin. In 2012 we produced an animated film for Bitcoin Germany.\nBM: What was it about Bitcoin that you found interesting?\nAK: I had studied the Austrian School of economics and their criticism of the Fiat Money system before, and when I stumbled across Bitcoin I thought: this is it! This is what Friedrich August von Hayek meant when he talked about the denationalization of money and the free competition of currencies.\nBM: When did you start to develop the plan for Bitcoin Exchange Berlin?\nAK: I met Joshua Rossi at the Bitcoin Conference in California in May, and I was fascinated about the live exchange he organizes in New York. So I asked him if we may organize a similar thing in Berlin, and he immediately agreed. We do some things differently, for instance we don\u2019t do it open air, but in a closed venue, which makes sense in the rather rainy weather of Germany. We are very happy with our venue Platoon, which is an art space made out of cargo containers. They have an established base of followers, which makes it much easier for us to spread the word.\nBM: Where do you see Bitcoin Exchange Berlin going in a year?\nAK: We don\u2019t plan so far ahead. We definitely want to see more events of this kind in all major cities, so that Bitcoins become easily available everywhere. So hopefully BXB will be just one node of a huge network of live exchanges.\nBM: What makes Bitcoin Exchange Berlin stand out in comparison to other products within the Bitcoin community?\nAK: You can\u2019t compare BXB to an online exchange, it is not a business, more of a fun event to make Bitcoin accessible to everyone. We play a lot with old fashioned props. Our sellers write their prices with chalk on small blackboards and they wear bowler hats, City of London style.\nBM: What is the overarching goal and purpose of Bitcoin Exchange Berlin?\nAK: We want to lower the entry barrier, so that normal people, who would not use an online exchange, get in touch with Bitcoin easily. Once they get familiar with it, they might want to use a service like Localbitcoins.com, too, where they can make individual appointments with traders.\nBM: What are your recommendations for individuals looking to get involved in projects similar to yours?\nAK: Just do it. Bitcoin is great, it should be used everywhere and for every purpose. The more Bitcoin projects there are, the better.\nBM: Can you highlight the development of the Bitcoin community in Berlin and Germany as a whole?\nAK: More and more people in Germany know that the Euro system will inevitably collapse, so they want to be prepared for what comes next. Germans are especially sensitive, as we went through two major monetary disasters in the last century, and the Euro will surely be the next one. So many people now think about getting their savings into gold, silver and Bitcoin.\nPlatoon Kunsthalle is an ideal site for the Bitcoin Exchange Berlin as it serves as a communication consultancy specializing in mobilizing cultural movements and community events. Platoon Kunsthalle has a facility in Berlin and one in Seoul to foster relationships between artistic and creative subcultures and brands. Individuals can join the Platoon Network to utilize the Platoon Kunsthalle experimental space to host workshops, display art projects, and present creative initiatives which often clash with more traditional art institutions but highlight development of global movements. The Bitcoin currency is certainly a global movement centered upon ingenuity and peer to peer interaction.\nBitcoin Magazine encourages you to attend the launch of the first Bitcoin Exchange Berlin (BXB) in Saturday, June 29!

In the announcement, which was mirrored on FastCash4Bitcoins, the company cited communication they received from the Commonwealth (State) of Virginia on Friday, 31 May, as cause for the shutdown, which occurred the same day. According to Tangible Cryptography, a complaint had been received by the Commonwealth of Virginia State Corporation Commission alleging that the company had been acting as an \u201cunlicensed money transmitter.\u201d\nThis comes despite having promoted their service as not engaging in activities requiring a money transmitter license. FC4B allows its customers to sell bitcoins directly to Tangible Cryptography, with no third party involvement. Users had the choice of PayPal, Dwolla, ACH Bank Deposit, or Bank Wire Transfer for sales payment. This allowed FC4B to advertise that since they were a direct buyer of bitcoins, they did not need to meet the same regulatory standards that would be required of an exchange.\nHowever, according to the announcement, a preliminary investigation conducted by the Corporation Commission concluded that FC4B\u2019s business may fall into money transmitter territory. Under the complaint process in Virginia, Tangible Cryptography has 30 days from when notice was given to provide a written response to the commission detailing why their business does not require a money transmitter license. The notice from the state commission specifically alleges that FC4B is \u201cissuing bitcoins,\u201d which it implies may meet the standard for a \u201cstored value.\u201d FinCEN defines a Stored Value as \u201cFunds or monetary value represented in digital electronics format,\u201d which leaves the question of whether or not Bitcoin is a \u201cfund or monetary value\u201d muddled by FinCEN\u2019s recent guidance on virtual currencies, which made a point of contrasting \u201cvirtual\u201d currencies with \u201creal\u201d currencies.\nThe two pertinent points in this case are first, whether the company is indeed \u201cissuing\u201d bitcoins, and second, if Bitcoin can be considered a stored value. Both requirements would need to be met in order for Tangible Cryptography to legally be required to be licensed as a money transmitter. FinCEN\u2019s March guidance fails to specifically deal with the unique situation Tangible Cryptography finds itself in. Under the section dealing with \u201cDe-Centralized Virtual Currencies,\u201d it is noted that businesses providing a third-party intermediary service for customers buying and selling virtual currency must obtain money transmitter licenses. Notably absent is the business model that Tangible Cryptography instituted, that of directly buying a virtual currency with no middleman involvement.\nTangible Cryptography may have been a victim of its own attempts to over-comply with perceived existing and future regulation. Tangible Cryptography, LLC was registered with FinCEN as a Money Services Business on 20 March, 2013. The FinCEN database lists \u201cMoney transmitter\u201d as the MSB activity connected with the registration. Thus, it is possible that by registering as an MSB when it may not have needed to, Tangible confused state regulators into thinking that it also needed the state money transmitter license which it did not have, needlessly bringing this regulatory action onto itself. While the announcement indicates that a complaint was the beginning of Tangible\u2019s current woes, the possibility of extraneous compliance with regulation that may not apply to a particular business is another potential pitfall that new Bitcoin-related financial businesses may need to contemplate.\n", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 3}

Another digital payment network, Liberty Reserve, was shut down by federal investigators, and the government specifically mentioned the service\u2019s anonymity as a major reason behind the shutdown. However, judging by the price the community has proven to be surprisingly resilient. Bitcoin dropped 7.5% during the month, but the entire drop and more took place during the initial days of the month following the Coinlab suit. Since then, it recovered from a low of $79 and now stands at $117. A major piece of positive news driving the comeback was a series of investments from Silicon Valley, and A hugely successful Bitcoin conference, with over a thousand people attending, bolstered the community\u2019s spirits and sent the world a clear message: Bitcoin is here to stay.\nFor those interested specifically in the Bitcoin conference, you can find our full collection of articles on the topic here.\nThe Regulators Are Moving In\nCoinlab, a company that had signed an agreement with Mt. Gox in February to take over the exchange\u2019s operations in North America, turned against its former partner with a $75 million lawsuit on May 2. Coinlab claims that Mt. Gox has failed to uphold a single one of its contractual promises to assist the company with the migration, and has violated its agreement to discontinue serving customers in North America itself (whether this was actually part of the agreement as written is one of the questions in dispute).Mt. Gox\u2019s Dwolla account in the United States was frozen by the Department of Homeland security, with the DHS claiming that Mt. Gox was acting as a money transmitter without applying for a money services business (MSB) license from FINCEN, the US money transmission regulator. According to the DHS warrant, Mt. Gox (specifically, its US subsidiary Mutum Sigillum LLC) also falsely claimed that they were not going to be involved in money transmission when signing up for their bank account in 2011.SatoshiDice started blocking US-based IP addresses, citing legal worries.Liberty Reserve was shut down by US regulators and its operators criminally charged, with Liberty Reserve\u2019s anonymity being cited as a major reason behind the investigation and shutdown.After some Bitcoin users became worried that Bitcoin would be next, FINCEN followed up with an interview where chief Jennifer Calvery clarified that \u201cthat action was against one financial institution and one type of financial service\u201d and \u201cexchange providers that comply with the law [ie. the FINCEN guidance] have nothing to fear from Treasury.\u201dIn Canada, the regulators are taking a different path. The Canadian money transmission regulator, FINTRAC, sent a letter to Bitcoin exchanges saying that the exchanges are \u201cnot, at this time, engaged as a money services business in Canada\u201d, and therefore \u201cdo not have to register your entity with us.\u201dBitInstant told Bitcoin Magazine that they now have money transmitter licenses in 30 states \u2013 suggesting that the task of getting fully licensed is not quite so daunting as was originally thought.OKPay reduced the scope of its operations in the Bitcoin community to only processing payments for verified merchants, citing legal concerns to explain the decision\nThe Silicon Valley\u2019s Embrace\nCoinbase received $5 million of investment mainly from the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Union Square Ventures, with additional support from Ribbit Capital, SV Angel and Founders Club.The Boost VC accelerator program announced that it would be investing an additional $50,000 into every Bitcoin company in the next group of startups that they would be working with starting June 24.BitPay raised $2 million from the Founders Fund, of which Peter Thiel is one of the two founding members.BitInstant announced that it has raised $1.5 million from Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (best known for their role in founding Facebook). The two brothers also appeared as keynote speakers at the Bitcoin conference in San Jose.A new, Bitcoin-specific, venture capital group, BitAngels, was created at the Bitcoin conference, attracting 60 investors and raising a total of $6.7 million in capital.\nBusiness and Charity Adoption\nBitPremier, a marketplace for luxury products and real estate targeting wealthy Bitcoin users, opened its doors on May 2.ASICMiner started selling its Block Erupter USB mining products, offering 336 MH/s for 1.99 BTC, and the company is continuing to sell its Block Erupter Blade devices with 10 GH/s for 49.99 BTC. The company\u2019s valuation also crossed $100 million, making it the most highly valued \u201cpublicly traded\u201d company in Bitcoin history.Gyft, a mobile gift card platform that offers digital gift cards for 50,000 physical retail locations across the United States, started accepting bitcoins.The Electronic Frontier Foundation began once again accepting Bitcoin donations. When the EFF stopped accepting Bitcoin in June 2011, the organization donated their 3505 BTC of existing donations to the Bitcoin Faucet run by lead Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen. Now, Gavin returned the remaining 726 BTC from that fund to the EFF, which are now worth more than the 3505 BTC were when the EFF turned them away in 2011.The Free State Project-affiliated medical group Fr33Aid announced that the organization is now using Bitcoin as its main currency.The money transfer system WebMoney added a new unit to its repertoire of digital currencies, WMX, representing bitcoins, allowing Bitcoin users to buy WMX which can then be converted to other WebMoney currencies to purchase products at many merchants worldwide.Unterkunft.de, a website for renting living accomodations in Germany, started accepting Bitcoin payments.The Bitcoin payment processor BitPay passed 7000 merchants.Second-tier Bitcoin exchanges like BitStamp saw a considerable increase in volume relative to the dominant exchange Mt. Gox, with BitStamp on some days seeing up to half the volume of its main competitor.\nBitcoin Wallets Galore\nBitcoin 0.8.2 was released, reducing the fee needed for small-value transactions to get fast confirmations from 0.0005 BTC to 0.0001 BTC. BitcoinQt and bitcoind clients will now also enforce a minimum transaction output size of 0.0000543 BTC (optionally changeable with a custom setting).CarbonWallet, an Electrum-compatible, browser-based Bitcoin wallet saw its first release.RushWallet, an improved version of the now-defunct InstaWallet that works without the site\u2019s operators ever finding out their users\u2019 URLs (and therefore private keys), also opened itself up to public use.Conformal, a company focused on building open-source software for privacy and security, revealed their latest project: btcd, an alternative Bitcoin implementation written in the Google-developed programming language Go.libbitcoin, another alternative Bitcoin implementation in C++ targeting asynchronicity and modularity, released a tutorial.", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 3}

BEP was founded by Charles Hoskinson earlier this year to reduce the knowledge barriers to entry for individuals to enter the world of Bitcoin, and to highlight Bitcoin\u2019s utility in mainstream activities. BEP holds to six key tenets of objectivity, transparency, accuracy, accountability, inclusion, and honesty. The project also works to achieve the following three goals: to eliminate misinformation about Bitcoin, generate and vet content made by members of the Bitcoin community, educate to add 1 million additional Bitcoin users to the Bitcoin ecosystem by 2014.\nThis past month BEP also began a new partnership with Udemy to bridge the information gap and eliminate misinformation about the Bitcoin currency. While this digital, decentralized, cryptocurrency is growing in prominence, education is still a necessity so those involved in and interested in the currency have an understanding of the fundamental purposes and principles behind Bitcoin. Udemy, an online learning platform allowing instructors to host courses, is known as \u201cThe Academy of You\u201d. Launched in 2010, Udemy is now mainstream with over 7,000 premium and free courses and the opportunity for instructors to craft their own courses. Udemy permits instructors to upload videos, PDFs, audio, zip files, PowerPoint presentations, and facilitates online discussions.\nThrough its partnership with Udemy, BEP now offers 7 introductory lectures on the Bitcoin currency, lectures on Bitcoin wallets, Satoshi Nakamoto, and bonus lectures on cryptography with additional lectures and insight from BEP Senior Fellows such as Jon Matonis. With many lectures to come and an open forum for Bitcoin community members to request additional insight on issues of significance, BEP has tremendous growth opportunity within the Udemy space.\nThe Bitcoin Education Project is another step in the right direction for the facilitation of information sharing within the Bitcoin community and the process of educating individuals eager to learn more. As we continue to expand and will be publishing our 1 year anniversary issue soon, we at the Bitcoin Magazine look forward to working with the Bitcoin Education Project to bridge the information gap and draw practical connections between daily life experiences and the Bitcoin currency.\nIf you would like to contribute your expertise to Bitcoin Magazine and the Bitcoin Education Project, please let us know! We need to continually keep the community updated and seek to spread the word on the applicability of Bitcoin to everyday life.\n\n", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 3}

Sign up is simple, and includes a refreshingly legible CAPTCHA. The website also provides a discussion forum with sections for The Bitcoin Forum, Bitcoin Ideas, Development & Technical Discussion, and Project Development.\nThe database is searchable by keyword (although this feature appears to be only available in the mobile version at this time), as well as country, category and region. While sparse on listings as of this writing, (searches for \u201cfood,\u201d \u201ccupcakes,\u201d \u201calpaca,\u201d and \u201csocks\u201d returned no results) the service appears to be intuitively designed for ease of use. Like other Bitcoin service listings, The Bitcoin Search Engine appears to be waiting for user generated data to catch on, while distinguishing itself for style and presentation.

{"title": "Has The Fall of MtGox Already Begun?", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/has-the-fall-of-mtgox-already-begun-1369965091/", "birthday": "May 30, 2013  9:51 PM EST", "date": "2013-05-31 02:51:00", "content": "MtGox has suffered considerably over the past two months. All within the relatively short period of April and May 2013, we have seen the following:\nDuring the Bitcoin crash of April 10-12, MtGox saw its trading engine lag increase to over 70 minutes, and for over ten hours the exchange was almost entirely inaccessible. MtGox\u2019s response was mixed; at first, they committed what may go down as one of the major public relations disasters in Bitcoin history, telling angry customers that they were \u201cvictims of our own success!\u201d and gloating about their high trade volume. Then, however, the exchange did take significant steps to improve its transparency.On April 17, MtGox took away the ability to place orders without having the underlying funds already in one\u2019s account. Such a feature may seem counterproductive, but it is very useful for traders who, for example, wish to place a buy order at $120 and a sell order at $140 in order to profit on, and simultaneously help relieve, price volatility. It was also essentially the only advantage that MtGox\u2019s actual trading system had over its major competitors.On May 2, MtGox\u2019s partner Coinlab sued them for failing to follow through on their agreement to transfer control over US operations to Coinlab and (whether or not the agreement actually requires this next part is not entirely clear) cease operations in the US themselves. The amount claimed: $75 million.On May 16, MtGox lost their Dwolla account due to a failure to take even the simple step of registering as a money services business with FINCEN. It was also uncovered that the company may have knowingly made false statements on their bank application in 2011; most believe that it is as a result of this that MtGox CEO Mark Karpeles was forced to cancel his trip to the Bitcoin Conference in San Jose.On May 25, MtGox lost a second deposit and withdrawal partner, Liberty Reserve.On May 27, MtGox lost a third partner, OKPay.\nTough luck even for such a juggernaut as MtGox. However, even at the middle of the month it appeared as though MtGox was breezing through its difficulties; by May 16, its share of the past 30 days\u2019 volume nevertheless remained at over 75%. But since that day, MtGox\u2019s fortunes have taken a darker turn.\nThis chart shows the trade volume of MtGox and BitStamp, now the second most popular exchange in the world:\n\nBitStamp has grown slightly over the period, but what we can clearly see is that volume on MtGox has decreased by a large amount. A large portion of this is undoubtedly market conditions; low volume is characteristic of price stability. However, the increased difficulty of dealing with MtGox following its banking and regulatory debacles also played a part; it is the reason why the Bitcoin price on MtGox is now 2-3% higher than on BitStamp and other exchanges \u2013 it\u2019s not that BTC is more expensive in one place than another, it\u2019s that people no longer treat 1 MtGox USD as being actually necessarily worth 1 USD. This is a pretty serious loss of trust; in similar cases in history involving governments and banks, once the ball starts rolling in such a crisis of confidence it is very difficult to get it to stop.\nAnother, more telling, way of looking at the trend is through the graph of BitStamp trade as a percentage of that on MtGox:\n\nOn some days, BitStamp is now as much as half as large as its competitor. Many people have been talking about replacing MtGox since 2011, and for a time there was some hope in 2012, but now, taking together the fact of MtGox\u2019s recent misfortunes and the evidence of Bitcoin\u2019s rapid growth in the past two weeks, it appears that it\u2019s actually happening. The long stalemate of late 2012-2013, where BitStamp, BTC-E and to a lesser extent BTCChina all had about 10% of MtGox\u2019s volume for many months, is finally broken, with BitStamp surging clearly ahead.\nFrom here, things can happen quickly. Much of MtGox\u2019s volume is through a small number of what are essentially resellers; an entire one third, for example, belongs to BitInstant.\u00a0These companies can switch to using BitStamp, or Tradehill, at a moment\u2019s notice \u2013 BitInstant is even close to having the needed money transmitter licenses to become a Bitcoin exchange in their own right (although they may not want to do that for technical reasons). Also, users follow liquidity, and liquidity follows users, creating a vicious (or virtuous) cycle that may reverse the current MtGox near-monopoly far faster than a monopoly can fall almost anywhere else; for many users, switching costs between the various exchanges are essentially zero. My warning to BitStamp: you may now be on the cusp of not just growing to be an equal competitor to MtGox, but taking over first place outright. Get better servers, get better lawyers, and double or triple your support and compliance staff now; do not follow the mistakes of Coinbase and MtGox and let trading outages or month-long verification queues tarnish your path to greatness.", "year": 2013, "month": 5, "day": 31}

Technology Review wrote that Bitcoin is now growing \"in a manner disappointing to some early enthusiasts\" now that Bitcoin exchanges are eager to work hard on achieving regulatory compliance. Laissez Faire Books' Jeffrey Tucker wrote a long plea arguing against \"regulating Bitcoin like dollars\", and on June 2 CNBC followed up with the most alarmist article of all: according to them, Bitcoin is \"sacrificing its soul to survive\" the regulatory onslaught.\nHowever, what all of these journalists have somehow completely failed to realize is that the talk about whether or not Bitcoin will be \"regulated\" completely misses the point. First of all, all of the regulation in question is currently completely targeted not on internal Bitcoin businesses, but on Bitcoin exchanges - that is to say, the intersection between Bitcoin and fiat currency, which is heavily regulated already. The closest that any government so far has come to regulating actual Bitcoin services is the half-hearted SEC investigation of pirateat40's Ponzi scheme in 2012. Second, and much more importantly, Bitcoin is not, and never was intended to be, a clever legal scheme for evading regulations by virtue of not being classified as a fiat currency. The idea that regulators would simply sit back and allow such a loophole to continue to exist and simply nullify their regulatory agendas is highly naive wishful thinking at best.\nRather, the reason why so-called crypto-libertarians are attracted to Bitcoin so much is that much of it is unregulable on a practical level. True, in order to get bitcoins through an exchange you will need to give up identifying information and satisfy exchanges' KYC policies, but once you're in the Bitcoin system you're all clear. Blockchain.info offers a mixing service that lets you trade your bitcoins for \"anonymized\" bitcoins at a 0.5% fee, deleting all records of the transaction 8 hours after the fact, and one can also take advantage of Silk Road's mixer by simply depositing and withdrawing into Silk Road. While blockchain.info can be legally compromised, good luck subpoenaing \"Dread Pirate Roberts\". One can even use more ordinary Bitcoin services that offer accounts as unintentional mixers by simply depositing and withdrawing from them; between actual mixers and such makeshift constructions one can do as much mixing as one's paranoia demands. At the Bitcoin conference, two separate ideas were presented for decentralized mixers, allowing users to anonymize their bitcoins without trusting anyone at all. Thus, the potential to preserve one's anonymity by using Bitcoin remains completely intact, and no regulation short of banning Bitcoin outright will change this. Coinlab's attempts to create a legitimate front for Bitcoin do not in any way hinder the activities of drug users on Silk Road, and the activities of Silk Road need not interfere with exchanges' and regulators' efforts to promote more universally agreeable uses of digital currency.\nIf you are a regulator reading this article, the question you may be asking is, why shouldn't I be worried? One answer is, although it can be very hard to detect specific activity within the Bitcoin system, moving large quantities of money out of Bitcoin undetected remains very difficult. If you sell the bitcoins at an exchange, the transaction will get recorded. If you use them directly to buy anything of very high value (eg. a car or house), that will also get recorded. Thus, while Bitcoin certainly does empower the small-time drug user buying $50 worth of marijuana on Silk Road, large-scale financial movements will remain easy to detect, and even anonymizing mixers get less effective the more money you try to put through them. Moving large quantities of money into Bitcoin is similarly difficult.\nThe second answer is a more pragmatic one. While the Bitcoin economy itself has grown by a factor of ten since last year, Silk Road, judging by the number of posts on its forum, has only doubled in size. This is similar to the growth of the internet; in 1995, scaremongering about the massive growth in online child pornography was all the rage. Now, however, we realize that as technologies mature more mainstream uses naturally take over, and the prosperity that resulted from having a platform for free and open worldwide communication may have done more to fight child pornography than stricter prohibition ever could.\nThis brings me to the next point: Bitcoin is not like Liberty Reserve. While FinCEN may or may not be correct in its pronouncement that Liberty Reserve was \"mostly\" used for criminal activity, Bitcoin has a number of positive attributes that Liberty Reserve does not. Liberty Reserve was a truly convoluted system to use, with users needing to go through a system of \"exchangers\" in order to get in or out, each one of which took up to a 5% fee. LR itself took a further 1% fee for transactions. Aside from its anonymity, the only redeeming trait that Liberty Reserve had was its lack of chargebacks, making it useful for a limited set of industries such as multi-level marketing. Bitcoin is completely different. Aside from its more controversial privacy properties, Bitcoin lets anyone send money from anywhere to anywhere in the world with minimal (often zero) fees. It is nearly instant, and is in many cases much easier to use than more traditional banking systems. It's also very easy to develop software for, since all of the algorithms are open source and require no registration with any particular third parties (although there are third party services that can help).\n Given all of these properties, there is no way to make a digital currency that does NOT offer some way of providing anonymity; if you make a digital payment system that allows users to construct cryptographically signed transactions, it will necessarily be possible for users to anonymously come together over an internet forum and apply the decentralized mixer protocol to it. And even without fancy cryptography, if a currency is international it will necessarily be possible for someone to set up an anonymous mixer in a jurisdiction that has different ideas about the correct balance between privacy and regulatory interests (especially when \"taxes\" paid directly to particularly malleable government officials are involved). \nGovernment regulators like FinCEN have been notably quiet on Bitcoin itself lately. The FinCEN guidance in March 2013 mentioned decentralized virtual currencies, exchanges and even mining, but took great care never once to utter the word Bitcoin. The government spokesman discussing the Liberty Reserve shutdown similarly avoided mentioning Bitcoin itself, even when asked a question specifically about it. This suggests one likely conclusion: regulators are well-aware of the fundamental impossibility of fully regulating sufficiently advanced digital currency systems that was described in this article, and are treading carefully to take a pragmatic, watchful approach to see just how much information they can gather.\n Under this interpretation, FinCEN undersecretary David Cohen, when stating that \"exchange providers that comply with the law have nothing to fear from Treasury\", was speaking the truth. At this point, it is highly unlikely that mainstream Bitcoin exchanges will be struck down by state departments because they do not yet have quite all forty eight state money transmitter licenses needed to comply with the guidance; FinCEN knows that Bitcoin exchanges exist, and if they wanted to use this avenue to take Bitcoin exchanges down they could have done so a month ago. Bitcoin-based online stock exchanges and gambling platforms may be a future target; SatoshiDice did feel the need to block US users several weeks ago. As for Silk Road, for all the talk of Bitcoin \"losing\" its anonymity, every single Silk Road-related arrest to date has involved either buyers reselling drugs to too many people in physical space or searches and seizures within the postal system. The regulators are fine, Bitcoin is fine, and the future of crypto-libertarianism is fine. Stop worrying.", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 4}

After working in investment banking and private equity for four years, I left my cushy 9-to-5 day job to risk my life savings and focus on a tech startup, which eventually led to me creating Coinsetter. When I started the company, Bitcoin was at $10 and most of my friends thought I was crazy. Conversations about my \u201cjob\u201d got awkward. But six months later, most of you have made a larger return in Bitcoin than my friends in real estate will see in 30 years. And the best part of it all is that the future of Bitcoin has never been brighter for entrepreneurs, investors and traders!The first half of 2013 has been equally rocky as it has been inspiring. For me personally, amazing people who barely knew me took a chance on me by investing in my company, and a growing number of investors are doing the same for Bitcoin entrepreneurs around the world. This can happen to you too! Whether you are entering the space as an entrepreneur or not, Bitcoin is clearly on the rise. The currency\u2019s ability to fit the different needs of an increasingly diverse group of users worldwide is astonishing. More and more people are beginning to see Bitcoin\u2019s value, but the best part is that still so few people know about it right now. Bitcoin is about to explode further over the next 18 months, but I believe a few things need to happen first.Let\u2019s start by addressing the elephant in the room: Mt. Gox. It\u2019s impossible to say right now if the company will fix their ever-growing list of problems, but one can\u2019t deny that they are currently the deepest source of liquidity in the Bitcoin market. While many other exchanges have claimed that their platform substantially outperforms Mt. Gox, none have really been put to the test. Traders are having a hard time leaving their immense liquidity on Mt. Gox for another exchange that might turn out to be just as packed with technical issues. Our company, Coinsetter, is working to provide a solution that gives traders the best of both worlds. Rather than being an exchange ourselves, we are an exchange aggregator (the Wall Street term for this is an \u201cECN\u201d) that allows traders to access the best prices on multiple exchanges, meaning they can keep their Mt. Gox liquidity while adding additional liquidity from more reliable orderbooks. We have multiple developers with deep Wall Street experience building Coinsetter\u2019s platform, which itself operates on the millisecond level. We feel our trading solution can bring stability to the Bitcoin market through exchange aggregation, responsible shorting capabilities, low latency and an overall great customer experience. For us, offering a quality product that focuses on the customer is everything.As better Bitcoin exchange and trading platforms enter the market, more liquidity will follow. Serious traders are having a difficult time building sizeable businesses around an exchange with uncertain latency intervals, but that will change as the market becomes filled with more exchanges and brokerage platforms that can support large trading volumes, as well as high frequency trading. Bitcoin in many ways is still not taken seriously by much of Wall Street, but there is a small segment of the industry that finds it attractive. Not just attractive, they view it as a potential gold mine. We\u2019re in constant conversations with many of these traders, and active trading by this \u201csmall\u201d segment alone is powerful enough to bring Bitcoin from $2 billion to $5 billion in aggregate value. The larger hedge funds will join the bandwagon after that.Trading is great, but it can\u2019t be everything Bitcoin is used for. More businesses that provide Bitcoin payment solutions need to come online to support higher valuations for the currency. Bitcoin is already useful for high ticket purchases, and integration with mobile and online payment apps over the coming two years will bring Bitcoin to the next level of justifiable intrinsic value. The person accepting Bitcoin for an online payment doesn\u2019t even need to be the person who values Bitcoin as a long term storage of value to make this work (even though they should be!) In addition to more payment options, we also need to see truly large amounts of money flowing into Bitcoin, which right now means greater demand as an asset class by the wealthy worldwide. The Bitcoin Fund\u2019s success shows that this is already happening, but we need to see high net worth individuals\u2019 demand for Bitcoin grow by at least ten fold. The wealthy are dabbling in Bitcoin at the moment, and once they have confidence that the Bitcoin industry\u2019s infrastructure is solid, their gigantic demand for Bitcoin will be transformational.A few other problems revolving around Bitcoin need to be solved as well. Lots of discussion is going into solving the 51% attack, and I see real solutions being implemented over the next 12 months. Even more pressing are banking and regulatory issues. The biggest bottleneck to money flowing into Bitcoin is the banking system\u2019s apprehension of working with Bitcoin companies. This will be solved over time, but it will only come once trust regarding AML practices and greater regulatory comfort around Bitcoin in general is established. As for regulation, it\u2019s hard to predict when various regulatory bodies aside from FinCEN will issue guidance on requirements for Bitcoin companies, but one should note that regulation has come surprisingly fast thus far. Because regulatory preparation and compliance is so costly, Bitcoin is quickly becoming a capital-intensive industry.I\u2019ll delve further into many of these topics in future articles. For the time being, I hope to have conveyed the positive future for Bitcoin that I see so vividly. Progress towards this end is already happening, and now is the time to actively become part of it. Don\u2019t stall, and have the confidence to make big moves.\nAbout the Author", "year": 2013, "month": 5, "day": 31}

Gox, OKPAY Play Regulatory Catch-up", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/mt-gox-okpay-play-regulatory-catch-up-1370463046/", "birthday": "Jun 5, 2013  4:10 PM EST", "date": "2013-06-05 21:10:00", "content": "In an apparent bid to keep pace with the regulatory restrictions surrounding Bitcoin, Mt. Gox released a statement on 30 May announcing their customers must now have their identities verified if they wish to withdraw or deposit \u201ccurrency,\u201d with the announcement differentiating \u201ccurrency\u201d from bitcoin. Users of the Tokyo, Japan based exchange may continue to make bitcoin deposits and withdrawals without having their identity linked with their account.\nIn the same vein, ecommerce payment processor OKPAY announced an end to its vacation from bitcoin and reintroduced the cryptocurrency into its payment ecosystem, albeit with more severe restrictions than had previously been in place. As of this writing, the date stamp on the announcement page had not been updated from their previous release announcing their suspension of bitcoin, leading to potential confusion as to when they had announced what. Citing unspecified \u201crisks and dangers,\u201d and alluding to Anti Money Laundering (AML) laws, OKPAY now disallows transfers from any exchange service dealing in bitcoin. Bitcoin service is now restricted only to verified users who have submitted proof of identity.\nMt. Gox had announced OKPAY\u2019s separation (pdf) from the exchange on 28 May, and OKPAY appears to have finalized a divorce for the two services. Following on the heels of the internationally coordinated shutdown of alternative online currency provider Liberty Reserve for failing to meet AML restrictions related to \u201cKnow Your Customer\u201d laws, among other issues, the timing of Mt. Gox\u2019s new rules may indicate an attempt to stay one step ahead of a similar fate. Mt. Gox\u2019s 30 May announcement referenced evolving regulations and AML rules as a background for the new account restrictions. Mt. Gox recently ran afoul of FinCEN requirements through subsidiary company Mutum Sigillum LLC for failing to appropriately register as a money services business, resulting in a court-ordered freeze of Mutum Sigillum\u2019s financial accounts.\nOKPAY\u2019s reintroduction statement implies that by specifically excluding any new business from bitcoin exchanges, they may have been worried that any business with Mt. Gox\u2019s unverified customers would subject them to the same legal hammer swung by law enforcement at its counterparts in the financial payment world. These developments indicate an understanding in the ecurrency community that business dealing in cryptocurrency specifically, and online payments in general, will either rapidly adapt to regulatory structure or face grinding legal headaches at best, and potential fines and incarceration at worst.\n", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 5}
{"title": "BTCGlobal: Commoditizing The Bitcoin Exchange", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/btcglobal-commoditizing-the-bitcoin-exchange-1370675734/", "birthday": "Jun 8, 2013  3:15 AM EST", "date": "2013-06-08 08:15:00", "content": "As Coinsetter CEO Jaron Lukasiewicz pointed out in his letter last week, Bitcoin exchange is rapidly becoming a capital-intensive industry. On a technical level, Bitcoin exchanges are under constant attack by sophisticated hacking attempts and increasingly powerful DDOS attacks to the point that it is becoming impossible to survive without a dedicated, locally hosted server and Cloudflare protection. From a banking standpoint, relatively easy deposit and withdrawal solutions like Liberty Reserve, OKPay and Dwolla have all fallen by the wayside, forcing exchanges to either step up their efforts on banking integration or fall away. And, finally, the worst hit of all is regulatory: since the FINCEN guidance released in March, it has become clear that exchanges operating in the US need to pay a minimum of about $100,000 per year for surety bonds as well as having comprehensive anti-money-laundering policies, and in the last month the US government has struck hard against services like Liberty Reserve and MtGox that it believes are not meeting the requirements. Although the big exchanges, including Coinlab, Coinbase and Tradehill, appear to be well on their way to full compliance, an increasing prevalent worry is, will any future exchange be able to get over the hump?\nBTCGlobal has come up with an innovative solution that just might shift the tide significantly back in favor of the little guy. BTCGlobal\u2019s plan, which the company entitles \u201cMassive Parallel Licensing\u201c, is essentially a franchise: BTCGlobal will pool together resources from any upstart exchanges that want to be partners, secure the necessary money transmitter licenses and surety bonds, and allow its partners to operate under its umbrella. In addition to this formal legal relationship, BTCGlobal will also share its expertise on implementing the anti-money laundering programs that money transmitter laws require. The program goes beyond just this; on a technical level, BTCGlobal will make available BTCUy, its powerful trading engine which can handle 300,000 transactions per second (to compare, MtGox crashed in April because its trading engine was limited to 37 transactions per second, and the Bitcoin network itself averages about 0.7 per second). Speed is not the only advantage of having one commonly developed platform; it will also improve security, as BTCUy is much less likely to have a vulnerability due to amateur coding or security setup.\nThe main question is, just how effective will this franchise be? In theory, the project certainly will massively reduce startup costs from a technical and regulatory standpoint, leaving the individual exchanges to focus on the very thing that Bitcoin exchanges currently need to focus on the most: convenient, easy-to-use deposit and withdrawal options. On the other hand, the legal umbrella concept may turn out to be fragile. The major reason why some banks and established money transmitters are currently scared of dealing with Bitcoin exchanges is that they fear losing their own banking or money transmitter licenses if the partner turns out to have inadequate anti-money-laundering policies; here, similarly the onus is on BTCGlobal to make sure that each and every one of their franchisees remains compliant. Given that the question of just how strict anti-money-laundering policies need to be is still a grey area, this may become a point of contention down the line.\nIf BTCGlobal succeeds, we can expect to see a diaspora of local Bitcoin exchanges appear targeting very specific banking systems or even individual cities, making buying and selling bitcoins much easier. If it does not, then the Bitcoin exchange industry will still progress, but with Silicon Valley investors as necessary gatekeepers as new exchanges struggle to raise the necessary capital for money transmitter licensing. Alternatively, Bitcoin exchange may increasingly go decentralized, with Bitcoin communities in many major cities gaining the critical mass to support in-person trade on localbitcoins. Finally, it is important to keep in mind that the United States is not the only end goal for Bitcoin. It is certainly important, especially since legacy banking systems in the country tend to be much less efficient than their counterparts in Europe, but entrepreneurs thinking of creating Bitcoin exchanges should well consider serving the markets in Europe and Canada instead; laws in both countries are much less restrictive, with the Canadian FINTRAC even explicitly stating that Bitcoin exchanges in the country do not need a money transmitter license. On the whole, developments like this are increasingly making it clear that the Bitcoin exchange industry in all parts of the world has both the will and the capability to meet the challenges of a regulated financial world; it is up to all of us to help it prosper.", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 8}

It stinks of penny-stock or fraud or both. It screams to any sane investor that they should run in the other direction.Luckily I was not one of those.Trusting my gut \u2013 and in the process throwing out the window nearly every piece of investing advice I had ever learned \u2013 I bought.\nBuying was not as simple a task as I had hoped.On the day I read Tyler\u2019s post, the Bitcoin-US Dollar exchange rate (BTCUSD) closed at the price of $1.7949.Four weeks later, after jumping through half-a-dozen hoops to get cash onto Mt. Gox, Bitcoin\u2019s oldest exchange, the price had more than tripled.I held my nose and bought in for an average price of $6.3308. During that waiting period I learned an invaluable lesson: the majority of speculators had recently discovered Bitcoin and were struggling to move deposits to purchase it.Each day I checked Google Trend data for Bitcoin related search terms and saw the network effect of an infectious idea at work. In a scarce liquidity environment, media attention pushed price and the price in turn drew new eyes to this grand experiment.A week later my roommate at the time \u2013 then a trader at another bulge-bracket firm \u2013 joined the fray.$8.$10.$15.We were flabbergasted by our good fortune.Convinced we had boarded a rocketship of a bubble, we settled on an exit strategy.\nOn Friday July 8th, 2011 the market looked grossly overheated as it broke $30 and liquidity had become dangerously one-sided. My roommate called this the top.I on the other hand had let my emotions get the best of me.I was leaving that afternoon for a four-day vacation where I would not have access to the internet or my cell phone.When I returned to land of the internet that next Wednesday, I coolly checked the level of BTCUSD.$21.Not awful.Taking a closer look at the chart, I saw that heavy selling over the weekend had knocked the price down to $10.25.I know a dead cat bounce when I see one.I hit every bid I could find to close out my position and I was gone.\nIn the aftermath of the bubble of 2011, I resolved to steady my thinking on this newfangled currency.Whether or not Bitcoin would survive, I could not tell, but Satoshi Nakamoto had opened Pandora\u2019s box.There was no putting it back.\nVirtual currencies have tremendous potential to reshape our world\u2019s political and economic landscape. To Bitcoin\u2019s naysayers I urge them to take a look at the lessons we can draw from this innovative new stuff.The technology behind the Bitcoin protocol alone could dramatically transform clearing and settlement processes for established financial products.There is much work to be done and the financial community is just beginning to take notice. So too are the regulators.Regulation of virtual currencies in the United States is well underway with FinCEN giving its first guidance on the subject in March of this year.Even under this purview there is room for Bitcoin to survive and thrive. In the long run I welcome this oversight.With the support of venture capital funding, the second generation of Bitcoin start ups are putting down roots.More importantly it appears that many of them will be compliant with US regulation and law by FinCEN\u2019s deadline in mid-September.Wall Street would be wise to pay attention.\nIn the coming weeks I will be writing about Bitcoin and the broader virtual currency space with the established financial community in mind.Topics will include:\n\ntrading strategy and best execution\nmarket structure and exchange topology\nasset management and portfolio diversification\nthe state of regulation within the United States and abroad\nnew technologies in clearing, settlement, and custodial services\n\nIf you have any suggestions or requests, I am all ears.Please drop me a line. In addition to writing, I provide consulting services on the topics listed above.If you think I can help advance your virtual currency related project or investment goals, I would be more than happy to chat with you.I look forward to your readership and the great discussions it will drive.\nHappy Trading,\nJonathan Silverman\njon@thestandardbit.com\njsilverman38@bloomberg.net", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 6}

The Bitcoin community is at a crux and education is needed to push Bitcoin to an even higher level of prominence. How could anyone turn down Bitcoin after understanding the convenience and utility of this currency? Beyond facilitating financial transactions, the Bitcoin currency exemplifies free market ideals and limited government principles which prompt economic and societal success in local, state, and national governments.\nAs some still hold to the misperception that Bitcoin only benefits a select few or is only of interest to those in the software development community, an increased number of Bitcoin Evangelists have emerged to share of the benefits of this innovative currency to all people. One of the main forces in getting the word out is Bitcoin Reddit. Reddit, founded in 2005, touts itself as being, \u201cthe front page of the internet.\u201d Bitcoin Reddit provides an open forum for users to post articles of importance and comment to foster a discussion within the Bitcoin community. Along the same lines as Bitcoin Reddit, the Bitcoin Forum creates discussions based around particular areas of significance in the Bitcoin community such as development and technical issues, mining, technical support, economics, trading, politics and society, and international discussion boards.\nIndividuals are also stepping out to share their thoughts on the validity of the Bitcoin currency through blog sites such as BTC Math. BTC Math was founded by Noah Silverman, doctoral candidate in Statistics at UCLA, to cover Bitcoin related finance topics. Silverman predominantly focuses on the quantitative issues that arise from the nature of Bitcoin markets. Similar to BTC Math, The Standard Bit, serves as a Wall Street Insider\u2019s Guide to Bitcoin and the emerging virtual currency space. Launched by Jonathan Silverman, a former trader on Wall Street, The Standard Bit serves as another specialized blog to provide insight to those considering investing in Bitcoin.\nBitcoin Magazine hopes to continue to foster the spread of knowledge within the Bitcoin community and to help provide tools for individuals who have yet to learn about all the merits of this decentralized and efficient currency.

Martin Bryant (Managing Editor, The Next Web) moderated a panel entitled, \u201cThe Pros & Cons of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin Community was successfully represented by Tony Gallippi (CEO, BitPay), Roger Ver (Founder & CEO, MemoryDealers.com), and Shakil Khan (Head of Special Projects, Spotify and Founder, Coindesk). LeWeb London hoped to address some of the questions surrounding this digital, decentralized, cryptocurrency.\nAs the first panelist to speak, Roger Ver framed Bitcoin in a positive light stating, \u201cif you are using money in your business, you should be using Bitcoin.\u201d Ver explained that Bitcoin has enabled for the first time in the entire history of the world payment from one person to another anywhere around the world. Ver explained that through Bitcoin, individuals have a tool that enables greater control over their finances. Ver made his intentions clear and his support of the Bitcoin currency evident explaining that his goal will be achieved when at least everyone has heard of Bitcoin and at least has the option to use it if they choose. Despite initial steps of government regulation of the Bitcoin currency, Ver explained that even if governments decide they would like to eliminate Bitcoin completely, the only way they can do so would be by shutting down the internet completely. Ver highlighted that millions of dollars a month are being spent on real businesses through the Bitcoin currency.\nBitPay Co-Founder and CEO, Tony Gallippi, followed up by explaining the merits of Bitcoin as an open source peer to peer payment network. Gallippi expressed that Bitcoin will continue to become successful and mainstream, and there will be a point in which many will start using Bitcoin and not even realize they are using it. Bitcoin serves as an expedient mechanism to get payment from Point A to Point B.\nShakil Khan discussed his first encounter with the Bitcoin currency and why he has now chosen to invest in Bitcoin startups and run Bitcoin news site, Coindesk. Shakil also emphasized the need to have information available for individuals and businesses seeking to invest in Bitcoin. As Bitcoin continues to grow in prominence, Shakil hopes to facilitate education on the interaction between Bitcoin and financial systems.\nOf course, moderator, Martin Bryant, posed the typical, \u201cwho is Satoshi,\u201d question. Gallippi responded candidly that no matter who founded Bitcoin, the currency is now having a positive impact and thriving. We can look forward to continuing to see Bitcoin as a topic of conversation and a credible payment mechanism.", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 8}

Over a thousand people showed up, panelists discussed issues including financial privacy, alternate cryptocurrencies and even floating cities. Following that success, over the past few weeks a number of other Bitcoin-related events have also announced themselves. You may have already heard of some of the larger ones, but many of these events have been carely noticed by the Bitcoin community.\nPorcfest \u2013 Porcfest is not, strictly speaking, a Bitcoin-centric event; it is the main annual gathering of the New Hampshire-based Free State Project, and perhaps the largest libertarian political event in the United States. However, in 2012 Bitcoin all but consumed Porcfest, with 80% of merchants at the event accepting it. This year, Bitcoin will make an even stronger appearance, with three hour-long panel discussions dedicated to it. The event will take place near Lancaster, NH, from June 17-23.Bitcoin London \u2013 Bitcoin London will be an intivation-only event focusing on entrepreneurs, investors and hedge fund professionals. You can apply for invitations here, although it is expensive \u2013 the price will be 250 GDP ($380) for early-bird tickets and 600 GBP ($760) for everyone else. The event will take place in London on July 2.Inside Bitcoins Conference \u2013 MediaBistro\u2019s Inside Bitcoins conference in London will be a largely business-focused event, including speakers such as First Round Capital partner Phineas Barnes, Foodler founder Christian Dumontet, BitPay\u2019s Tony Gallippi and many other business owners and investors. It is notable that most of the speakers will be individuals from outside the Bitcoin community who are interested in Bitcoin, and so this event will be a great opportunity for much-needed outreach and interaction. The conference will take place in New York City on July 30.Bitcoin Convention Europe 2013 \u2013 as cordination consultant Matthew N Wright describes it, \u201cThis convention is an open, community driven effort with fund-raising aided by 000 Media. Rather than opt for a politically charged display of wealth, we\u2019re here to get back to the basics of what bitcoin really is\u2013 a community, decentralized effort. No foundations or agenda driven donors at this convention, just real people who really want the project to succeed.\u201d The speakers\u2019 list is currently still small, although it appears focused on Bitcoin entrepreneurs who are not as immersed the mainstream tech and business scene as the attendees of the Inside Bitcoins conference. The convention will take place in Amsterdam on September 27-29.Crypto-Currency Conference \u2013 this conference will be more focused on philosophical issues than the others, with speakers like Laissez Faire Books\u2019 Jeffrey Tucker, libertarian legal theorist Stephan Kinsella and the Mises Institute\u2019s Doug French, as well as the Bitcoin economist Peter Surda, Adam Levine and BitPay\u2019s Tony Gallippi. The conference will take place on October 5 in Atlanta.unSYSTEM \u2013 this conference, organized by Amir Taaki, will be the other major conference of this year. Although originally intended to be a Bitcoin conference, the conference\u2019s range of topics has been expanded to radical activism and social reform in general \u2013 hence the name, \u201cunSYSTEM\u201d. Of course, Bitcoin nevertheless remains a central, unifying theme. Speakers include Occupy London, Juice Rap News, Max Keiser, Defense Distributed\u2018s Cody Wilson, Berlin Bitcoin community organizer and restaurant owner Joerg Platzer and many more technological, artistic and political activists. The conference will taken place in Vienna on November 1-3.\nThe different themes of the various conferences shows an interesting pattern in the development of the Bitcoin community. Bitcoin advocates have always been split into camps, which can simply be named the idealistic and the pragmatic. Idealists include anti-banking activists, radical libertarians (of both the anti-capitalist and pro-capitalist variety), factions of Occupy Wall Street and others who are in some way dissatisfied with the current \u201csystem\u201d in general. Pragmatists are those who seek to present Bitcoin in a business-friendly package, focusing on more universally appealing aspects like low transaction fees and near-instant transactions. Since the 2013 Bitcoin conference, the pragmatist wing has become much more powerful, as its outreach efforts have now managed to attract tens of millions of dollars of investment, and among some there is a sentiment that the idealist wing is being left behind; some are concerned that Bitcoin is \u201csacrificing its soul to survive\u201d. However, the aspects of Bitcoin that make it palatable to idealists remain stronger than ever, and Porcfest and unSYSTEM represent great chances for the idealist factions to reclaim their lost importance.\nAlso importantly, this shows how the Bitcoin community is deliberately broadening its reach to beyond just the United States. For all the recent worry about FINCEN, a very large part of the Bitcoin community remains outside the United States, and conferences in various locations in Europe do a great deal to accomodate that. Even inside the United States, the conferences in New York and Atlanta appeal to local entrepreneurs and people in general who do not yet care enough about Bitcoin to have flown across the country to the conference in San Jose. And Bitcoin travellers now have one major event to go to for almost every month in the rest of this year (only August and December currently lack any event).", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 10}

The root cause of the shutdown is the closure of its RBC bank account on May 17 as well as \u201ca surge of fraudulent transactions\u201d. LibertyBit writes:\nThe effects have been two-fold: 1) Inflicting monetary losses on the company and 2) Damaging our primary banking relationships. These circumstances make it infeasible to continue operating the service without significant changes to our transfer system and identification measures. We feel it is our responsibility to pause operations now rather than risk any customer funds becoming vulnerable. We will be working in the coming weeks with partners and our legal counsel to overcome these obstacles and implement new measures to prevent these types of setbacks in the future.\nFortunately, no user funds have been lost, although withdrawals will be slower than usual; LibertyBit anticipates a waiting time of 1-3 days for BTC withdrawal and 2-10 business days for USD and CAD withdrawal. Additionally, the Interac E-transfer withdrawal option is no longer available, and users with CAD stored in the exchange will need to provide their banking info in order to be able to withdraw by direct deposit.\nThis is not the first time an exchange has declared a temporary shutdown for security reasons; Bitcoin Central did the same thing in late April following a medium-scale hack which emptied a relatively small, but nevertheless substantial, portion of their stored Bitcoin funds. In both cases, the shutdown was graceful, with users being able to recover their funds. The question is, will Libertybit\u2019s shutdown actually be temporary? Most shutdowns so far have proven to be permanent, and as much as 45% of all Bitcoin exchanges to have ever existed are now defunct, but there is precedent: Bitfloor and TradeHill have both managed to restart themselves after a prolonged and unscheduled downtime; in the latter case, the shutdown lasted for over a year and the exchange restarted with a completely different target market and brand.\nIn the meantime, Canadian Bitcoin users are encouraged to head over to CaVirtex or buy them in person at the next Toronto Bitcoin meetup.

But what is this strange technology that is behind all of this unexpected public attention? A cure for cancer? A solution to the problems of poverty and world hunger? No. As it turns out, the underlying technology is basically a clunky, inferior version of a phone, and is primarily used by terrorists and prepubescent children with nothing better to do with their lives than send each other images of cats. However, since this technology has been all the rage in the past few weeks, its supposed \u201cadvantages\u201d deserve a thorough debunking, and those who have so far been fortunate enough not to get caught up in the hype deserve a thorough understanding of just how pernicious and evil the underlying ideology of this \u201cinvention\u201d is.

If you read a sentence in a magazine, of hear someone speaking on TV, those words have been carefully rehearsed, sent through multiple layers of scrutiny and fact checking, and the speaker knows that if they make any claim that is false they can be sued under a robust framework of defamation law. Decency laws protect you from having to listen to anything containing harmful or psychologically traumatizing words. If you are a crazy libertarian, the presence of this kind of control may horrify you \u2013 but, but, that\u2019s authoritarian, you might argue. It\u2019s centralized! What if you want to say something controversial or obscene or outright false to listeners who \u201cvoluntarily\u201d turn on their televisions to some channel specifically because they want to receive it? In reality, however, these protections are necessary. They ensure that children get safe programs suited to meet their delicate psychological needs, and protect them from learning about the ravages of reality right up until the moment they are kicked out of their house to go to college and enter the jungle of drugs and sex and independent politics as soon as they hit 18. They make sure that so-called news \u201csources\u201d spreading misleading and fallacious information are either prevented from doing so entirely or are, at the very least, quickly discovered and made to answer for their lies. Without these protections, anyone could go out and say anything about any person and company and have untold consequences on society and the financial markets as everyone blindly believes what they are saying and retweets the news; with the checks and balances that traditional media provides, such things can never happen.We Already Have Good Communication Solutions \u2013 internet advocates often claim that the Internet is somehow massively better than all of the other options that we have available. The reality is, however, that as soon as you ask them how it does this their arguments immediately fall away. You can use the internet to talk to your friends, they argue. Well, of course you can, but we have already had a technology to do that for over a hundred years; they\u2019re called phones. Ah, but the internet is international and universally accessible. Well, phones are too, and with internet penetration at only around ten percent telephones are actually far superior. Can you use the internet to talk to your grocery store? No? Then the internet is not a \u201ccommunication medium\u201d. The same goes with TV; people are starting to use the internet to stream video to each other, but the result is a horrendously inefficient use of bandwidth that is rapidly using up billions of dollars of infrastructural investment, when if only users were willing to submit to the truly minor inconvenience of having to wait a few hours to watch (or record) the same data can be transmitted simply by broadcasting it all at once. The internet does have some minor advantages, and if it were thoughtfully integrated into a legitimate communications product it might be a good idea. But this is not a good idea, it is a scam, and someone out there is trying to become very rich off of this system until the inevitable collapse.The Internet Circumvents Authority And the Rule of Law \u2013 this is where we need to explain one of the more dangerous properties of the internet. In 1977, Rivest, Shamir and Adleman came up with a system for storing data that had some interesting properties. You can create a pair of keys, called a \u201cpublic key\u201d and a \u201cprivate key\u201d, such that you can \u201cencrypt\u201d data with the public key but then you would need the private key to decrypt it. Without the private key, encrypted data simply looks like random junk and nothing can be gleamed from it. This has some very positive legitimate military applications, as militaries can now communicate securely without having to securely transfer a common secret key first. However, soon enough so-called \u201ccrypto-anarchists\u201d began perverting cryptography to much more destructive ends. PGP, for example, provides a simple interface for anyone in the world to use public key cryptography to accept messages from anyone else in the world, so that no third party has the ability to read them. Read that carefully: no third party. Not \u201cno illegitimate third party\u201d, but \u201cno third party\u201d at all \u2013 including legitimate government operations that are conducted for the public good and restrained by robust, democratic checks and balances such as court-ordered warrants. Just how are government investigators supposed to avoid going dark and losing the ability to recover any data for investigative purposes at all? Well, if you are a libertarian and believe that government snooping equals intrusion of privacy, then you don\u2019t care much about this question because the answer you will get is, \u2018Well let\u2019s not get snooped on and let\u2019s allow the various intelligence agencies to wither,\u2019 but if on the other hand you believe that intelligence agencies are essential for maintaining civilised behaviour and for having regulation, then it is a problem.The Internet Circumvents Democracy \u2013 there are of course even easier ways to use the internet to circumvent the law. Following the tradition of \u201ctax havens\u201d, countries like Iceland are now trying to position themselves as data havens, extending their extremist interpretations of \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d to the entire world. Finally, many people simply ignore the law and hope for the best \u2013 a strategy that, given law enforcement\u2019s limited resources in these times of austerity, is unfortunately all too effective. Fundamentally, what politicians in Iceland, and internet-bugs in general, fail to realize that censorship is not \u201cdamage\u201d that should be \u201crouted around\u201d; it is a basic and necessary part of legislation in a harmonious society. Censorship protects religions from being brutally mocked by insensitive television programs and cartoons, it helps combat extremist ideologies and it helps protect ordinary people, especially children, from obscenity. And what are people using the internet for? As it turns out, it\u2019s mostly child pornography. Some civil-libertarian revolution.The Internet Is Backed By Nothing \u2013 when you buy a TV and a cable subscription in order to watch a particular set of broadcasts, how do you know that those shows are going to continue operating at a high standard of quality, or at least if they don\u2019t other equally good shows will take their place? The answer is, there are powerful commercial institutions behind these programs that are guaranteed to continue releasing them, and contracts with actors and crew that provide a strong incentive for them to make a fresh episode week after week. If a station decides to deliver a poor-quality episode, or even skip an episode some particular week, they will lose millions of dollars in profit, and there is a strong central point of attention to which people can direct their complaints. With the internet, none of this exists. On an internet forum, all content is user-generated content, and users have no financial incentive to produce quality content, or even continue producing any content at all. And those users are only on that forum in the first place because other users are on that forum, generating content for them in turn. So what happens if confidence in this network falters? Some users drop out, then because of them more users drop out, and the entire online \u201ccommunity\u201d disappears into thin air. I\u2019ve always said that the dollar is an \u201cI owe you nothing,\u201d and that the euro is a \u201cWho owes you nothing.\u201d On the internet, nobody owes you anything, and so it is inevitable that the scheme will collapse in its present form.\nUnfortunately, in the all too extreme and individualistic society that we live in today, it has become popular to think that we should just let everyone speak freely without controls and everything will somehow work itself out. But, as we all know, this is absurd. We cannot delude ourselves that free speech is the privilege of pure citizens in some perfect Enlightenment salon, where all sides of an argument are heard and the most noble view will naturally rise to the top. Speech now takes place in a digital mixing chamber, in which the most outrageous messages are instantly amplified, with sometimes violent effects. We have people spewing out hate speech, inciting riots and practically ordering other people\u2019s deaths. Sites like stormfront.org and \u201cBoycott American Women\u201d are repeatedly hitting front page headlines as their terrible and hateful ideologies are allowed to fester. We have unchecked laissez-faire internet-based social media platforms becoming an existential menace to society as unenlightened youth use them to launch outright revolutions against established authority. We have \u201ccrypto-anarchists\u201d writing manifestos about how the internet will bring about the outright demise of the legitimate and democratic nation state, and if the internet does grow to the extent that they imagine, all evidence shows that that is exactly what would come to pass. But fortunately, we do not have much to fear. The growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in \u201cMetcalfe\u2019s law\u201d\u2013which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants\u2013becomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other! By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet\u2019s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine\u2019s.", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 11}

Yesterday, major newswires including, Business Insider, CNN Money and MSN Moneyannounced the birth of the, \u201cFirst Bitcoin Baby.\u201d The Bitcoin currency is successfully infiltrating numerous aspects of life.\nDr. C. Terence Lee established Fertility Care of Orange County in 1997. In 2012, while browsing the internet, Dr. Lee learned about the Bitcoin. As Dr. Lee bases his career around providing life-giving services, he is now also investing in a vibrant new digital, decentralized currency with much potential. Nine months ago, Dr. Lee offered a couple a 50% discount should they cover the costs of a frozen embryo transfer cycle with the Bitcoin currency. Dr. Lee\u2019s transaction in BTC is to date the first payment for fertility treatments.\nPrior to the birth of the first Bitcoin baby, Dr. Lee presented at the 2013 Bitcoin Conference in San Jose to address, \u201cA Physician\u2019s Experience with Bitcoin.\u201d Dr. Lee touched upon the areas that are still open to the free market in the medical field. Currently, fertility clinics can still be operated in the free market space. Dr. Lee first transacted in Bitcoin in his business after posting an ad on Bitcoin Reddit offering a Male Fertility Test for payment in BTC. Since that first transaction, Dr. Lee has chosen to reach out to patients who normally would not transact in Bitcoin or have not heard about the currency to then encourage them to learn more about Bitcoin and further provide the opportunity for them to even pay for fertility treatments and consulting in BTC.\nTo the mainstream news media, Dr. Lee has forged the trail to not only accept payments for fertility consultation and treatment in the Bitcoin currency but also counsel individuals as how to use the digital, decentralized, cryptocurrency. Dr. Lee takes steps to guide patients to reliable Bitcoin exchanges and encourages couples to not only plan their future by starting a family but also through investing in Bitcoin. Bitcoin Magazine congratulates Dr. Lee on his accomplishments to date and encourages other medical professionals to follow suit.", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 11}
{"title": "Charlie Shrem: Bitcoin is cash with wings", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/charlie-shrem-online-cash-1370377785/", "birthday": "Jun 4, 2013  4:29 PM EST", "date": "2013-06-04 21:29:00", "content": "Charlie Shremis 23 years old and one of the leading Bitcoin entrepreneurs, having founded BitInstant in 2011. One of the early \u201cBitcoin millionaires\u201d he exemplifies the world of opportunity and adventure that Bitcoin has opened up to anyone willing to knuckle-down and start building the infrastructure that will make Bitcoin accessible to millions. He is also Vice-Chairman and co-founder of the Bitcoin Foundation.\n\nBitcoin Magazine:How and when did you learn about Bitcoin and what caught your eye at first?\nCharlie Shrem: I got involved in the Bitcoin community really early on. I was an econ grad in college and obviously interested in the space. The more I learned about Bitcoin the more I had to learn. I had never even heard of the Austrian theory of economics (it was all Keynes this and Keynes that in college). The idea \u2013 save money if you want to grow the economy was so foreign, I thought, hey maybe this could work. And from there I just really dove into it.\n\nBM:What pushed you into setting up a Bitcoin business?\nCS: Gareth Nelson reached out to me in 2011 via the Bitcoin forums. We had never met but respected each other\u2019s reputation. He had a great idea and really saw a pain in the Bitcoin ecosystem \u2013 moving money quickly. I recognized the opportunity and given my previous successful startup jumped at the opportunity to be more involved in Bitcoin. He handled the tech and I handled the business, it\u2019s a perfect partnership.\n\nBM:What would you say to encourage all those potential Bitcoin entrepreneurs out there?\nCS: Bitcoin is such a young experiment, there\u2019s so much opportunity for anyone with a great idea and the ability to execute it. I\u2019d definitely suggest putting your idea to paper, researching the marketplace and really exploring all the challenges you might face. Build a team of people you can really trust who will get things done. If you can put together a prototype, great, do it. Then start reaching out to friends and family for some initial investment. The more money you get from angels, the more of the company you can keep for yourself.\n\nBM:What are the online businesses that would benefit most from Bitcoin adoption and what are they waiting for?\nCS: All of them. Bitcoin makes so much sense for online transactions more than anything. Traditional banking infrastructure was never really designed for the online world and it\u2019s fraught with issues, the worst of which are ridiculous fees and security concerns. Bitcoin solves these problems \u2013 transactions can be executed and verified for a fraction of the cost of the older payment methods and the security is unbelievable.\n\nBM:Beyond being a better payment system, Bitcoin brings financial freedom to the masses. Why is this important? How will it change the world?\nCS: There are a lot of people who are politically motivated by Bitcoin and very vocal about how it can solve the world\u2019s problems. The phrase \u201cBitcoin will bring freedom to money like the Internet brought freedom to information\u201d is really true. Whether or not Bitcoin (or another digital currency) ever replaces fiat is an open question. But even if it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s disruptive. If it makes even a little impact (and I think it will) it really forces traditional payment systems to become more efficient, reduce friction and fees and increase security. Even these little changes when considered across trillions of dollars worth of transactions start to make a meaningful difference. If Bitcoin\u2019s existence can force online money transfer fees to be reduced by even 2% just think of how much money is saved and can go to improving the world in real ways (instead of losing that $10 to a big bank you could donate it at your local soup kitchen)!\n\nBM:Will established players and industries in the payment, banking (and central banking) world resist Bitcoin, or adopt it as an improvement on their current technology? How would you convince to embrace it instead of fighting it?\nCS: We\u2019ve already seen some signs that more traditional payment systems are starting to look at Bitcoin. You can be sure they\u2019re talking about it behind closed doors and wishing they had thought to implement something like it themselves. I think we\u2019ll see Bitcoin serving as a catalyst to push existing banking to take a hard look in on itself and really try to reduce the inefficiencies. The market will demand it \u2013 if Bitcoin is widely adopted and people understand how low the fees are, they\u2019re going to look at the same types of transactions taking place via banks and wire transfers and ask the hard questions \u201cWhy does it take 5 to 10 percent to send my money overseas? Why does it take three days to move money between accounts when it\u2019s an instant digital request?\u201d These questions are going to spark changes to the traditional banking systems \u2013 how they choose to address them is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nBM:Why is privacy important online? Is it just for porn, gambling and fraud? Is privacy a human right?\nCS: Since its inception, Bitcoin has obviously really struggled with definitions of privacy and anonymity. There\u2019s a big difference between regular, law-abiding people seeking privacy and those who seek to be anonymous for illicit activities. I believe that the right to privacy is fundamental. What exactly does it mean though? You should be able to buy legal items without it being tracked somewhere in a government database. Historically cash has provided this privacy. You could walk into a drugstore and buy medications for health problems that might be embarrassing and pay cash. Now, with credit cards everything is electronic and tracked. Bitcoin gives you some of the privacy back. I like to call it \u201ccash with wings.\u201d This basically means that it has all the conveniences of cash but you can use it over huge distances. People like to say \u201cOh, you could by drugs with Bitcoin!\u201d You can buy drugs with cash. You\u2019re not stopping people from doing the things they\u2019re going to do but you shouldn\u2019t penalize the people who are legitimately using a tool like Bitcoin to do things more efficiently in our modern world. At BitInstant we understand the need for financial regulations and have gone out of our way to be compliant \u2013 we know our customers. We\u2019re working to make government officials and naysayers understand that Bitcoin adopters are just visionaries who understand the need for a fundamental shift in the way we think about money.\n\nBM:Having your account blocked is a major problem with some online payment systems, and even bank accounts, as Cypriots learned to their misfortune. How does anyone put up with this now that you can use Bitcoin?\nCS: Even though Bitcoin is gaining in popularity it\u2019s still flying under most people\u2019s radar. It\u2019s still in a stage where people don\u2019t understand it and aren\u2019t aware of its benefits. There\u2019s also mistrust that we have to overcome. People are more willing to continue with the status quo than trust a new system. It won\u2019t be until more people are directly hurt by the current banking systems that they start to move away from it and look for alternatives. In the meantime, the early adopters (like me) will be here building the infrastructure and trust that ensures that Bitcoin will be here as an alternative to the pitfalls of the traditional banking structure.\n\nBM:If the US-based Bitcoin Foundation is ever co-opted by regulators to undermine the thingsthat make Bitcoin so liberating\u2026 will you denounce it? When there is a major Bitcoin fork, what principles will you fight for?\nCS: There\u2019s an awful lot of speculation in that question. Right now we\u2019re all (both Foundation members and the general Bitcoin community) doing our best to carve out a place for Bitcoin in the current regulatory climate. There are a lot of us who want to do things the right way and make sure Bitcoin is seen as legitimate. Speculating about the Foundation\u2019s future run-ins with regulators doesn\u2019t really get us anywhere. Right now the best we can do is to use the Foundation to promote Bitcoin, help protect the existing community and put it in front of people for more widespread adoption. As far as a fork goes, I don\u2019t like to say. I\u2019ve made my general opinions pretty clear in presentations and panels. But categorically stating my opinion about a forking situation that hasn\u2019t come up yet is just silly. Things change all the time.\nThat\u2019s the beauty of Bitcoin. It\u2019s not controlled by a central power and everyone has more of a say in what happens to the technology. My opinion changes based on a lot of things \u2013 like regulation, trust, the support of the community, improvements in technology \u2013 so I\u2019ll cross bridges as I come to them.\n\nBM:Bitinstant has made buying Bitcoin with fiat extremely easy in the US and several other countries. What are your expansion plans? When are you going to partner up with some major airport money changers?\nCS: BitInstant is committed to growth and helping more people in more places around the world acquire Bitcoin. But we\u2019re only interested in growth the right way. We could move fast and enter new markets and new countries\u2026but we won\u2019t do it until we\u2019re sure that it\u2019s sustainable and we don\u2019t get shut down. That means having the right partners and making sure we\u2019re within local regulations with what we\u2019re doing.\nWe\u2019ve heard a lot of interest from people in the UK, Australia, Cyprus, Greece\u2026the list is almost endless. And we\u2019re going to add the countries to our list, do our due diligence and make sure we\u2019re on solid ground in each country we move into.\n\nBM:What other part of the Bitcoin infrastructure is in urgent need of building? What major problems need solving for Bitcoin to grow?\nCS: One of the challenges that we\u2019re facing at BitInstant is an information problem. Just making more people aware of Bitcoin and separating it from some of its more radical roots and supporters. We believe that Bitcoin has value for everyone, regardless of politics. So making sure that we\u2019re doing our part to make the currency more accessible to the people it can really help the most is huge.", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 4}

Western Union will no longer accept money transfers between USD and Argentinian Pesos. At the end of May, new stricter regulations on Argentina\u2019s currency exchange prevented Google from even paying Android developers. With extreme inflation, a devalued currency, and increased and extreme regulations, Argentinians are looking to invest wisely and find alternative methods for buying and selling goods. The Bitcoin community is constantly growing in Argentina, but this week\u2019s announcement by Western Union will inevitably spark an even greater interest in the Bitcoin currency.\nWith a devalued Argentinian Peso, Argentinian citizens are looking to invest in a currency with a potential for greater value. Bitcoin permits Argentinians to not only have control over currency apart from a centralized source but also an opportunity to purchase products with ease internationally. Bitcoin opens the door to the global economy and allows for Argentinians to purchase goods from sellers within the country and internationally.\nWith a crippled national economy, Bitcoin brings life and opportunity to the financial future of many Argentinians. As Forbes Contributor, Jon Matonis highlighted in his article, \u201cBitcoin\u2019s Promise in Argentina,\u201d the benefits of Bitcoin when compared to paper cash are high. Recently, BitcoinFilm.org produced a short documentary about Bitcoin in Argentina. As Argentinian leadership continues to impose price controls and monetary exchange restrictions, the Bitcoin community continues to grow and thrive.\nFor most Argentinians, Bitcoin is a more viable source of savings, than pesos in the bank. With inflation nearing 30%, Argentinians are less concerned about the volatility of the Bitcoin currency than the government permitted devaluation of the Argentinian Peso. With the black market as the main means for acquiring the US dollar in Argentina, Bitcoin is not only legal, but a more valuable investment for Argentinians. When faced with the decision to hold onto a devalued currency or take the step to invest in the Bitcoin currency with great potential for growth, Argentinians should have an easy decision to make.

{"title": "TorBroker: Anonymous Finance and Trust", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/torbroker-anonymous-finance-and-trust-1371102804/", "birthday": "Jun 13, 2013  1:53 AM EST", "date": "2013-06-13 06:53:00", "content": "In late March, the cryptic underworld of the Tor hidden service ecosystem added a new service to its midst: TorBroker, a gateway for Bitcoin users to the stock markets of the mainstream world. This is not the first service to do such a thing; ICBit has been doing the same, albeit in a very limited fashion, for over a year by offering futures on oil, gold and the S&P 500. TorBroker on the other hand is, as its name suggests, a fully-fledged broker, allowing users to buy and sell any of nearly a thousand different stocks and exchange traded funds at any time. It is also the first such service to accept customers anonymously, using Tor to protect their anonymity and not asking for any identifying information beyond a username and password.\nThe service has seen some usage in the months since then, but many people remain highly skeptical. There are two reasons behind this: legality and trust. Operating this kind of pass-through investment service is not itself that legally difficult; although being a stock broker does require a license in the United States, the license requirements consist of having a company sponsor and passing an in-person examination. However, what is difficult is performing such a service without verifying the identity of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s clients. When asked about the legality of their service, TorBroker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s forum representative explained their legal strategy was that they would not actually be conferring legal ownership of any shares to their customers; rather, they would simply be passing on gains and losses, effectively acting as a sort of betting site specializing in the future value of financial assets. Torbroker wrote, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur lawyer has been in contact with the financial regulators in our local jurisdiction. He was given the information that at the moment there are no actual laws that explicitly forbid individual or company traders from passing on gains/losses to a third party [ie. including an anonymous third party] that has no legal ownership of the traded securities. Furthermore, there is no regulation regarding deposits in unregulated currencies (bananas, seashells, bitcoins). However, they stated they would look negatively on such a service, but they wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be able to legally take action against it as is.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\nThis is where the issues of legality and trust become intertwined. As a further legal safeguard for their service, TorBroker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s representatives have chosen to remain anonymous. Explaining their decision, TorBroker wrote to Bitcoin Magazine: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy going public we would attract the attention of local authorities who would be inclined to work on new regulation \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or even just try to find some non-essential technicality that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re unwittingly violating \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to stop our service. By keeping our jurisdiction secret, we avoid attracting such attention.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Howevver, this strategy has its costs. Out of all the major anonymously operated services in the Bitcoin economy, many, including Bitscalper, TorWallet and Bitcoin Savings and Trust, have turned out to be scams, eventually suddenly disappearing with thousands (and in the latter case, over 1 million) of dollars of deposited customer funds. Other anonymous sites, on the other hand, have survived, and Silk Road in particular may well now be the single most trusted cryptographically anonymous entity in the world, so on the balance the question of whether or not one can ever trust an anonymous service remains hotly debated.\nThe general consensus view is that it depends on the precise nature of the service in question \\xe2\\x80\\x93 specifically, the trust to profit ratio. On the Silk Road, an eBay-style marketplace for illegal drugs that, like TorBroker, uses Tor to help ensure both itself and its users anonymity, this ratio is fairly low, both with regard to Silk Road itself and even between buyer and seller. Each individual transaction brings a significant benefit to both the buyer and the seller (laying aside the argument that some users may be addicted and would benefit more from being forced to go cold-turkey; this is a purely conventional economic analysis), especially so because black markets tend to be very inefficient and so have high producer and consumer surplus per transaction, and Silk Road itself earns an average commisssion of about 6.3%. Thus, for both Silk Road and the anonymous merchant, profit is high. As for trust, the buyer only needs to trust the merchant to ship the goods each transaction, and needs to trust Silk Road to the same extent when depositing into their Silk Road account (or perhaps to a slightly greater extent, if the buyer also wants to have cash on hand in their Silk Road account to be able to buy a certain quantity of goods at will). Since profit is high and trust is low, the trust to profit ratio is very low, and so both Silk Road and the merchant have strong incentives to continue acting honestly \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the value of the relationships is too high to justify running away at any particular point.\nNow, consider Torwallet. Torwallet was essentially an anonymizing mixing service and a Bitcoin wallet all in one. Here, the wallet is usually free, although users can opt to have their coins mixed again at any time for a fee of 3%. Thus, profit is considerably lower than on Silk Road. As for trust, Torwallet is intended to be used as a wallet, encouraging users to deposit significant quantities of money into the wallet and, importantly, store them there for a long time. Thus, compared to Silk Road trust is very high. Thus, predictably, TorWallet eventually ran away. Bitscalper and Bitcoin Savings and Trust have even higher trust to profit ratios, as the service (in both cases, investment returns) requires the user to keep their money deposited for an extended period of time.\nUnfortunately, TorBroker falls squarely on the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cuntrustworthy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d side of this analysis. This is not their fault; it is simply a characteristic of the financial industry that trust to profit ratios are high, and this model, combined with an understanding of the more subtle, and legal, ways a business can probabilistically \\xe2\\x80\\x9crun away\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, even perfectly explains the recent global financial meltdown. However, there is one unique factor that does rest strongly in TorBroker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s favor. BitcoinStore\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Roger Ver made a post in TorBroker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s introductory thread on Bitcointalk, writing:\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know TorBroker or any of the people behind it, but about a month and a half ago they contacted me, and at least one other well known member of the Bitcoin community and asked us to publicly hold 1,000 BTC as a security bond that would be used to refund customers if TorBroker ever disappeared with their customers money. While I fully support TorBroker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s efforts to bring additional economic freedom to traditional financial markets, legally it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem safe for me to be the front man for this.\nTorBroker has also tried to place this bond with many other prominent Bitcoin community members (who won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be named to protect privacy), and, if trust proves to be too insurmountable an obstacle, is even willing to consider placing the bond with Silk Road\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own Dread Pirate Roberts. This would change the trust to profit calculus considerably; the extent to which TorBroker would benefit from running away would then be reduced by 1000 BTC, and, presumably, if TorBroker does run away the funds would then be proportionately distributed to depositors. For now, no security bond has been placed, but the fact that they are willing to voluntarily do so does suggest that they are attempting to build a viable and lasting business.\nHowever, there are steps that TorBroker could take to reduce the trust to profit ratio even further. TorBroker charges a commission of 1% per trade (minimum fee $10), specifically encouraging investment strategies that keep money in the service for a long time. The minimum fee also discourages users from trying out small amounts they can afford to lose first before investing more heavily. If the commission was replaced with, for example, a 10% fee on user profits, it would become much more viable to invest for only a few weeks or even day trade, benefitting from the service without trusting TorBroker nearly as much. They could also, instead of having a fixed-size security bond, constantly keep the majority of users\\xe2\\x80\\x99 funds escrowed with a trusted third party. Such a strategy was in fact suggested for Bitscalper, although Bitscalper obviously rejected it because they intended to run away with the money.\nMore recently, TorBroker has come up with several upgrades to their platform. In early June, they released a better securities list interface, an improved order system, performance and stability enhancements and reducing the minimum fee to $5 until July 11. They also released a promotional video explaining the benefits of their service:\n\nThe video begins by highlighting the three main disadvantages of traditional stock brokers: that they are \\xe2\\x80\\x9coverregulated and complicated\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, leading to bureaucratic inconvenience and a prolonged process in order to set up an account, they require minimum deposits that can be as high as $10,000, and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBig Brother is watching all your transfers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d TorBroker, of course, has none of these flaws. However, it does have weaknesses. Although it bypasses the inefficiencies of government regulation, its anonymous nature also sacrifices the main benefit that government can provide: trust. As discussed above, this is not an easily solvable issue, although there are many ways that TorBroker can mitigate it. Also, its $10 minimum fee itself functions as a de-facto minimum deposit; if one wants to trade only $100, a $10 fee is a whopping 10% off of every transaction. TorBroker would do well to go even further than their promotion and remove the fee outright, replacing it with a more even fee structure. As for privacy, here TorBroker indeed wins by a wide margin. Although the service sees all of your trades, it has no idea who you are, and everyone else knows nothing at all (although perhaps with blockchain analysis it may be possible in certain cases to detect that a given individual is using TorBroker; the Blockchain.info mixer can plug this small potential leak for an additional 0.5% fee.\nShould you invest using TorBroker? Well, if you need anonymity, you might. Safety is not guaranteed; TorBroker may still run away with all of their customers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 funds tomorrow, and there would be no way to even start trying to get the money back. If you are already investing in a very high risk portfolio, this additional risk may be manageable; if you are trying to secure 2% returns for grandma\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pension fund, forget it. If it does disappear, it will be added to the list of scams and thefts and soon forgotten. If it survives and continues to grow, it may well be an interesting experiment in the growing field of \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccrypto-economics\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, and an example for more commercial hidden services to come.", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 13}

He irradiates optimism about Bitcoin and the endless possibilities it brings, he also understands its resilience and expects it to thrive despite the many attacks that it will probably suffer from the old order that it disrupts and will displace.Bitcoin Magazine: Why, when and how did you become interested in Bitcoin?Jeremias Kangas: I just spotted an article about it on hacker news, and instantly started thinking how awesome it would be. At first I was mostly excited by the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmoney as a protocol\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thing - startups and small companies can avoid fees and innovate on top of Bitcoin easily. Then slowly I started to get a larger grasp on the socio-economic implications of Bitcoin.Currently I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m mostly excited about the possibilities for 3rd world countries. The countries without a stable and cost-effective financial infrastructure or lousy national currencies can benefit the most.BM: Why did you decide to create localbitcoins.com? Why are P2P exchanges important for Bitcoin? Isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Localbitcoins.com already a de-facto decentralised exchange?JK: There were plenty of sites that listed local Bitcoin exchangers, but in my opinion they all sucked. Therefore I started doing my own, and hired my brother to help me. At first it was a really simple location-based list, with no user accounts and URL-based identifying. From there we iterated and improved the concept based on customer feedback, and nowadays localbitcoins.com is vastly different from the initial prototype.P2P exchanges are more resilient than centralized exchanges, therefore I believe that in long run decentralized exchanges will win over the centralized ones. I also believe that decentralized exchanges can make Bitcoin spread much faster - if done right.Localbitcoins.com isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a real decentralized exchange, as we still rely on central server. However as with anonymity, decentralization is a floating variable, not a boolean. Localbitcoins.com is less centralized than many others, and we have plans to develop our infrastructure to make it even more resilient.BM: Localbitcoins has an extremely broad and global base; however centralised exchanges still have more depth and volume. Any plans to encourage larger volume ads?JK: We will have volume-based discounts in the near future. I definitely agree that the depth and liquidity is a problem with de-centralized exchange model. We have some other ideas to overcome those problems in the longer run.BM: How many users does Localbitcoins have? What BTC volume is currently being offered through your ads? Will you increase the number of statistics publicly available or offer more charts? Would you like prices set by (volume-averaged) localbitcoins transactions to be a market reference like the Mt.Gox price is currently?JK: We currently have 44k users, and just today about 300 new user accounts were opened. Lately we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had around 250 new users/day. Our volume is usually in the 400-900 BTC/day range.We want to offer the charts and statistics through our website, but we haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t had yet time and resources to do this yet. Also an API for external developers is on the roadmap.BM: As long as you run a P2P ad service in which you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t actually buy and sell bitcoins yourself, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to register as a MSB or comply with all the burdensome regulations of exchangers. Does that make your life easier?JK: Yes. Of course we will still have to adhere to any regulation which might be coming for bitcoin services.BM: Are you planning to add more security, escrow and reputation features?JK: We will be improving the security issues with multiple methods. We will be improving the reputation system and feedback loop heavily in the coming months, so that it is more useful.We are also researching different identification methods, which would add credibility to users. Currently we have SMS based identification, which sellers can require from trading partners. We will try to keep these as optional as possible, so that invidual traders can check which kind of identifications or security measurements they require.Currently traders can specify limits which depend on volumes of trading counterparties. We will add more options which allows different limits for differently reputated traders. Bitcoin-security wise I\\'m mostly excited about Bitcoin Trezor. If those guys manage to ship it, we could order a localbitcoins.com -branded batch and give them out to our active traders and sell and market to other users.BM: Users can now price their BTC in XAU (ounces of gold) and XAG (ounces of silver) at Localbitcoins. Do you expect goldbugs to wake up to the fact that they can now easily buy and sell bitcoins for gold?JK: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not a gold-bug myself, so I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fully understand the hype around it. However I realize that there exist many goldbugs in the Bitcoin community. Thus, \\xc2\\xa0I have myself bought miniscule amounts of precious metals. At some point I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll try to trade them on LocalBitcoins.com, and see how we can make metal-trading easier there, or if there exists demand for it.BM: Localbitcoins.com now has users buying and selling bitcoins in over 140 countries around the world. What are your plans for the future?JK: We currently have 142 countries and 1700 cities, but that most definitely isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t enough. We want to expand to at least 170.000 cities, and have LocalBitcoins,com-branded franchise exchange shops popping up here and there. Global world domination is our goal!BM: Can Bitcoin be shut down by unfriendly regulators or governments? How could the Cuban or North Korean government stop me from buying and selling bitcoins? Are you worried about censorship?JK: Bitcoin can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be shut down, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure that people will continue using it, whatever happens. Services like LocalBitcoins.com can be shut down, but we have plans how to make our infrastructure more resilient in a way that shutting the service down will be more difficult. I guess also other bitocin services are designing their technology in a resilient way.BM: You are also involved in several other Bitcoin sites, like Easywallet.org and Acceptbit.com. Do you have any new projects in the works?JK: Currently I believe that we have the most impact with LocalBitcoins.com. \\xc2\\xa0Our team is focusing all of our efforts towards developing it.There are tons of great ideas around Bitcoin. I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be having any free-time from localbitcoins.com in the short-term future. I hope in year or two, I can start some cool hobby sideproject. Meanwhile,\\xc2\\xa0localbitcoins.com\\xc2\\xa0as a company will try to provide bounties for open source projects in the future, so at least that way we can participate in some cool open source projects.", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 14}

{"title": "btcd: A Full Alternative Bitcoin Implementation, Written In Go", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/btcd-a-full-bitcoin-alternative-written-in-go-1368114292/", "birthday": "May 9, 2013  11:44 AM EST", "date": "2013-05-09 16:44:00", "content": "Conformal, a company focused on building open-source software for privacy and security, has revealed their latest project: btcd, a full Bitcoin reimplementation in Google\u2019s programming language Go. The implementation is not yet entirely done, but most core features such as transaction verification, database interaction and network connectivity are tested as working, and the company has released one component of the system for public review: btcwire, a package that focuses on converting Bitcoin protocol messages between btcd\u2019s internal representation of the message and a serialized form suited for direct network transmission, as well as actually sending and receiving these messages over network connections. Conformal provides a more detailed description of btcwire on their website.\nThe company has also written a blog post explaining their decision to make this alternative implementation; they write:\nA number of us at Conformal Systems had been keeping an eye on Bitcoin as passive observers for the past couple years since Bitcoin combines technologies that are already of interest to us: practical use of cryptography, distributed systems, and electronic payments. In January 2013 I had one of our developers, David Hill, attempt to port bitcoind and its GUI to Bitrig, an OS that several of our developers forked from OpenBSD. David encountered several problems with porting to Bitrig and in the process found issues with unit tests, non-portable functions and seeding of a PRNG. While pushing to get the port complete, it was clear that it would take a lot more effort than usual to complete this port. After seeing these issues with the porting, I felt that the Bitcoin ecosystem could use an alternative to bitcoind.\nAs for why they chose the programming language Go, they write that Go has a number of advantages over the C++ used by the only full Bitcoin implementation currently in major use, bitcoind. Particularly importantly for financial software, Go offers \u201cintegrated test infrastructure, no active memory management, standard formatting, platform independent code, simpler parallelism, built-in profiling and documentation facilities [and is] virtually crash-proof.\u201d Integrated test infrastructure is particularly important; the easier and more natural it is to write tests, the more tests can be written, and the smaller the chance we will see another serious blockchain fork from an unforeseen edge case. Parallelism, profiling and crash-proofness are also particularly useful attributed for Bitcoin exchanges, so given the performance bottlenecks that all exchanges were revealed to have in the Bitcoin market crash in April new exchange developers may well consider using Go as their language of choice.\nThis is not the first attempt at reimplementing the Bitcoin protocol; Amir Taaki\u2019s libbitcoin (written in C++) and Mike Hearn\u2019s BitcoinJ (Java) have both accomplished the feat, although the former is being used only in some experimental versions of the Electrum server software and the latter in some Android light clients. Importantly, there are no alternative implementations of Bitcoin that are currently being used to any significant degree by miners.\nThere are reasons to believe that this is unhealthy for the Bitcoin ecosystem. In theory, Bitcoin is an open source protocol in which anyone can participate, and on most levels that is true. Partial implementations of Bitcoin that can make and verify transactions exist already, and are the backbone of alternative Bitcoin clients like Blockchain and Electrum. In practice, the deeper into the protocol one goes the more it becomes a monoculture, but monocultures are dangerous. If there is only one implementation being widely used, then unforeseen bugs appearing (or even disappearing) in upgrades can cause the entire Bitcoin blockchain to essentially fork into two as the two versions of the protocol disagree on which transactions and blocks are valid and which are not. Because the blockchain builds on itself, even one mistake will have consequences that cascade forever into the future.\nThis was the cause behind the blockchain fork that took place in March \u2013 a previously unknown limitation in the database software used by bitcoind 0.7 caused a fork only after bitcoin 0.8, which used a different database which did not have this limitation, was released. The two versions then disagreed on the validity of a single block, and the fork followed from there, sending the price crashing by 23% before enough major mining pools got together on IRC chat to correct the issue. With three or five re-implementations, on the other hand, any single version disagreeing with the others will be highly inconvenient for users of that version, but will not have a grave effect on the entire network.\nMultiple implementations is also good for standardization; in a monoculture, the dominant software becomes the standard, giving the developers of the dominant software a higher degree of control over the future development of the protocol than was originally intended. This does not even require the developers to make a conscious decision to start subverting the design process for personal gain to be harmful. Even if, as is almost certainly the case today, developers are acting with the best of intentions, there is a bias in software development toward increasing complexity and confusion that is mitigated if multiple implementations have to work together on every change. If there is only one implementation, errors get uncovered later rather than sooner, and the result is a sort of Talebian \u201cstability breeding its own instability\u201d that ultimately, as in the case of the March blockchain fork, causes disaster. Additionally, developers have no incentive to even document the protocol as long as it works internally. Currently documentation does exist on the Bitcoin wiki, but with multiple implementations we can be much more certain that the page will be updated, and even improve in quality, in the future.\nWhether or not btcd will actually be used by miners is hard to say; it is entirely possible that miners will remain comfortable with the existing bitcoind, and the stability through decentralization that a healthy ecosystem of alternative implementations can bring will never come to pass. But even in such a state, this will still be a step forward for Bitcoin if only because it makes it easier for Go users to interact with the protcol. A Bitcoin implementation in Go has already been written, but it has not been updated in nearly a year, and appears to have only ever had a single developer behind it. btcd is backed by a corporation that is clearly well-versed in security and privacy, inspiring much more confidence in its reliability.\nFor the near future, Conformal writes that \u201cour goal is to continue releasing packages from btcd as we increase test coverage and bring them up to a professional level. The intent is that each piece can then be publicly reviewed for correctness as they become available while we continue work on the remaining packages.\u201d The company intends to continue releasing packages over the next several weeks, pushing out one at a time so that the community can better review the packages as they come out. Their next release will be btcjson, a package the deals with JSON-RPC messages. You can watch out for more releases on the Conformal blog.", "year": 2013, "month": 5, "day": 9}

The Bitcoin Foundation-organized event, entitled \u201cThe Future of Payments\u201d is likely to be by far the largest gathering of Bitcoin users yet, with well over 500 people already signed up to attend. The conference will focus on three main aspects of Bitcoin: technology and mining, business, and economic and regulatory issues, and presentations throughout the conference will be run in parallel, one from each category at a time. Just like the previous two conferences in 2011 and 2012, alongside the presentations themselves there will be a number of other special events on the side.\nThis is not the only major Bitcoin-related event to watch out for this year. From June 17 to June 23, the Free State Project in New Hampshire will be hosting PorcFest, an annual event dedicated to various aspects of libertarian philosophy. The event includes a marketplace called Agora Valley, and in 2012 one Bitcoin user noted that over 80% of the merchants were accepting Bitcoin. Given how much Bitcoin has grown since then, we can expect Bitcoin to have an even larger presence in the event this time around. In July, the tech and business side of Bitcoin will get MediaBistro\u2019s Inside Bitcoin conference on July 30 in New York, with BitInstant\u2019s Charlie Shrem as the featured speaker. Important financial entrepreneurs and investors like ZipZap\u2019s Alan Safahi and Knight Capital\u2019s Abelardo Mendez will also be present. In November, the unSYSTEM conference will take place in Vienna, focusing on the ideological side of Bitcoin as well as activism in general. Speakers include Occupy London, Juice Rap News, Max Keiser, Defense Distributed\u2018s Cody Wilson, Berlin Bitcoin community organizer and restaurant owner Joerg Platzer and many more technological, artistic and political activists. Depending on their interests, Bitcoin enthusiasts may well consider attending one or more of these conferences in addition to (or perhaps in place of, in case of limited time or budget) this one.\nThe conference costs $300 to register ($350 at the door), a price which may seem steep, but one should bear in mind that most people attending the conference will be coming in by plane and therefore paying much more for airport and hotel expenses anyway. The difference between paying $1030 for a $30 conference and $1300 for a $300 conference is not all that much. The full schedule for the conference can be found here; the following is a list of some of the more interesting parts of the conference to watch out for.\nThe Tech and Mining Track \u2013 one of the three sets of presentations to take place throughout the conference will focus on Bitcoin mining and technology. This section will largely feature generic discussions on various topics surrounding Bitcoin technology, including a \u201cState of the Union\u201d address by Gavin Andresen, ease of use, security, mining pool rewards and electricity, although it will also have more targeted discussions on the topics of alternate cryptocurrencies, hierarchical deterministic wallets and Trezor, the Bitcoin USB Wallet.The Business Track \u2013 for those already working with Bitcoin in their businesses or interested in doing so, this is the place to be. Presentations include Roger Ver\u2019s \u201cBitcoin 101 for Business\u201d, fraud prevention, overcoming the challenges of accepting Bitcoin, driving Bitcoin adoption, investing in Bitcoin businesses, international business and nonprofits, as well as several discussions on the interaction between Bitcoin and the existing financial system from speakers like Bitcoin Central\u2019s Pierre Noizat and BitInstant\u2019s Charlie Shrem.The Economic and Regulatory Track \u2013 this track is a bit of a strange merger, combining what may be some of the ideological discussion about Bitcoin to formally take place in the conference with the most pragmatic. Half of the topics are about how Bitcoin can radically change aspects of the current \u201csystem\u201d, and the other half are about how Bitcoin can interact with it. On the \u201ceconomics\u201d side, the topics include \u201cWill Bitcoin Change the Payments Landscape?\u201d, \u201cThe Role of Bitcoin As Money\u201d, \u201cEconomics of Bitcoin\u201d, a presentation by Blueseed and \u201cThe Future of Panhandling\u201d by Sean\u2019s Outpost\u2019s Jason King. On the regulatory side, the three presentations are on the legal classification of Bitcoin, issues of regulatory compliance, and financial privacy and law enforcement.Exhibitions \u2013 throughout the conference, as well as on the Friday before it, Bitcoin businesses will be holding exhibitions, and many will be using the opportunity to make announcements or unveil new products or features. Zach Harvey\u2019s Bitcoin ATM (as opposed to the one connected with Jeff Berwick), for example, will be using the conference to make its first public launch. The full list of exhibitors can be found here.The Hackathon \u2013 there have been Bitcoin-themed hackathons before, but the one that will take place alongside the Bitcoin conference is particularly interesting since it will be judged by actual Bitcoin business owners and investors: Brian Armstrong, Adam Draper, Alex Ferrera, Jeremy Liew and Tihan Seale.\nAbove all, the conference gives attendees a chance to meet and interact with fellow Bitcoiners from around the world. This includes many of the key figures in the Bitcoin community, including Bitcoin business owners, developers and investors, as well as ordinary enthusiasts from all around the world. If you are interested in getting involved with a Bitcoin project, whether a business, an open source software project or a charity, this will be a great opportunity to meet and talk to people that might be interested in having you onboard. Those who are unable to attend the conference will be able to watch all of the presentations on video, and Bitcoin Magazine will be releasing exclusive content from the conference in both our web and print editions. If you will be attending, enjoy the conference!", "year": 2013, "month": 5, "day": 14}

The idea grew to fruition at an impressive rate, to a fantastic degree.\n\u201cThe people who ended up helping out with this were, to me, the true believers in Bitcoin.\u201d Draper said. \u201cIt was really great to get the big names behind it and it came together fast, within a week.\u201d\nSo far only two of the Bitcoin-specific slots in Boost\u2019s summer program have been filled and Draper has mentioned that they are willing to accept even more Bitcoin companies than the previously allotted amount if the right companies apply. In the meantime, the rewards of acceptance are growing beyond the scope of the already spectacular opportunity. When the program starts at the end of June members of the participating companies will be moved into the newly renovated Benjamin Franklin Hotel and are given office space and mentorship to develop their business. At the end of the program each company that graduates is given an initial investment in the neighborhood of $10k to $15k which will now be significantly more for Bitcoin companies in particular.\n\u201cEvery company going through the boost program already has these really great people who really want Bitcoin to succeed, and they are also really great investors.\u201d As Draper explains, there is more than just money being rewarded to the Bitcoin graduates and the benefit spreads beyond those few lucky businesses, \u201cBecause we have such great investors behind it, I want more investors to get involved in Bitcoin.\u201d\nThe application to the next Boost session is available on their website and is open to businesses at any stage of development located anywhere in the world. The program is purposefully sector agnostic while the VCs explore their defining characteristics in a rapidly changing economy. Draper and Williams\u2019 excitement for Bitcoin is evident in their put-your-money-where-your-mouth-is attitude and hard work that is paying off for burgeoning Bitcoin businesses now and soon for investors that are becoming enlightened to the revolutionary capabilities of Bitcoin not only as a currency but also the technology and everything that it represents.", "year": 2013, "month": 5, "day": 14}

BitPay\u2019s ambitions have been global from the outset, and at Founders Fund we have been impressed with the company\u2019s tremendous growth as they sign up hundreds of new customers a day, turning the potential for opportunity into a reality.\u201d\nAs BitPay has expanded tremendously just in the month of April alone, the what once started as a team of two has now expanded to 10 employees and counting. BitPay added over 1,900 new merchants during the month of April, and they continue to dominate the bitcoin payments space by signing up over 100 new merchants per day. Through BitPay\u2019s service, around $5 million per month worth of bitcoins are spent on goods and services with merchants around the world. Businesses selling electronics, precious metals, and other low-margin products over the internet are seeing a large increase in profitability by accepting bitcoin payments.\nAs BitPay sets the tone for innovation in the payment processing world, its work has not gone unnoticed, specifically on the international front. Also joining this round of funding is Max Keiser\u2019s fund Heisenberg Capital, a London-based fund focused on bitcoin companies. Having previously interview BitPay Co-Founder and CEO, Tony Gallippi on his show, The Keiser Report, Max has demonstrated a keen interest in the progress and development of bitcoin and the implementation of practical ways to continue to make this digital, decentralized currency flourish.\nWhile the terms of the seed round were not disclosed, although 100% of the existing seed shareholders exercised their pro rata rights to maintain their ownership percentage in BitPay.

There were no presentations yet, other than an opening address including Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, but right from the moment businesses started setting up their booths around noon the conference room was teeming with life. Over a dozen booths were present, with nearly every major business \u2013 BitInstant, BitPay, BitcoinStore and more, having some representation.\nFor long-time Bitcoin users, events like this are particularly emotional; here, for the first time, we are able to see fellow Bitcoin users, whom we have loved, worked with and had heated arguments with over forums or skype/IRC chat for many months or years as something more than just a username. Entire companies, existing only \u201con the cloud\u201d before this day, are finally reunited \u2013 I myself had this experience finally meeting Tony Gallippi and Elizabeth Ploshay.\nOfficially, the main attraction of today was the exhibitions. Many established businesses in the Bitcoin community were present, but there were anso a number of companies that have until now barely had any public attention at all. Here is a listing of some \u2013 although certainly not all \u2013 of the interesting ones.\nMycelium \u2013 the Bitcoin Card has been around as an idea for a long time; the Internet Archive shows the site existing since as long as March 2012. The basic premise is that the Bitcoin Card will be a standard credit card-sized (including the thickness) Bitcoin hardware wallet, including some mesh networking features to help facilitate in-person Bitcoin payments. Many assumed that the company had simply faded away like so many other idealistic software efforts, but it turns out that it is still going strong \u2013 in fact, it is Bitcoin 2013\u2019s premiere sponsor. We\u2019ll have a more in-depth look at what this company really has in store in an upcoming issue of the magazine.Bitcoin Armory \u2013 the Bitcoin Armory project had two representatives showing its newest features: printer-safe paper backups (you need to write down a small portion of the code by hand so that a corrupted printer could not steal your money) and M-of-N paper backups \u2013 just in time after I wrote an article suggesting that people use such a feature.Free State Project \u2013 one thing that the first day of the conference has made very clear is that the US liberty movement is endorsing Bitcoin like never before. Free Talk Live, one of the movement\u2019s most popular radio shows, broadcast its latest episode live from the conference. Bitcoin Not Bombs, Fr33 Aid and Lamassu\u2019s Bitcoin ATM, all affiliated with the project, were present, and although Open Garden is not affiliated with the FSP directly its representative was seen with many stickers supporting the movement on the back of her laptop.BitPay \u2013 the company\u2019s CEO Tony Gallippi has become a celebrity in the Bitcoin world for the work that the company has been doing getting Bitcoin merchants signed up (at the conference, Gallippi announced that they now have 7000, and are gaining 100 per day), and especially so after the recent $2 million investment round by Peter Thiel. BitPay\u2019s main competitors, Coinbase and BIPS, were also present.Lamassu Bitcoin ATM \u2013 this is one of the two Bitcoin ATM projects that we have all been waiting for, run by Josh and Zach Harvey. This one only goes in one direction; you feed in a USD bill, make your phone\u2019s wallet application show the QR code of your receiving address, put the phone against the scanner, click \u201cconfirm\u201d, and voil\u00e0. The system did not always work; if the machine\u2019s Bitcoin balance was supplied in a single transaction, the first purchase made will work, but the second may not if it occurs too soon afterwards. The reason has to do with Bitcoin\u2019s concept of \u201cchange\u201d; one limitation of Bitcoin is that transaction outputs must be spent all at once; if you received 20 BTC but want to send 5 BTC to someone else, you need to send the entire 20 BTC, but simply have a 15 BTC output redirecting back to yourself. However, while the 15 BTC is not yet confirmed, some Bitcoin wallets do not allow you to spend it, so your Bitcoin balance would temporarily reduce to zero. The problem is an inconvenience, but it is not critical; the obvious quick fix is to simply feed the machine with many transactions of 0.1 BTC each rather than a single large transaction.Hardware Wallets \u2013 there are actually two hardware wallet companies at Bitcoin 2013: Butterfly Labs\u2019 BitSafe snd BTChip. The BitSafe is similar in form to the Trezor that Slush\u2019s Marek Palatinus and Pavol Rusnak have been developing for nearly a year now, offering essentially the same features (although BitSafe does promise a lower price point). BTChip is targeting the same use cases, but is cheaper and more basic in its features. Interestingly, both companies are working hard on supporting online wallets like blockchain.info, even though doing so is inherently a harder task since browser Javascript cannot directly talk to USB ports. The solution both companies are using is creating a downloadable program to run in the background as an intermediary \u2013 Javascript would talk to it via HTTP, and it would use various drivers to communicate with the hardware.\nToday and tomorrow, the focus of the event will be presentations and panel discussions. Everyone who is at the conference can feel free to talk to me personally or buy issues 7,8 or 9 of the magazine at Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s corner of the BitPay booth. Issue 10 will be going to print very soon as well. Continue to enjoy the conference!", "year": 2013, "month": 5, "day": 18}
{"title": "Bitcoin Self-Defense, Part I: Wallet Protection", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-self-defense-part-i-wallet-protection-1368758841/", "birthday": "May 16, 2013  10:47 PM EST", "date": "2013-05-17 03:47:00", "content": "Wallet security has always been a primary concern in the Bitcoin development community. Although no other payment system in existence grants you the same level of freedom and control over your money that Bitcoin does, at the same time it can also be its greatest weakness. If you lose your wallet, or the password to your wallet, there is (usually) no one who can help you recover it. If someone else gains access to your wallet (and your password) and steals everything, there is no way to reverse the transaction. This has all been known for the past four years, and great progress in security has been made, but many people do not realize that we still actually have a long way to go. Even if you take all of the standard security precautions, as the examples I am about to give will show, often a single mistake can undo all of your hard work and set you back tens of thousands of dollars. What this article will do is explore some of the more worrying examples of recent (and not-so-recent) losses and thefts, and what users and developers can do to protect themselves.\nThe Allinvain Theft\nBecause of the sheer amount of media attention that it received, arguably no list of Bitcoin-related security incidents is complete without this one. In June 2011, the Bitcointalk member \u201callinvain\u201d lost 25,000 BTC (worth $500,000 at the time) after an unknown intruder somehow gained direct access to his computer. The attacker was able to access allinvain\u2019s wallet.dat file, and quickly empty out the wallet \u2013 either by sending a transaction from allinvain\u2019s computer itself, or by simply uploading the wallet.dat file and emptying it on his own machine. The solution to this is obvious: wallet encryption. In allinvain\u2019s time, this was not so simple; one would need to use a generic encryption program (eg. ccrypt) to encrypt the wallet, and then every time one wanted to spend one\u2019s funds one would need to decrypt the wallet, use it, and then encrypt it again. Today, the process is much easier; wallet encryption has been built in to BitcoinQt since version 0.4 in September 2011, and Electrum, Armory and MultiBit all have a similar feature as well.\nThe Stefan Thomas Loss\nThis next incident is also fairly ancient in Bitcoin terms, taking place in July 2011, illustrates how wallet security can also fail in the other direction. Bitcoin developer Stefan Thomas had three backups of his wallet \u2013 an encrypted USB stick, a Dropbox account and a Virtualbox virtual machine. However, he managed to erase two of them and forget the password to the third, forever losing access to 7,000 BTC (worth $125,000 at the time). Thomas\u2019s reaction: \u201c[I\u2019m] pretty dedicated to creating better clients since then.\u201d\nThe Evil Java Application\nThis event, and everything below in this list, is much more recent, taking place in 2013. As the victim himself describes it, \u201clast night around 9PM PDT, I clicked a link to go to CoinChat[.]freetzi[.]com \u2013 and I was prompted to run java. I did (thinking this was a legitimate chatoom), and nothing happened. I closed the window and thought nothing of it. I opened my bitcoin-qt wallet approx 14 minutes later, and saw a transaction that I did NOT approve go to wallet 1Es3QVvKN1qA2p6me7jLCVMZpQXVXWPNTC for almost my entire wallet (2.07 BTC)\u201d [~$300 at the time]. This time, the wallet was encrypted, but the attacker was much more clever. The Java application that the victim had opened had also asked for additional permissions, which the victim instinctively granted, unwittingly giving the malicious program the ability to read all of his keystrokes. The application simply waited until he started typing in his wallet password, recorded the password, and then immediately proceeded to decrypt and empty out the wallet.\nThe Blockchain.info Theft\nA blockchain.info user lost 160 BTC (~$20,000) to an unknown attacker. This time, user was not careless in any obvious way; he wrote: \u201cI use the blockchain.info wallet service to manage that address. My password was a random 18 character password with punctuation, upper/lower case etc. I had two-factor authentication with Google Authenticator turned on and a second password on the account that was a random 8 characters.\u201d Rather, the problem lay with the blockchain.info mobile application. On the desktop, blockchain.info encrypts users\u2019 wallets twice; the entire wallet with the main password, and the private keys themselves with an optional second password as well. On the mobile however, for convenience only the second layer of encryption is used. In a stock Android setup, this is not a problem; the sandboxing mechanism ensures that one application\u2019s storage is not accessible by any other application. This user\u2019s phone, however, was roooted. Rooting one\u2019s phone allows the user to use powerful applications that tinker with low-level parts of the Android ecosystem, but it comes at the price of trust: any application to which the user granted root access could have potentially read the wallet file and sent it off, leaving the attacker free to crack the relatively weak 8-character second password on some kind of GPU, FPGA or cloud-based computing cluster.\nThe Costly Brainwallet Mistake\nA Bitcoin user stored 90 BTC (~$10,000) in a brain wallet \u2013 an address that, along with its corresponding private key, can be generated from a memorized password. Brainwallets can be a very secure way to store one\u2019s savings, as the information needed to recover the funds only briefly touches a computer once when the address is first generated. The problem with a brainwallet, however, is spending it. Seeking to spend 2 of his 90 BTC, this user generated the private key from his password, loaded it into the MultiBit Bitcoin client, and sent a transaction. He then deleted the MultiBit wallet file (since if the private key remained stored on a computer file it would not be much of a \u201cbrain wallet\u201d anymore). However, this proved to be a fatal mistake. MultiBit had sent the 2 BTC to its intended destination, but it also sent the other 88 BTC to a newly generated \u201cchange\u201d address. If he had been using MultiBit normally, this would have been fine; sending change to a new address is standard practice and improves privacy. Here, however, deleting the wallet afterward deleted the private key behind the new address, causing the 88 BTC to essentially be lost forever.\nThe Hidden MtGox API Key\nA Bitcoin user had $480 cleared out from their MtGox account even with two-factor authentication installed. It appears that an attacker had managed to somehow get into the account before the two-factor authentication was added, created an API key, and then used that API key to withdraw from the account two weeks later once the sum had been deposited. This is not a security flaw on MtGox\u2019s part; an API (\u201capplication programming interface\u201d) key is a password specifically intended to be used by computer programs, and the point of two-factor authentication is for the second factor (eg. a one-time password sent via text message, or a Google Authenticator application on one\u2019s phone) to be completely separate from the computer used to access the site. Thus, API keys must necessarily bypass two-factor authentication to be useful. The one thing MtGox could do is offer to clear all API keys when two-factor authentication is added or the password is changed.\nSo What Can We Do?\nAll of these attacks have their own specific countermeasures; to avoid Bitcoin wallet thefts, turn on wallet encryption; to avoid thefts from exchange accounts, use two-factor authentication (look for a \u201cGoogle Authenticator\u201d option in your exchange account\u2019s security settings) and make sure to check for API keys that were created without your permission; to avoid attackers trivially bypassing both, do not give untrusted applications excessive permissions, even at the cost of convenience, and to avoid loss, create more backups, and check them regularly.\nBut looking at how even the more responsible Bitcoin users in the above list get hacked, these events clearly show that simply telling people to be more careful is not good enough. It does not seem particularly realistic to ask the average non-technical user, or even the average technical user, to never make a mistake. Thus, what we really need in wallet security, from both users and developers, is a change in paradigm. Rather than trying to continually patch up our digital walls in an effort to make them unbreakable, what need to recognize that any particular strategy used to secure one\u2019s funds can always potentially be circumvented by a mistake on the user\u2019s part, and a mistake is guaranteed to happen eventually. From that viewpoint, the only viable strategy is obvious: defense in depth, using multiple layers of security and granularity to ensure that no single attack can cause all of our funds to get stolen \u2013 or lost. Here are some basic tips that can help:\nBasic Online Service Security \u2013 here, the multiple layers of defense are already provided, although it is your responsibility to actually use them. If you are using an exchange, make sure to (1) have a secure password, (2) turn on two-factor authentication (look for it in the security settings, and install the Google Authenticator app on your phone here), (3) make sure the email account that your exchange account is registered with has a secure password and two factor authentication, and (4) make sure you have no unauthorized API keys if you are using MtGox, and turn API access off entirely if you are using BitStamp (and do the equivalent for any other exchange).Basic Computer Security \u2013 do not download or run applications from untrusted sources; the Web of Trust addon for Firefox Chrome is a highly recommanded tool that can warn you if you are entering a shady website. Consider uninstalling Java, or at least if you see a Java application asking for permissions train yourself to click \u201cDeny\u201d. Run antivirus scans frequently, and if you catch anything consider your entire operating system infected beyond repair and reinstall.Wallet Separation \u2013 keep a separate \u201cspending wallet\u201d and a \u201csavings wallet\u201d. Your spending wallet should be a medium-security, but high-convenience setup with only a small portion of your bitcoins stored inside, and your savings wallet, containing the bulk of your funds, should be optimized for security (against theft and accidental loss) alone. The highest level of security is storing the savings wallet completely separately from your main operating system \u2013 a USB Linux distribution, a paper wallet and a brain wallet (provided you are careful with it) are all valid options.Two-of-three Schemes \u2013 two-of-three schemes are a common way of simultaneously reducing the risk of both loss and theft by adding redundancy. The btckeysplit utility can be used to split up any private key (or potentially password) into N pieces, such that any K of them (but never just K-1) can be recombined to get the original input (you choose K and N; two out of three is the simplest and most popular), and multisignature transactions provide an officially supported, and more versatile, way of doing the same thing. The three pieces or keys should be placed in completely different locations; memorizing one, writing down another and keeping a third on your computer is a good combination, and you could also give a piece to a semi-trusted third party or friend.\nDevelopers can also help \u2013 online wallets and exchanges should let customers voluntarily set low daily withdrawal limits, and a better user interface for two-of-three schemes is needed to make them more widely used. One interesting idea for a service would be an online wallet that signs multisignature transactions in exchange for some form of identity verification, essentially taking on the role of the semi-trusted third party described above.\nThere are also other developments now on the horizon; dedicated hardware USB wallets will soon come out, essentially providing a dedicated, highly secure mini-computer for making Bitcoin transactions that you can carry in your wallet. But just like wallet encryption and two-factor authentication, hardware wallets will only form part of a complete wallet security setup. In an increasingly digitized world, no technology will remove the need to make an effort to protect your digital keys, but users and developers alike can go a long way in making the Bitcoin world a safer place \u2013 users by always being mindful of security and taking advantage of the tips described above and developers by making it easier to do so.", "year": 2013, "month": 5, "day": 17}

Presentations and panel discussions featured dozens of speakers who are experts in matters of technology, business and regulation, and the topics were equally interesting; among the discussions were subjects involving cryptocurrency-based stocks, using Bitcoin for digital charity, two implementations of decentralized mixers, regulatory and security challenges and creating whole new nations. For every conceivable application to which cryptocurrencies can be put, there are at least two projects implementing it, and for every problem with Bitcoin that still remains to be solved there are at least three projects working hard on a solution. Altogether, the conference has been almost universally applauded as a huge success. As Sean's Outpost founder Jason King described it after the fact, the halls of Bitcoin 2013 were filled with a \"hopeful energy\" and excitement that he had not seen since the first conference of the World Wide Web itself.\nIndependently filmed videos from the conference are available on Youtube already, and the Bitcoin Foundation's own videos will soon be available on their website. Summaries of key announcements can be found scattered throughout the internet (some content has been posted and more will be added on our own website). Here are some of the key takeaways that I personally found important:\nBitcoin is being taken seriously\nOne observation at the conference that could be made right from the first day is just how fully the American liberty movement has embraced Bitcoin. Free State Project-associated charities and businesses are responsible for two of the conference's booths, and Free Talk Live, a popular radio show, took the opportunity to broadcast directly from the conference's center stage for three days in a row. At the nonprofit panel on Sunday, Fr33Aid's Teresa Warmke described how last month her organization had abandoned its application for non-profit status with the IRS to become an essentially Bitcoin-only organization. New Hampshire may well become the Bitcoin Kiez, or even the Israel, of the Americas with its rapid, and rabid, acceptance of the currency.\nSean's Outpost founder Jason King has now started the Bitcoin Homeless Outreach Center, rapidly expanding its operations using the currency and its associated community as an epicenter. The Electronic Frontier Foundation had agreed to accept Bitcoin days before the conference started, and another panel discussion at the conference featured the EFF's Rainey Reitman, among others, discussing the topic of regulation and financial privacy. Business attention was also very clearly present. Since the start of the month, three major Bitcoin businesses had received a total of nearly $8 million in investment: Coinbase got $5 million from Y Combinator, BitPay $2 million from Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, and BitInstant $1.5 million from the Winklevoss twins (who were, incidentally, present on the first day of the conference). At the conference itself, the Bitcoin investment group BitAngels had its first meeting. Altogether, the message is clear: Bitcoin is not a toy, it is a rapidly maturing, $1.3 billion economy that a rapidly increasing number of people are taking the plunge to base their lives around.\nBitcoin is here to stay\nOf course, the conference did include a number of discussions on some of the weaknesses of Bitcoin that still remain. Ease of use, security and regulation were three major topics that analysts inside and outside of Bitcoin cite as weaknesses, and with good reason. However, for every problem that Bitcoin panelists in the presentation rooms were discussing, in the exhibition room there were three businesses working hard to solve it. Buying and selling bitcoins too hard? Coinbase's exchange and Lamassu and RoboCoin's Bitcoin ATMs are rapidly solving the problem. Bitcoind not user-friendly enough for enterprise use? Bitsofproof is working on that. Security? Butterfly Labs' BitSafe, Slush's Trezor and BTChip are all present, and the latter was even handing out free samples. Regulation? BitInstant, Coinbase and Tradehill are all well on their way to full compliance.\nThe alternate chains, and especially Ripple, also make clear that even if Bitcoin itself, for whatever reason, happens to falter, other cryptocurrencies will quickly take its place. The value of the Ripple currency's total money supply is already higher than that of Bitcoin, and currencies like Litecoin are seeing their value grow even more rapidly than Bitcoin. Bitcoin alone may have fallen to half of its peak since the crash, but a balanced portfolio of Bitcoin, Litecoin and XRP is now stronger than ever.\nBitcoin is already introducing alternate centers of power into this world\nEspecially in the United States, from watching mainstream television and media one gets a very particular stereotype of how a wealthy bsiness owner is supposed to look: a 40+ year old white male, with a large body over 180cm tall, and always wearing a suit. For those who have not been steeped in Silicon Valley culture, at first Bitcoin 2013 was even slightly unsettling in terms of how quickly and utterly that stereotype was dispelled. Even the most prominent business owners were surprisingly average in weight and height, more likely under 25 than over, and equipped with a T-shirt as often as anything else.\nThis observation is mote than a minor detail; more than anything else, it clearly shows how Bitcoin is enabling individuals and businesses to succeed that would never make it elsewhere. In the \"real world\", studies repeatedly show that factors like race and height can be even more important than any measure of the objective quality of a candidate in predicting success and failure. In the world of Bitcoin, wealth is generated from behind a computer screen, and many (although certainly not all) of these biases simply disappear. As the saying goes, on the internet nobody knows you're a dog.\nOne of the reasons why wealth in the world in general is so centralized is that producing it requires not just talents and ideas, but also contacts - specifically, contact with the organizations that already have it. Being able to offer the lowest prices to one's customers requires knowing the right people and having the skills to negotiate the best deals, and among those businesses that seek to interface between Bitcoin and the world outside this remains painfully clear. Inside of Bitcoin, at least in this early phase of development, product is all that matters, allowing people who were nobodies before to suddenly enter the limelight through talent, hard work or even simple random luck. \nWhat's more, this new wealth is physically, and socially, decentralized; although many firms now are located in Silicon Valley, many more are from regions as diverse as Florida, New Hampshire, France, Israel and China, and as these businesses grow local communities around the world will benefit. This may well prove to be a one-off effect, but even still it can be appreciated as part of a larger process of positive disruption through technological change. And in that regard it is very significant; the only other technology that has had a similar effect in the past thirty years is perhaps the internet itself.\nIt's more than just Bitcoin\nThe topics at the conference were not just about Bitcoin itself. Perhaps the most commonly discussed alternate application of the underlying idea of cryptographically secured blockchains was that of smart property and crypto-stocks. There are now actually three distinct ways to implement both of these ideas in the works: OpenTransactions, Ripple and colored coins. OpenTransactions relies on centralized servers, although cheating on the part of servers is detectable, but it offers full anonymity through a construction known as blind signatures. Ripple is an alternative currency system that offers the ability for anyone to issue their own currencies, with features like a decentralized exchange built in. The main targeted use case is currencies representing fiat currencies like the US dollar, but making a currency to act as a stock or even to represent a piece of property is entirely possible. Colored coins provide a way to accomplish the same thing from inside the Bitcoin blockchain itself.\nThe most radical idea of all, however, has nothing to do with Bitcoin itself - at least not directly. The conference saw two distinct projects seeking to accomplish what can only be described doing for the offline and the political what Bitcoin did to the financial: creating entirely new, politically independent, city-states. The first of these, Blueseed, will work by maintaining a ship close to California just outside the international waters line, and will be particularly targeted to solving the difficulties in US immigration. Both employees and entrepreneurs interested in working in Silicon Valley face an uphill battle getting the visa to do so legally, and the process often takes years. By working on Blueseed, it will become very easy to circumvent the problem, and Blueseed residents will still be able to frequently visit Silicon Valley itself through a half-hour ferry - on a personal or business visa, which is much easier to obtain. The zone will also be particularly attractive to Bitcoin businesses seeking to remain easily accessible to US customers but avoid onerous US money transmitter regulation. The second, yet unnamed, will be a full-scale, Manhattan-sized Hong Kong-like free zone in a yet undisclosed country in the Caribbean, and the promise to the Bitcoin community that the project's ambassador Edan Yago has brought is that the zone's legal system will be specifically designed for cryptocurrencies right from the start. Exactly what that entails, well, watch the presentations to find out.\nThe overarching theme of the conference is this: 2013 is the year of Bitcoin's coming of age. In 2012, we were still, as Reuters put it, \"the city traders' anarchic new toy\". Now, we have highly skilled and well-equipped teams of not just programmers, but also businessmen, investors and lawyers, ready to take on the challenges of finally pushing out Bitcoin to large-scale, real-world use. Bitcoin is increasingly carving out a role not just as a project in itself, but as part of a larger movement for technological and financial freedom and privacy around the world. Twenty years ago, ideas like those discussed at the conference were the topic of science fiction; today, we are already living them. Welcome to the future.", "year": 2013, "month": 5, "day": 22}
{"title": "BitInstant: We Have Money Transmitter Licenses in 30 States", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitinstant-we-have-money-transmitter-licenses-in-30-states-1369188693/", "birthday": "May 21, 2013  10:11 PM EST", "date": "2013-05-22 03:11:00", "content": "Regulation has been a hot topic in the Bitcoin community since the FINCEN guidance in March, and in the Bitcoin conference that took place this past weekend an entire quarter of the conference was dedicated to economic and regulatory issues. The guidance evoked strong feelings of both relief and uncertainty throughout the Bitcoin community; although ordinary Bitcoin users are now almost certainly clear of regulation, a fact that has allowed the Humble Bundle and the Electronic Frontier Foundation to feel comfortable accepting the currency, Bitcoin exchanges will now likely be required to have money transmitter licenses in all 48 states to operate across the country \u2013 an extremely onerous procedure that has repeatedly stymied even businesses outside the Bitcoin space. Many figures have been thrown around as to just how much that process costs; a common understanding was that it takes millions of dollars of legal effort and surety bonds, and Jeff Berwick said in his resignation from the Robocoin Bitcoin ATM project that the main obstacle too US participation was \u201ca $25 million \u201cinsurance bond\u201d necessary as being deemed a \u201cmoney transmitter\u201d in the US.\u201d\nHowever, a deeper examination into the issue at play shows that things are not nearly so bleak. The requirements for becoming a money transmitter largely fall into two separate categories: bureaucratic legal effort and surety bonds. With surety bonds, a common requirement is that you need to be insured for 2% of the total volume that you plan to be processing over the next year. If you go over, you need to buy more surety bonds. The cost is thus less prohibitive for small businesses, although there are usually minimums; the Florida regulations specify a minimum of $50,000. In order to get insured for this amount, most insurers charge about 2%, so a money transmitter in Florida would need to pay at least $1000 per year in order to operate. Other states have similar requirements, and altogether the minimum amounts add up to about $7 million. Of course, one also needs to convince surety bond brokers to deal with Bitcoin exchanges, although some are appearing now specifically to serve the legal industry. The other onerous burden is the legal effort. \u201cThe more you spend,\u201d Tradehill\u2019s Ryan Singer explains, \u201cthe better lawyers you can get and the faster you get your applications.\u201d You can spend only a medium amount of money (in business terms; for a basement startup, it is still very much prohibitive) and get the licenses in several years, or you can spend more to get them faster. Tradehill currently has two lawyers per engineer hired to work on compliance issues.\nJust how far along to 48 are leading businesses? The answer from every major exchange in the US (except perhaps MtGox\u2019s US subsidiary) is, surprisingly, quite far. BitInstant\u2019s Alex Waters has even provided a precise figure: 30 states. BitInstant\u2019s progress in getting these licenses is particularly impressive because, technically, they do not even need them; because the company only acts as an intermediary for other exchanges, they are actually classified as a payment processor, a category for which there is a specific legal exemption. However, BitInstant nevertheless wants to be on top of things. \u201cWe\u2019ve been registered as an MSB [money services business, the federal license for money transmission] since 2011,\u201d Waters explains. \u201cWe take finance and regulatory issues seriously \u2026 we\u2019re doing things the way they should be done.\u201d\nThis should qualify as another piece of highly positive news for Bitcoin. Although regulators certainly are watching Bitcoin exchanges, as the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s recent seizure of MtGox\u2019s Dwolla account clearly shows, no other major Bitcoin business has yet been caught in government crosshairs. Furthermore, the MtGox seizure was justified solely by federal law, which MtGox was not compliant with but which every other major Bitcoin exchange has been compliant with for a long time \u2013 BitInstant, as mentioned above, has been a licensed money services business since 2011. In March, there may have been a public perception that exchanges were suddenly scrambling to meet the new requirements. In reality, however, the exchanges have been working on acquiring these licenses since long before the guidance was out, and the day may not be too far away when at least these legal worries are behind us.", "year": 2013, "month": 5, "day": 22}
{"title": "MtGox\u2019s Dwolla Account Seized For Unlicensed Money Transmission", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/mtgoxs-dwolla-account-seized-1368760437/", "birthday": "May 16, 2013  11:13 PM EST", "date": "2013-05-17 04:13:00", "content": "The world's largest Bitcoin exchange, MtGox, had its account with Dwolla closed down by the order of the Department of Homeland Security. The fact was first discovered on Monday when OKCupid cofounder Chris Coyne posted a screenshot of an email from Dwolla saying that his deposit to MtGox could not be processed because of \"recent court orders by the Department of Homeland Security and US District Court for the District of Maryland seizing the account of Mutum Sigillum LLC (Mt. Gox)\" The next day, DHS officials provided the warrant used to shut down the account, exposing the reason why the shutdown was made: MtGox was operating an \"unlicensed money transmitting business.\"\nGovernment attention on Bitcoin exchanges has picked up after the US government's financial regulator FINCEN released a guidance report expressing its position on digital currencies: in summary, people and organizations that use Bitcoin to buy and sell goods and services are in the clear, but Bitcoin exchanges are regulated as money transmitters. However, the underlying law is more complex than this. Money transmitters are regulated under federal law (specifically 31 USC 5330), which requires them to get a money services business (MSB) license, as well as additional state laws in 48 states, which require a separate money transmitter (MT) license in each state. The state-level regulations are much more onerous; it is estimated that getting all 48 licenses requires millions of dollars in surety bonds. The FINCEN guidance was federal, and so directly affects the state of federal law only; for state governments it is merely a suggestion, and so it is up to individual states to determine exactly how their local money transmitter laws will apply to Bitcoin exchanges. But there is also another federal law prohibiting a money transmitting business from operating without a license, 18 USC 1960, which piggybacks off of both 31 USC 5330 and state law for its definition of money transmission. 18 USD 1960 b1 reads:\n the term \u201cunlicensed money transmitting business\u201d means a money transmitting business which affects interstate or foreign commerce in any manner or degree and\u2014 (A) is operated without an appropriate money transmitting license in a State where such operation is punishable as a misdemeanor or a felony under State law ... (B) fails to comply with the money transmitting business registration requirements under section 5330 of title 31, United States Code ...\nHowever, it appears that in this case state law did not enter the picture at all. \"According to FinCEN records on May 6, 2013,\" the warrant reads, \"neither Mt. Gox nor the subsidiary, Mutum Sigillum LLC, is registered as a Money Service Business.\" Thus, it is under federal law that this seizure warrant is making its case. The warrant also states:\n As part of the account opening process, Wells Fargo required Karpeles and Mutum Sigillum LLC to complete a \"Money Services Business (MSB) Accounts, Identification of an MSB Customer\" form. That document was completed on May 20, 2011 and identified Mutum Sigillum LLC as a business not engaged in money services. The application asks several questions; to include, \"Do you deal in or exchange currency for your customer?\" and \"Does your business accept funds from customers and send the funds based on customers' instructions (Money Transmitter)?\" Karpeles answered these questions \"no,\" indicating that Mutum Sigillum LLC does not deal in or exchange money, and that it does not send funds based on customer instructions.\nThe document then proceeds to argue that MtGox's activity of processing Dwolla withdrawals constitutes \"accept[ing] funds from customers and send the funds based on customers' instructions\", and so MtGox (or rather its subsidiary) is in fact a money transmitter,. At this point, we do not know what Karpeles was thinking when he put those answers on the form; perhaps this was simply an attempt to fly \"under the radar\", or perhaps MtGox will have a legal argument up their sleeve as to why the warrant's claim is incorrect.\nThe fact that state law did not enter the picture is a very positive sign; other Bitcoin exchanges and intermediaries in the United States, such as Coinbase, Tradehill/Prime and BitInstant, all have MSB licenses, and so are not likely to be immediately targeted by the federal government after this. Until these exchanges come up with the required millions of dollars in capital to get money transmitter licenses in 48 states, or the exact situation of state money transmitter laws with regard to Bitcoin is clarified, no one is entirely free and clear, but with a combination of luck, prudence and willingness to proceed toward resolving the remaining legal issues as quickly as possible the major exchanges may still avoid regulatory trouble entirely. If state regulators do start coming down hard on Bitcoin exchanges very soon, the other option is to do what Justin Oh's Bitcoin ATM is considering doing and what Bitcoin Central did already: partnering with established institutions that already have the required licenses.\nAs for MtGox itself, this incident means the loss of one of MtGox's major funding methods, making the exchange more difficult to buy and sell bitcoins with. BitStamp and BTC-E, the second and third largest exchanges, both do not work with Dwolla, so this removes one of MtGox's advantages over these platforms. This is in fact the fourth item in a series of bad news for the exchange in the past month; the mishaps during the price crash of April 10-12, MtGox's recent removal of the ability to place orders without immediately having the funds to fill them on April 17 and the Coinlab lawsuit on May 2 have all struck the exchange's usefulness and reputation. However, altogether these misfortunes appear to be only further proving MtGox's resilience; the exchange has been responsible for about 75% of all exchange volume over the past thirty days. Only time will tell whether MtGox will be able to recover its legal situation in the United States (perhaps by resolving its differences with Coinlab and finally executing their customer transfer agreement) and bring Dwolla transfers back up.", "year": 2013, "month": 5, "day": 17}

A search for \u201cBitcoin\u201d on the foundation\u2019s website returns a maze of headlines going back to 2010, leading every-which-way. Fortunately, the big announcement made last week is good news: EFF Will Accept Bitcoins to Support Digital Liberty.\nThe EFF is as much a part of Internet history as \u201cdotcom.\u201d It was founded in 1990, very early in the era of the consumer-based Internet, and the Foundation has proven to be a powerful ally and force to be reckoned with, fighting for users\u2019 rights to privacy, security and freedom of speech. When the organization first started to accept Bitcoin donations it lasted for roughly six months before they backed away in June 2011. The reasons given boil down to the fact that regulations regarding the exchange of digital currencies to fiat were undefined, this uncertainty has been somewhat reduced with the release of the FinCEN guidelines in March of this year.\nWhen the Foundation announced that they would stop accepting Bitcoin donations to avoid stepping into the murky regulatory environment around exchanging bitcoins for fiat, and calling it a day, they promised to give \u201cthe Bitcoins that have been accumulated, or that may accumulate in the future, in the account set up in our name to the Bitcoin Faucet, so that they can continue to circulate in the community.\u201d\nThe recent good news comes with a caveat (in bold text) \u201cEFF is not endorsing Bitcoin\u201d and they go on to explain how the use of any payment processor is not endorsement of said processor. In fact, the third and final reason given for backing away from Bitcoin in the first place was that \u201cPeople were misconstruing our acceptance of Bitcoins as an endorsement of Bitcoin.\u201d The withdrawal statement goes on to point out, \u201cWhile we\u2019ve been following the Bitcoin movement with a great degree of interest, EFF has never endorsed Bitcoin.\u201d\nTwo years is an eternity in the Bitcoin world. At the end of June 2011 when EFF started running the Faucet it was two weeks after the $31 all-time-high and 1 BTC was selling for $16.50 on its way down to $2.25. Since then there has been a monumental swell of investors, entrepreneurs and activists becoming passionate about Bitcoin, generating amazing new ideas, products, services and entire companies that are spreading freedom and economic growth that shows no sign of slowing. The payment processor that EFF is using to receive donations and exchange them expediently, BitPay, is a perfect example of how far the Bitcoin ecosystem has come in that time, it did not launch until July 2011.\nThe EFF summarized the events of the last two years with a statement that bodes well for the path that Bitcoin is on, \u201cSince then, we\u2019ve been watching the public debate around Bitcoins, seeing the ecosystem develop around them, and conducting our own research on the possible legal issues.\u201d\nA lot of the EFF\u2019s victories in the past have taken place in the courts, so it will be interesting to see what role the Foundation will play when the day comes that Bitcoin users are faced with prosecution or that the freedom to use digital currency is threatened by blanket legislation. The EFF could prove to be a powerful ally in a possible knock-down-drag-out crytpo-currency court battle. While this is clearly not an EFF endorsement of Bitcoin as a product or service, a decentralized technology that offers proof of authenticity with pseudo-anonymity could be a valuable tool in the future of free speech. There will hopefully be more details to come from EFF\u2019s on-going investigation, shining more light on which of Bitcoin\u2019s strengths and shortcomings most concern the foundation.", "year": 2013, "month": 5, "day": 24}

Budovsky had been arrested before in 2006, when he and Vladimir Kats were arrested for operating Gold Age, a digital currency exchanger which the US federal government deemed to be a money transmitting business, without a license. However, they received probation, and Budovsky continued to operate Liberty Reserve. This time, the underlying cause of the arrest was money laundering; \u201cBudovsky\u2019s businesses in Costa Rica apparently were financed by using money from child pornography websites and drug trafficking,\u201d BehindMLM writes.\nIn 2011, Liberty Reserve, together with Dwolla, was one of the main methods of moving money into Bitcoin exchanges to buy bitcoins, and can be credited as being one of the chief enablers of the Bitcoin economy\u2019s early growth at the time. The key feature that LR and Dwolla offered was the lack of chargebacks, meaning that exchanges could use these services safely without fear of a fraudulent customer buying depositing USD, buying and withdrawing bitcoins, and charging the USD back. Dwolla introduced chargebacks without warning in early 2012, suddenly costing one Bitcoin exchange, Tradehill, nearly $100,000 in chargeback fraud. As of May 2013, a lawsuit from Tradehill to recover the money is still underway, with little progress having been made. The loss of this alternative maintained Liberty Reserve\u2019s popularity for some time, but since then it has considerably decreased in importance in the Bitcoin community. MtGox has continued to offer it as a popular deposit option up to this day, but other services, like OKPay, have grown to fill the space, and other Bitcoin exchanges have added more convenient means of buying bitcoins such as cash deposit and bank transfer.\nThus, on the whole, this may help Bitcoin more than hurt it. Many businesses that operate in a high-chargeback-fraud setting have stayed with the USD or Euro by using payment processors that attempt to be chargeback-free, but what the downfall of first Dwolla then Liberty Reserve shows is that, in general, chargeback-free on the internet is a lie; businesses only stay chargeback-free until they are either shut down outright due to the black and grey market activity that chargeback-free services also necessarily attract or a sufficiently large crisis happens that forces them to change their policies. Somehow, something eventually forces everyone\u2019s hand. Except Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin does not depend on any government or corporation, there is no way for anyone to force the system to bend to their will, and so it will remain chargeback-free for as long as it has enough people mining it to defend against attackers. And if that does happen, alternative cryptocurrencies like Ripple will take its place, substituting in a globally distributed network of trust for mining.\nBehindMLM\u2019s article on the shutdown mentions how Liberty Reserve is being used by multi-level marketing (MLM) companies. MLM is a marketing strategy in which companies hire, usually on a very informal, \u201csign up here and start right away\u201d basis, people to market their product and compensate them for not only sales that they themselves make but also a percentage of commissions earned by people they recruit. This is an industry that needs to pay usually very small amounts of money to millions of people around the world, and which is easily susceptible to chargeback fraud \u2013 one can simply sell a product to oneself ten times, get the commissions, and then charge the ten sales back. With Liberty Reserve down, they may be forced to move over to Bitcoin instead. Multi-level marketing is only one example; there are many industries that could benefit greatly from a secure chargeback-free method of money transfer like Bitcoin. Perhaps this event will convince them to finally take the plunge and switch to it.", "year": 2013, "month": 5, "day": 25}

According to the cache, the announcement was taken down sometime after 20 May.\nOKPAY\u2019s trust in the viability of bitcoin in their system may have been shaken after an OKPAY user reported on bitcointalk.org that they had successfully double-spent over 211 BTC to OKPAY and a seperate address controlled by the user during the block chain fork of 12 March 2013. The same user also reported that an approximately 65 BTC he had sent separately to OKPAY was not successfully credited to the approriate account. Somewhat of a standoff ensued, but was resolved with OKPAY refunding the 65 BTC only after the customer returned the double-spent 211 BTC. OKPAY support staff confirmed the situation on a bitcointalk.org forum thread started by the double-spender.\nWith their latest announcement leaving no indication as to if or when service will be restored, bitcoiners are left wondering whether the stoppage is a temporary measure to provide time for OKPAY to implement solutions to problems that plague the interaction between bitcoin and existing financial networks, or whether the company has decided that the effort required to use bitcoin is beyond their willingness or ability to integrate it into their system.", "year": 2013, "month": 5, "day": 28}

It joins a stable of currencies that includes the Russian and Belorussian Rubles, the Euro, and Vietnamese Dong, as well as gold certificates.\nBy virtue of the currencies it includes, WebMoney\u2019s users are primarily located in Europe and Asia. Customers use what are termed \u201cpurses\u201d to hold each specific currency. Each currency has its own WebMoney-specific moniker based on a combination of the currency, and what payment method is used. WMR is refers to a bearers check in Russian Rubles, WMU for bank account claims in Ukranian Hryvnia, and now WMX for bitcoin.\nRetailers and service providers, both online and offline, use WebMoney as a payment processor, with comparisons drawn to PayPal in the USA. One distinction, however, is that WebMoney does not provide a chargeback service, making it simpler to accept the notoriously chargeback-allergic Bitcoin into its fold. WebMoney\u2019s services are used by mobile phone companies, internet bookstores, and internet service providers, among others.\nWebMoney utilizes different \u201cguarantors\u201d to underwrite its transactions into each currency. The underwriters are responsible for the deposit and withdrawal of funds for the transfer system. Shell companies are often used for liability purposes (Amstar Holdings Limited, Ukrainian Guarantee Agency, LLC, etc), but the list of underwriters does include the Vietnamese bank VietAbank.\nThe underwriter for bitcoin in the WebMoney system is the British Virgin Islands based INDX Transactions Ltd, whose director is listed as Marea Jean O\u2019Toole. O\u2019Toole was included in a November 2012 Guardian piece detailing a joint Guardian/ International Consortium of Investigative Journalists(ICIJ) investigation of \u201cnominee\u201d offshore banking directors. The article shows O\u2019Toole as being based in Indian Ocean island nation of Mauritius while heading 37 companies in the British Virgin Islands, 152 in the UK, 10 in Ireland, and 3 in New Zealand for a total of 202, with the caveat that there are likely more records that their investigation did not uncover.\nThe Guardian/ICIJ investigation indicated that while the practice of using paying an individual to register as head of a company to protect the privacy of it\u2019s owners is not illegal under UK law, its overuse can be a problem. It was discovered that 28 individuals, of which O\u2019Toole is one, are connected to more than 21,500 companies worldwide. The most prolific name on the list, James Grassick, has 4,196 companies attached to his name, the bulk of which are registered in Ireland.\nThe high numbers displayed in the report may show not only the scale of this phenomenon, but could also be indicative of the reaction by some businesses to both comply with complex regulation while at the same time mitigating some of the intent behind that regulation.\nWhile this raises more questions about the existing financial system and WebMoney than it does about bitcoin, it does show that bitcoin is being integrated into an already well established financial realm. It also raises curiosity over exactly who is underwriting WebMoney\u2019s WMX bitcoin transactions.", "year": 2013, "month": 5, "day": 29}
{"title": "Bitcointalk At War With Ad Blockers", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcointalk-at-war-with-ad-blockers-1369691906/", "birthday": "May 27, 2013  5:58 PM EST", "date": "2013-05-27 22:58:00", "content": "Over the past day or so, an ongoing arms race between the popular Bitcoin forum Bitcointalk and EasyList, by far the most popular filter list for the ad blocking extension Adblock Plus, appears to have reached a climax. In the recent past, Bitcointalk ads have generally slipped through ad blocking filters because they were relatively unobtrusive, appearing as small blobs of text in between the first post and the rest of a forum thread. On May 20, however, a Bitcointalk member posted that Adblock Plus was now blocking the ads. Within three hours, Bitcointalk operator Theymos posted the following:\nNot anymore. WinkThey tried this once before with the same simple blocking method. I have a bunch of obfuscation techniques in mind if they try anything more fancy. It\u2019s much more difficult for them to block the forum\u2019s ads because they\u2019re 100% inline and not images.\nOver the next few days, it appears that the EasyList maintainers managed to break through Theymos\u2019 obfuscation multiple times, and each time Theymos found a new way to circumvent their strategies. On May 25, Theymos posted a longer update saying:\nLet\u2019s see \u2019em block this. There\u2019s now a random number of invisible \u201cposts\u201d before and after the ad, and they\u2019re all (I think) indistinguishable from real posts if you\u2019re limited to just CSS selectors. Hopefully the filter maintainers aren\u2019t careless or they\u2019ll end up blocking random posts.\nAt this point, however, Theymos proved to be very wrong. Theymos made a post on May 26, entitled \u201cAdblock Plus censoring posts\u201d, saying:\nThe Adblock Plus EasyList maintainers couldn\u2019t block the forum\u2019s ads, so they just blocked the links in the ads everywhere on the forum. So that\u2019s why you might see posts censored like this:At Private Internet Access, we provide multi-gigabit tier-1 access points to our private global VPN (virtual private network).Why VPN? Please visit our website, , at .We look forward to providing you the highest quality .There\u2019s nothing I can change in the forum\u2019s HTML to stop this. This isn\u2019t a side-effect of my anti-ABP code. If you don\u2019t want posts censored, you need to disable ABP (or just these filters) on bitcointalk.org. You can complain about it here.\nThe incident is interesting because it poignantly, and hilariously, shows at just how high a level of abstraction modern commercial cyber-warfare can take place. Here, the battlefield is forum readers\u2019 eyes, the munitions are lines of Javascript code inserted into files are ultimately downloaded and run on users\u2019 browsers, and the civilian casualties are readers and users of the forum. In a normal war, individual battles take place in one of the countries whose government is a combatant; here, users are continuing to voluntarily use Bitcointalk and Adblock Plus, and so all of the \u201ccivilian casualties\u201d involved are essentially citizens of both \u201ccountries\u201d at the same time \u2013 where citizenship is defined as having a habit of asking one\u2019s browser to ask the \u201ccountry\u2019s\u201d web server to send their browser data representing a web page (or an ad-blocking script) via the hypertext transfer protocol.\nIt is important to note that Adblock Plus does have a profit motive here; the company maintains a list of \u201cacceptable ads\u201d that they allow to pass through their filters (although there is a setting for users to block them), and although inclusion to the list is \u201cfree for websites and small businesses\u201d they have been known to charge for it. However, this may be the \u201cleast bad\u201d solution the site\u2019s owners can come up with; it allows them to continue providing a service valuable to millions of people for free, all at the cost of a slight (and even optional!) loss of neutrality. Nevertheless, website owners have good reason to dislike it, and so events like these are only going to increase in the decades to come. The economics and game theory of the internet is proving to be a field that we have only begun to explore.", "year": 2013, "month": 5, "day": 27}

This iteration in the Bitcoin-mining-as-virus trend is really only unique because of the speed and method with which it's spreading itself as well as its relative immunity to virus scanners.While early reports have this malware spreading at 2,000 clicks per hour, the infection rate may be somewhat lower. To the best of our knowledge, this malware can't magically infect your computer just from clicking a link - like most Skype malware, the link goes to a file which must be downloaded and executed by the user. This means that anyone who doesn't fall for the old \"funnypicture.jpg.exe\" trick will register as a click but won't be infected, though nefarious parties always seem have new tricks up their sleeves to trick even seasoned veterans.Once infected, this virus begins CPU mining on the infected system. Yes, CPU mining.Inexplicably, this most modern of Bitcoin malware is using the oldest and least profitable method of Bitcoin mining possible. Even with huge numbers of compromised computers it's unlikely that CPU mining is earning this particular evil-doer much money at all. This move seems especially foolish when malware already exists that uses the much more profitable GPU of infected systems to mine.Indeed, this new malware seems to lack most of the features we've come to expect from Bitcoin-based malware: It runs at a high priority, so users will notice it quickly as their systems slow to a crawl and it requires manual action on the part of the user to become infected, ensuring it can't possibly reach peak efficiency. The only thing this seems to have going for it is that it's not picked up by most of the major virus scanners - yet. Given that most virus scanners use a sort of fingerprint of known malware to do their thing, there's usually a brief period like this for every piece of malicious code. Assuming the rest of this malware lives up (or down) to its already-established reputation, it's only a matter of time before every virus scanner in town can find and kill it.The good news in all of this is that, slow and drama-filled though it may be, the beginning of the ASIC era of Bitcoin mining is likely to raise mining difficulty so high that this sort of thing is unlikely to continue. In the meantime, well, botnets are still evil and all but I suppose I'd rather see them securing the network than sending spam.", "year": 2013, "month": 4, "day": 13}
{"title": "Introducing Carbon Wallet", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/introducing-carbon-wallet-1367863785/", "birthday": "May 6, 2013  2:09 PM EST", "date": "2013-05-06 19:09:00", "content": "Carbon Wallet, a new service seeking to be the next great innovation in secure online wallets, is launching today. Currently, there are two major types of online wallet: server-side controlled wallets and client-side controlled wallets. In a server-side wallet (eg. Coinbase), the actual wallet is controlled by a server which independently maintains all of its\u2019 users like a bank account, and in a client-side wallet there is an actual fully-functional Bitcoin wallet operating inside the user\u2019s browser, and the server only holds encrypted backups of each user\u2019s wallet \u2013 to which only the user knows the decryption key. Carbon Wallet is adding a third paradigm to this mix: the server holds no backups at all, and the wallet is instead deterministically regenerated from the user\u2019s password each time the client loads.\nReconstructing an entire Bitcoin wallet from nothing more than a password may seem like a magical feat, but in reality it is quite feasible. Essentially, a wallet is made up of two parts: private keys, and transaction information. Private keys are the secret numbers that let owners of Bitcoin addresses sign transactions to spend money from them, and the transaction information that wallets need is essentially how much money they have, and the content of the individual transactions that sent the money to them. The Bitcoin Wiki describes a number of ways to generate a potentially infinite set of private keys from a single root seed; the simplest one to explain relies on a cryptographic hash function also used elsewhere in Bitcoin called SHA256. Essentially, SHA256 can take anything as an input, and uses a series of highly chaotic transformations to generate a seemingly random 256-bit number as an output \u2013 exactly the right format for a Bitcoin private key. The private key generation algorithm is simple: private key 1 = SHA256(password+\u201d1\u2033), private key 2 = SHA256(password+\u201d2\u2033), and so on, and there exists an algorithm to generate the corresponding Bitcoin address given a private key. The mechanism used by Carbon Wallet is more complicated, replicating the one used internally by Electrum, but it shares the same ability to generate as many addresses as the user requires. Transaction information, just like in the popular client-side wallet blockchain.info, is simply downloaded with the help of the Carbon Wallet servers.\nCurrently, Carbon Wallet does not let users choose their own passwords; it instead relies on twelve-word \u201cpassphrases\u201d of the same format as Electrum wallets. If you do not want to create your own twelve-word passphrase from Electrum\u2019s 1700-word dictionary, Carbon Wallet can create new passphrases for you; \u201cnaked goose realize except concrete attack strange tightly thorn note memory church\u201d is one example of a passphrase that Carbon Wallet generated.\nThe question is, will Carbon Wallet be actually more secure than its alternatives? On the one hand, this does significantly reduce the level of involvement that the server has in the Bitcoin wallet\u2019s use. On the other hand, however, the main weakness of blockchain.info \u2013 namely, the fact that its operators are theoretically capable of introducing malicious code into the client to, for example, immediately empty a user\u2019s wallet upon launch, is just as present in Carbon Wallet. Blockchain.info has provided a solution to the problem in the form of a Firefox and Chrome extension, and Carbon Wallet will soon implement a similar feature, but in this regard the security of the two models remains exactly the same.\nBut there are a number of ways in which Carbon Wallet\u2019s model does win out. The first is reliability. Even if the Carbon Wallet servers go down, users can simply convert their Carbon Wallet password into a seed for Electrum, and they will then have an Electrum wallet with all of the same addresses. With blockchain.info, users must either take advantage of blockchain.info\u2019s email or Dropbox wallet backup feature or risk losing access to their wallets if, for whatever reason, the site disappears or all copies of the database are erased. Another advantage is portability; anyone can make their own Carbon Wallet-compatible wallet with superior features or a better interface, and Carbon Wallet users will be free to simply hop between whatever providers they want at a moment\u2019s notice; because the wallet is deterministically generated from nothing but their password, every provider will be able to give the user access to their money in an instant.\nThere are several features that Carbon Wallet will add in the future. One is the ability to store a long password in local browser storage, and then use a shorter password to decrypt it. This would also help mitigate the brute force guessing issue, and would be necessary when Carbon Wallet expands into mobile applications, as it is very inconvenient to type in a genuinely secure password on a smartphone. The wallet will also soon add at the very least a \u201cvalidator\u201d extension to protect against someone hacking the Carbon Wallet servers and secretly inserting malicious code into the client that ultimately gets delivered to the user\u2019s browser. Support for mobile devices and QR code support is also a high priority. For those interested in what this new model of wallet storage that Carbon Wallet has to offer, the wallet is now available for use at http://carbonwallet.com.", "year": 2013, "month": 5, "day": 6}
{"title": "Interview with Amagi Metals\u2019 Stephen Macaskill", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/interview-with-amagi-metals-stephen-macaskill-1365636869/", "birthday": "Apr 10, 2013  7:34 PM EST", "date": "2013-04-11 00:34:00", "content": "Initially, Amagi Metals had joined the Bitcoin community with little fanfare. When four-year-old company first started accepting payments in Bitcoin in December 2012, it made no attempt to advertise the fact; indeed, the first time that the company received any significant attention from the Bitcoin community at all was when a visitor stumbled upon the site and created a Reddit forum thread in January. Even after that, for the first three months the Bitcoin option saw little usage, and after the forum thread came and went most of the Bitcoin world did not know that the company even existed.\nHowever, behind the scenes word soon began to spread as a number of factors turned in Amagi\u2019s favor. First of all, the Bitcoin community has grown massively in the last few months. Public attention on Bitcoin is through the roof, and nearly every business in the Bitcoin economy has seen massive spikes in usage. Second, the precious metals sector of the Bitcoin economy has shown itself to be ripe for competition. For over a year, Coinabul has been by far the dominant precious metals seller in the Bitcoin community, but it has been criticized for relatively high prices, and in the past month in particular the company suffered two major setbacks. At the beginning of March Coinabul\u2019s reputation was shaken by a public relations mishap in which the company refused to refund an insured silver shipment that had failed to deliver because the insurance company failed to refund them, and two weeks later one of its two main employees, Jon Homlquist, left the company to work on BitcoinStore full time. Although Coinabul is still stronger than ever, these three factors together have prompted an increasing number of users to look for alternatives.\nFortunately, Amagi stepped in at just the right time. On March 14, the company announced that its total Bitcoin volume had reached $50,000, and three weeks later that figure was up to $175,000. Since then, volume has increased to an average of about $20,000 to $50,000 per day, and just today Amagi\u2019s Stephen Macaskill reported that Bitcoin sales have exceeded $220,000 in the past 24 hours \u2013 transforming Amagi into one of the largest merchants in the Bitcoin community overnight.\n\nStephen Macaskill is excited to be a part of the rapidly growing Bitcoin community, and has agreed to give Bitcoin Magazine an interview.\n1. Tell us a little about the company. When was Amagi Metals first created, who were the people originally behind it, and why did you decide to start a precious metals company?\nAmagi Metals was started by a friend of mine as a hobby to collect and sell coins and base metals. It was started as an eBay store back in 2008. His hobby turned profitable and paid for his college tuition. I saw a lot of potential in the business and he wanted to follow other ventures. So I bought the company from him and rebranded it as Amagi Metals. I chose the name because the 4,000 year old Sumerian cuneiform symbol amagi is the first known human representation of the concept of liberty. I think financial responsibility is important for a free society. Unfortunately the simple lessons that our grandparents taught us to manage our money have been lost. So my goal is to promote financial responsibility and sound money, so that we may live in a freer world.\n2. How did you first find out about Bitcoin, and why did you decide to start accepting it?\nI first heard about bitcoins from the libertarian community around 2010 when I was still in school. A friend called me one day in late 2012 and suggested that I start taking bitcoins. It didn\u2019t take much convincing after that to accept bitcoins because I was already intrigued with the bitcoin experiment. So we started accepting bitcoins about a week later. It has been an exciting few months for us in the bitcoin community, to say the least.\n3. What would you say are some of the important ways in which your company distinguishes itself from other previous metals sellers?\nWe focus on financial education and the promotion of sound money, free markets, and free minds. Some other precious metals companies may touch on those subjects, however they do not actively engage in the ideas of individual liberty paralleled with owning precious metals.There are only a few reputable precious metal companies that accept bitcoins. Of those companies, we have the lowest prices and are comparable to the big names such as APMEX.Our philosophy is also a little different from some of the big companies you may have heard of. We see gold as money, not as an investment, other companies advertise gold as an investment. I am referring to an investment as something you buy, wait for it to go up in value, and sell, for a profit. However we do not see gold and silver like that. Unless used as a currency, we think you should buy and hold gold and silver forever in the hopes that you never have to use it. Precious metals are used as an insurance policy, or hedge against inflation and economic turmoil and to protect your actual investments, such as stocks. \n4. Where in the world do you ship to? If you ship outside the United States, what are your shipping fees, for both US and international, and how long does it take for shipments to get through?\nWe ship worldwide, however we do not ship to every country. USPS does not allow shipping of precious metals to some countries and other countries cannot be insured by insurance provider, so we do not ship to them. Shipping costs vary depending on location, the value, and weight of the metals. Domestic shipments generally run between $2-40, and international shipments run between $5-200.Domestic shipments take 3-5 business days to arrive after your order has shipped. We mostly ship through USPS, which is a government run organization, so we tell customers that it may take up to 7 business days just to be safe. International shipments can take anywhere between 2-6 weeks to arrive. International shipping times can be very difficult to predict because of customs and shipping distance. The longest shipment we\u2019ve seen has been 8 weeks to Australia, however we have seen shipments to Australia take as little as a week to arrive.\n5. Also, you claim that all shipping is insured. How does the insurance work if a shipment is damaged or fails to arrive for whatever reason? Do you refund the customer first and then wait for the insurance yourselves, ask the insurer to pay back the customer, or something else?\nFor orders under $50, we actually self insure. A transaction is a binding contract, so we honor all orders either by delivering the goods, or refunding the customer, no matter what. If a shipment that is insured (over $50) is lost in transit we must file a claim with our insurance company. The insurance company usually requires us, and our customer, to fill out an affidavit. The affidavit we sign is basically a sworn statement saying that the goods were sent and packaged properly. The customers affidavit is a sworn statement that they did not receive the goods. We do not refund the customer until after they help us fill out this paperwork, so that we can complete the insurance claim. After filling out the affidavit we send either a refund or a reshipment, which is determined on a case by case basis, such as if we still have the item in stock.\n6. You mention that you\u2019re now getting nearly $200k per month in revenue through Bitcoin. Exactly how much is that compared to the rest of your business? \nIn the last few days we have actually been doing between $20,000-40,000 per day in just bitcoin sales. Bitcoin sales are only a part of our business, however it is beginning to become a substantial part. So much so that we have to hire additional employees to help handle the bitcoin orders. I find this astounding because the bitcoin community is creating jobs. We can directly attribute the hiring of our next few employees to the growth of our bitcoin sales. A politician could not say the same thing about job creation.\n7. Do you have any plans to more specifically expand towards or target Bitcoin users in the future?\nYes, we have just added a bitcoin currency selector to our website so that customers can see prices of our products in bitcoins. We also have a gold/silver price ticker that updates every 60 seconds and can now be viewed in bitcoins. We are working on a landing page to help users understand bitcoins, where to buy them, and the benefits of alternative competing currencies and sound money. Many other bitcoin accepting companies already have these pages, so hopefully the more companies that make it easier for people to understand bitcoins, the more people can easily start using them. We are also spending bitcoins back into the community through advertising, graphics design, web development, and recently working with an insurance company who accepts bitcoins to see if we can work together.\n8. Anything else you would like to tell us?\nI am so thrilled be in the midst of this revolutionary phenomenon. It has changed the way we think about money and alternative competing currencies. Bitcoins have generated real wealth, jobs, and the spread of individual liberty around the world. At first I just acknowledged this phenomenon as something pretty cool, but to be a part of it and to see the spontaneous order of the bitcoin community in motion is something spectacular to witness.", "year": 2013, "month": 4, "day": 11}

The announcement has nothing to do with recent technical problems that all exchanges have been facing for the past week to due the sudden massive increase in trade volume; rather, the root cause behind the shutdown is the closure of BitFloor\u2019s US bank account. Founder Roman Shtylman writes:\nI am sorry to announce that due to circumstances outside of our control BitFloor must cease all trading operations indefinitely. Unfortunately, our US bank account is scheduled to be closed and we can no longer provide the same level of USD deposits and withdrawals as we have in the past. As such, I have made the decision to halt operations and return all funds. Over the next days we will be working with all clients to ensure that everyone receives their funds. Please be patient as we process your request.\u2013 Romanfounder \u2013 bitfloor.com\nTrading has been suspended, and BitFloor founder Roman Shtylman assures users that they will get all of their current deposits back over the next few days, including USD holdings which will be refunded directly to depositors\u2019 bank accounts by ACH transfer. International users are asked to await further instructions.\nThe exchange was a very popular way of buying bitcoins in the United States, so BitFloor customers will now have to look for alternatives. Some BitFloor users will undoubtedly be picked up by the dominant exchange MtGox through its North American partner Coinlab, although other options include Coinbase, CampBX and BTC-e.\nParticularly affected by the shutdown are those users who had lost their deposits when the exchange was hacked in September. BitFloor lost $250,000 from the hack, normally a fatal loss for an exchange of its size, but BitFloor soon came back online with the promise that it would eventually pay back its depositors over time. The exchange even started fulfilling its promise, paying back 1.7% of the money owed in November and another 1% in March, but the remainder of the debt remains unpaid, and although most people had already written off the loss in September, there is now no longer any hope at all that the money will ever be recovered.\nThe announcement is also an unfortunate one because it represents a step backwards in the progress of the exchange industry as a whole. BitFloor is far from the first Bitcoin exchange to fall victim to this kind of shutdown; many Bitcoin exchanges around the world, including several times even MtGox, have had their bank accounts shut down, although in MtGox\u2019s case the exchange\u2019s main bank account in Japan has remained unscathed. The number of shutdowns has waned in recent months, but the risk has remained as risk for every exchange in the industry since exchanges first began to appear en masse in 2011. Now, when the need for more exchanges is clearer than ever, a reinforced precedent of banks shutting down smaller exchanges may instead push more users to larger and generally more resilient exchanges like MtGox out of fear for the safety of their funds. Fortunately, today exchanges do place much more emphasis on maintaining a healthy relationship with their banks and ensuring legality, and new alternatives are constantly appearing. Tradehill intends to launch a new, high-quality Bitcoin exchange soon, the cash-based Bitcoin ATM continues to be under development as a completely fresh alternative, and we can be sure that there are other projects now under development. Although Bitfloor will certainly be missed, hopefully it will soon find an even better replacement.", "year": 2013, "month": 4, "day": 19}
{"title": "The Bitcoin Crash: An Examination", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/the-bitcoin-crash-an-examination-1365911041/", "birthday": "Apr 13, 2013  11:44 PM EST", "date": "2013-04-14 04:44:00", "content": "April 10 was perhaps the most eventful day on the Bitcoin markets in nearly two years. The price started the day at roughly $200, briefly spiked up to an all-time high of $266, and then precipitously crashed, dropping down to nearly $100 in a matter of hours, and perhaps signalling the end of the four-month-long rally since the currency first started to rise from its plateau of $13 in January this year. Trade volume on all major exchanges, even if denominated in bitcoins, hit an all-time high, including a total of over $45 million USD (550,000 BTC) traded on MtGox on April 12 alone, and over $30 million on April 12 \u2013 altogether earning the exchange significantly over $100,000 in revenue over the three days. Public attention on Bitcoin hit an all-time high, with the Bitcoin subreddit briefly becoming the 14th most viewed Reddit community, even surpassing front-page categories such as \u201cmovies\u201d and \u201ctechnology\u201c. For the next two days, the carnage continued, and the price fell to a low of $54.20 before partially recovering roughly to the April 1 level of $100, as the Bitcoin community is left wondering what is going to happen next.\nThe major events of the crash are as follows. At 12:00 GMT on Wednesday, March 10, the Bitcoin price struck its new high of $266, and the direction the price was going slowly began to turn down. After collapsing to $240 the price briefly rebounded to $258, but then quickly resumed its downward path, breaking below $225 in four hours, $200 in five hours and striking a low of $105 at 19:20 GMT, before once again temporarily rebounding to a maximum of $203 for several minutes. During the downswing, the trading ending lag on MtGox \u2013 that is, the amount of time between a user making an order on the exchange and the order being processed, itself reached a new record high: over seventy minutes.\nSeeking an explanation for the crash, many quickly came up with one possible answer: DDoS attacks. A distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, attack, consists of an individual or organization with a large computer network attempting to deliberately overwhelm a target with requests so that the server is too busy to handle legitimate users. Such attacks had happened to MtGox before in the past few months, the likely intent having been to trigger a price crash which the perpetrators can profit from by shorting or buying at the bottom, and so naturally many were wondering if the same had happened on April 10. But MtGox\u2019s Twitter account, which would become the main outlet for public relations messages from the exchange throughout the entire period, soon confirmed that this was not the case; \u201cit is not DDOSed, it is lag due to high volume trades,\u201d the tweet explained. A few hours later, trading somewhat subsided, and latency decreased, but soon enough another problem appeared: some users were having problems reaching MtGox\u2019s website at all. Fortunately, the issue was not too serious; \u201cNetwork maintenance, don\u2019t freak out!\u201d, a second tweet explained.\nSoon enough, however, the DDoSers did finally join the scene. Access to the site continued to be sluggish, and less than than twenty minutes after the tweet about the maintennance, MtGox released yet another tweet: \u201cMaintenance Over, however we are now under a DDoS attack.\u201d Also, users investigating MtGox\u2019s public order logs soon discovered that another kind of DDoS was taking place at the same time: MtGox\u2019s database was being flooded with thousands of small orders of very low value, which many believe could have no possible purpose other than to slow MtGox down.\nA few hours after that, MtGox responded to the situation with a drastic move that had not been done for nearly two years: for two hours, the exchange shut down trades entirely, claiming that its staff needed the time to upgrade its servers to handle the increased load. After the two hour maintennance, however, the exchange had further technical issues, and remained essentially inaccessible for eight hours further. The Bitcoin economy was already in a state of shock, and loss of the largest exchange in the Bitcoin economy, on which roughly 60% of all trades normally take place, put the markets into a state of panic. Other exchanges, many of which were also intermittently down due to the combination of DDOS and trading activity, disagreed on exactly what the price was supposed to be, but a general consensus soon formed: it was going further down. BitStamp dropped down to about $60, and when MtGox finally re-opened it quickly dropped from its pre-shutdown level of $120 to $75, briefly rose back to $130, and then once agan plunged, ultimately hitting about $60 as well. On April 12, MtGox struck a low of $54.25, but the panic finally subsided, and the price has since rebounded to over $100.\nWhat is most interesting about the price crash, however, is not the change to the price itself \u2013 rather, it\u2019s what we learned from it. Ultimately, the crash has served as a sudden, massive stress test to all sides of the Bitcoin ecosystem: the infrastructure\u2019s ability to hold together, the market\u2019s ability to withstand and recover from the sudden drop in price, and the Bitcoin community\u2019s ability to retain its confidence. And the test proved to be very revealing. We now know exactly what are the strengths of the Bitcoin economy, where the performance is acceptable and where we seriously need to improve.\nThe main weakness of the Bitcoin economy is now obvious: the exchanges, and specifically the singular dominant position of MtGox. After MtGox was first created in 2010, it quickly became by far the largest exchange in the Bitcoin economy, at its peak in June 2011 reaching a market share of over 97%. Since then, the relative size of MtGox has decreased somewhat as other exchanges have slowly gained the community\u2019s trust, but the market remains an oligopoly, with MtGox still retaining a market share of about 65%. The sheer volume of bitcoins traded on the exchange, combined with the prime importance of exchanges to the Bitcoin economy, gives MtGox the power to, whether through malice, incompetence or simple human error, significantly manipulate the Bitcoin price in either direction unilaterally.\nOn April 10, it was MtGox\u2019s poor preparation that proved to be the deciding factor. The trading lag problem that MtGox faced on the first day of the crash was not new; in fact, it had been present during nearly every minor flash crash on the way up to $260 since the price first broke through its 2011 all-time high of $32, with trading engine lag frequently reaching twenty to forty minutes at its peaks. Despite this advance warning, and despite the massive amount of resources that the company had at its disposal following three months of rapidly increasing profits from trade commissions, the exchange did nothing to improve its systems \u2013 until it was already too late.\nOther exchanges tended to perform better than MtGox throughout the three days of the crash, but they too were not unscathed. BitStamp shut down entirely for about one hour on April 11, but remained relatively responsive for the rest of the duration. Bitfloor had three brief shutdowns lasting one to two hours each, and BTC-E saw about three hours of downtime on April 11.\nThus, the technical issues alone are relatively excusable; other Bitcoin exchanges, including BitFloor, BitStamp and Coinbase, are also struggling to adapt to the Bitcoin community\u2019s rapid growth, although some are managing better than others. MtGox\u2019s main failure, rather, is how it dealt with them. Soon after its tweet confirming that there was no DDoS, the exchange released a longer message (Pastebin) explaining what had happened in more detail. The message started with the following, now infamous, phrase: \u201cwe would like to reassure you [that] no we were not last night victim of a DDoS but instead victim of our own success!\u201d It then followed:\nIndeed the rather astonishing amount of new account opened in the last few days added to the existing one plus the number of trade made a huge impact on the overall system that started to lag. As expected in such situation people started to panic, started to sell Bitcoin in mass (Panic Sale) resulting in an increase of trade that ultimately froze the trade engine!\u201cTo give you an idea of how impressive things were here are some numbers that we would love to share with you guys:The number of trades executed triple in the last 24hrs.The number of new account opened went from 60k for March alone to 75k new account created for the first few days of April! We now have roughly 20,000 new accounts created each day.\nIn th eyes of many Bitcoin users, perhaps grieving at the sudden disappearance at their hope of instant riches, but also legitimately angry at the exchange\u2019s failure to perform up to the Bitcoin community\u2019s expectations, the message amounted to little more than rubbing salt on their wounds, gloating that while the rest of the Bitcoin economy, and even MtGox\u2019s actual service, was in disarray the exchange\u2019s usage volumes and profits were higher than ever.\nThe second major error that MtGox made was shutting down the exchange. Upgrading one\u2019s systems is a laudable goal, and even if it took a twelve-hour downtime it had to have been done eventually, but MtGox missed completely on timing. At a time when the Bitcoin market was in the middle of its greatest phase of instability in nearly two years, and what Bitcoin users wanted most of all was simply confidence that the infrastructure still worked, almost without warning the exchange responsible for nearly two thirds of all of the world\u2019s Bitcoin trade simply shut down. To be fair, there was some warning; at the end of their message denying a DDoS attack MtGox wrote that they would have to \u201cclose the exchange for two hours in the next 12 to 24hrs to add several new servers to [their] system,\u201d but few received the message, and moreover there is a large difference between the two hours that were promised and the ten for which the exchange was down in reality.\nSince then MtGox has made an honest effort at damage control, and took two major steps to regain the public trust. The first, unfortuantely, proved to be counterproductive. Seeking to make up for their poor performance in the eyes of the Bitcoin community, MtGox temporarily lifted all trading fees on the exchange. At first glance, this appears to be an act of niceness, but an understanding of basic economics would have quickly revealed the folly of the scheme: once fees were taken off, trade volume spiked up massively, and trading lag once again hit over 45 minutes on April 13, requiring MtGox to shut down once again for five minutes.\nThe other measure that MtGox took, however, was quite laudable, and undoubtedly had a positive effect on maintaining confidence. MtGox CEO Mark Karpeles opened thread on Reddit saying \u201cWe are MtGox. Ask [us] anything.\u201d Some quotes from MtGox\u2019s answers include:\nWe absolutely understand this. The fact is that we are programmers and engineers, not PR guys, and we are still building out our capabilities beyond technology and into servicing our customers better. So, yes, we\u2019re moving on this now and have secured help \u2026 Please keep in mind that we are not native English speakers, and that was a poor choice of words. The \u201csuccess\u201d is in the quick uptake of bitcoin most of all.NO. Everything is accounted for (BTC and money). Fractional reserve is absolutely against our principles. In fact 90~95% of BTC are held in cold storage.No. We have a company policy that forbids employees (contractually) from trading on the exchangeOur system was designed to handle 2~3x our normal load, but now we\u2019re experiencing 10x the amount, which was difficult to prepare for (it takes weeks) with the sudden new accounts. We have two problems: the DDos and volume related to new accounts. The trade engine is capable of accepting much more of a load. Within 2~3 weeks we will completely rewrite the trade engine, in the meantime we shut down the system today and installed a new server with the current trade engine. Of course, if we didn\u2019t have DDos everything would be fine, so now we\u2019re dealing with two issues at once.\nMtGox now much more frequently releases updates on Twitter, and posts longer messages on issues like outages and denial of service attacks when needed. As a result, the exchange has arguably shifted from being one of the most closed companies in the Bitcoin community to one of the more open.\nNevertheless, what the events of the past three days have shown is two things. First, the current state of Bitcoin exchanges as a whole is woefully inadequate to handle the kind of load that would come with being a mainstream part of the global financial system. The root of the problem is not the lack of a sufficient number of servers; rather, it\u2019s architecture. Aside from the brief maintennance and DDOS on April 11, MtGox\u2019s network-facing servers generally performed well, and it was clear that processing orders was the bottleneck. From the information that is publicly available, many have concluded that MtGox\u2019s database architecture can currently only handle orders in series (ie. one at a time) \u2013 a setup that works decently for small numbers of transactions, but breaks down completely at a large scale.\n\u201cA modern stock exchange today really isn\u2019t an application, it a group of systems that pass messages. Stock trading systems are designed that way so that when you place an order it wil be executed in a predictable and constant amount of time,\u201d security expect Andreas Antonoupolos explains on The Daily Bitcoin Show. The exchanges we have today, on the other hand are largely designed more like traditional web applications, an industry in which order of operations is not particularly important because the activity of most accounts is independent. This is understandable; most Bitcoin exchanges were originally designed by web developers, who may be experienced in their own fields but had no experience implementing financial systems before they came to Bitcoin. However, it nevertheless means that the performance of nearly all exchanges is currently highly suboptimal.\nFortunately, Bitcoin is now seeing more and more attention from mainstream financial institutions, and it is quite likely that from this attention much more high-quality exchanges will emerge. There are already specially designed high-volume exchanges appearing specifically to serve the needs of high-volume institutional investors; Tradehill\u2019s Prime and the Malta-based Exante\u2019s Bitcoin hedge fund may well be only the first two of many more to come, and now that the recent FINCEN ruling has established guidelines describing the legal status of Bitcoin exchanges it would not be surprising if a mainstream financial firm was already working on a professionally designed Bitcoin exchange for ordinary users as well.\nSecond, the Bitcoin economy is now simply too large for one exchange to handle, no matter how efficient and scalable its architecture may be. Both this crash and many previous crashes, large and small, were ultimately caused by some kind of lag or glitch on MtGox, and the fact that the actions of a single company are essentially the deciding factor for whether each individual flash crash turns out to be minor or catastrophic bodes ill for the future stability of the Bitcoin markets. There are alternatives; BitStamp has expanded greatly in the past few months, as have Bitfloor and BTC-e, and very soon they will have the opportunity to expand much further. The reason is this: one of MtGox\u2019s main advantages over exchanges like BitStamp to date has been the fact that it allows users to place orders even if they do not have enough money in the right currency to fill them \u2013 a very useful feature, as it allows a trader to, for example, put a buy threshold at $110 and a sell at $140 and set himself to profit from a movement in either direction if he believes that the price will ultimately stabilize in between. Starting April 17, however, this feature will be gone, making MtGox no longer any better than BitStamp or anyone else.\nThere are also several other options are on the horizon. One developer in San Francisco has started ButterCoin, an open source project to create an exchange platform that can handle a high level of load. Another \u201cexchange\u201d worth watching is Ripple, a new decentralized digital payment network that intends to allow users to store and handle any currency, including fiat currencies, bitcoins and potentially even precious metals, using Bitcoin-like wallets, addresses and transactions. Ripple includes a built-in \u201cdecentralized exchange\u201d functionality that allows users to trade one currency in the Ripple network for another directly \u2013 that is, without involving any third parties to complete the transaction. The system is not perfect; just like Bitcoin, ultimately every server must verify every transaction, but unlike MtGox the architecture was designed to be highly parallelizable from the start, allowing servers to scale to any number of transactions simply by adding more cores.\nBut there is also an aspect of Bitcoin that has held its own extremely well the last three days: its reputation. Even after Bitcoin crashed, articles on The Economist, Time and TechCrunch rushed out to look \u201cbeyond the bubble\u201d and defend it, the Winklevoss twins, known for their very early involvement in Faceboook, caught the media\u2019s eye for their support of Bitcoin, and the Business Insider ran a piece by Dan Kaminsky positively discussing one of Bitcoin\u2019s greatest strengths: its security. \u201cIt is a fairly open secret that almost all systems can be hacked, somehow,\u201d Kaminsky wrote, \u201c\u2026 by all extant metrics in security system review, this system should have failed instantaneously, at every possible layer. And, to be fair, it has failed at other layers \u2013 BitCoin thefts have occurred, in the meta-code that surrounds the core technology itself. But the core technology actually works, and has continued to work, to a degree not everyone predicted.\u201d After the crash, CNBC added a Bitcoin price ticker to their webpage \u2013 an indicator that at least that organization believes that Bitcoin is something worth watching for many months to come. In June 2011, the response was the opposite; media attention quickly turned grim, and over the next five months mainstream websites wrote a number or articles describing Bitcoin\u2019s ignominous fall. This time, the extent to which the usually fickle mainstream media is willing to continue believing in Bitcoin should shock everyone. To an extent that many still do not realize, this is a hugely positive sign for Bitcoin going forward.\nFrom here, it is hard to tell what will happen. The last two major crashes, one in June 2011 and the other in August 2012 had very different aftermaths; after the crash from $32 to about $15 June, the price continued dropping, almost hitting pre-bubble levels with its November low of $1.994. After August, the price recovered quickly, bouncing between $10 and $13 for four months before finally starting its present rise. This time, anything could happen. We could always see further drops, with one capitulation following another and the price perhaps even dropping below $30, we could stabilize at $100 to $180 or we could see $500 within two months; at this point it is simply too hard to tell. Even if Bitcoin\u2019s meteoric rise does not continue, however, all in all in two years\u2019 time we will have gained greatly from the ordeal. Out of the bubble of 2011 came companies such as BitPay, WalletBit (now BIPS), BitStamp and BitInstant, all of which are now mainstays of the Bitcoin economy. We have already seen a number of businesses come out of 2013; the BitcoinStore, Prime and Ripple are three great examples, and there are many other projects brewing behind the scenes, and if Bitcoin continues to grow it will be these that set the stage for the bubble of 2015 \u2013 or the bubble of May 2013. Until it comes, we\u2019ll never know.", "year": 2013, "month": 4, "day": 14}

The initiative quickly proved to be very successful, raising over 10 BTC ($1,300) in little more than a single day, and other major torrent sites have quickly started to do the same thing. EZTV, OpenBitTorrent, PublicBitTorrent and istole.it have all added Bitcoin donation addresses onto their front pages.\nIn terms of promoting awareness, this is a fairly large step forward for Bitcoin. The Pirate Bay is ranked by Alexa as the 77th most visited site on the internet, placing it above all other Bitcoin-accepting sites to date except WordPress at 21st. However, the Pirate Bay\u2019s use of Bitcoin, and that of the other torrent sites that have rapidly followed suit, is much more prominent. Unlike WordPress, Namecheap and Reddit, which do not make any attempt to advertise their acceptance of Bitcoin beyond an initial press release, the Bitcoin address on The Pirate Bay in particular is immediately visible to everyone who accesses the page. The message that The Pirate Bay is sending is clear: you do not need to be ashamed about supporting Bitcoin. Sure, Bitcoin is controversial, with some mainstream economists coming out outright against it, but what revolution isn\u2019t? As an organization whose very continued existence has come to symbolize an ongoing victory against the pro-copyright establishment, The Pirate Bay understands this better than almost anyone else \u2013 except perhaps Wikileaks, although incidentally Wikileaks accepts Bitcoin too, and are actually doing quite well with it.\nOf course, businesses like WordPress, Reddit and NameCheap are not charities, and essentially since have already made the bold step of accepting Bitcoin in the first place we should not demand them to more actively promote Bitcoin from the kindness of their hearts if they do not want to. Fortunately, however, at least in spirit The Pirate Bay is a charity, and as members of the Bitcoin community, we should be very grateful that such organizations exist. It is only through people and organizations continually and passively promoting Bitcoin in this way that the currency will reach any kind of significant cultural acceptance \u2013 simple news articles primarily lead to transitory interest that, in the case of the latest bubble, has already largely faded away. News promotes Bitcoin as something special; passive promotion promotes Bitcoin as something normal. The answer to which one evokes less hostile attention from regulators, more interest from casual users, and ultimately more willingness on the part of more traditional businesses to accept Bitcoin and show it, is clear.\nWhen donating bitcoins in general, there is one security reminder that is important to repeat: don\u2019t copy a donation address from anything other than the official website, and do not post a donation address without directly linking to the page that confirms the address as being legitimate. Posting fraudulent donation addresses is very easy, and it would be a shame if the Bitcoin community\u2019s charitable nature were to be exploited by the most trivial of scams.

{"title": "Butterfly Labs Ships First Finished ASIC For Review", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/butterfly-labs-ships-first-finished-asic-for-review-1366653384/", "birthday": "Apr 22, 2013  1:56 PM EST", "date": "2013-04-22 18:56:00", "content": "After nearly six months of delays, Butterfly Labs has finally released a copy of what appears to be the final version of one of their long-awaited ASIC mining products. Similarly to how Avalon first shipped a sample copy of their mining rig to Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik, Butterfly Labs shipped their first unit to David Perry of Coding in My Sleep. David received the unit Saturday evening, and uploaded a video of himself unboxing and testing it the same day.\nThe unit in question is a Bitforce SC Jalapeno, the smallest of the four models that the company is selling, and it appears to be running flawlessly, connecting to mining pools with minimal setup and consistently cranking out 4.5-5.7 GH/s, within fifteen percent of its operating specifications. However, aside from the hash rate the statistics do not nearly live up to what the company had originally promised. The device is roughly 10x10x8 cm in size, about three times higher than the relatively flat design that had originally been conceived for the Jalapeno \u2013 the name itself coming from the idea that the machine could be used as a coffee warmer. In fact, the company has now quietly dropped the Jalapeno name from this low-end version of its product, preferring instead to use the more mundane \u201c5 GH/s Bitcoin Miner\u201d. However, the device is still somewhat better than those of its chief competitor: Avalon\u2019s miner offers 65 GH/s for 620 W , or about 10.5 W per GH/s compared to Butterfly Labs\u2019 six, and fits into the space of a desktop computer \u2013 a space into which Butterfly Labs can put 120 GH/s worth of its Jalapenos.\nThe device\u2019s power consumption is 30 watts, giving an efficiency of 6 joules per gigahash (or 6 watts per GH/s; the two units are the same), six times higher than what the company originally promised. However, for those who have been following mining news, this is not surprising. When Avalon first released their miners in January, founder Yifu Guo had said in an interview: \u201cThey won\u2019t reach the power consumption they were claiming. Recently they changed it to 1.2w, but they won\u2019t even reach that.\u201d Avalon\u2019s own simulations at the time showed that even with Butterfly Labs\u2019 superior 65-nanometer precision manufacturing process it would only be possible to reach about 3W per GH/s. At the time, many (including myself) criticized Avalon for their inferior figures with regard to both power efficiency and size, but now the truth has become clear: Avalon was simply being realistic.\nIn February and March, Butterfly Labs staff informed customers on their forums that they were having problems keeping to their power consumption targets, and at the beginning of April Bitcoin developer Luke Dashjr publicly confirmed that Butterfly Labs had a working ASIC, but the machine was consuming 180 W to produce only 25 GH/s. The device was not quite production-quality, and some argued that perhaps it was working so inefficiently because it was defective, but at that point it became clear to everyone that 1.2W would remain a pipe dream for many months to come. With its current efficiency of 6 W per GH/s, the \u201cJalapeno\u201d remains more efficient, but far from what had been originally promised.\nThirty watts is still not a very high power expenditure; the extra 25 watts gives an expenditure of 0.6 kWh, or about $0.10 per day \u2013 a pittance compared to the $29.52 per day (that\u2019s 5 GH/s per miner / 75000 GH/s total network hashrate * 25 BTC per block * 144 blocks per day * $123 per bitcoin) of profit that the device can currently produce. But it is nevertheless a serious inconvenience for two reasons. First of all, contrary to Butterfly Labs\u2019 original intent, the device won\u2019t be running off a USB anytime soon. Second, and more importantly, assuming that larger units will have a similar power to output ratio, people in apartments will have difficulty powering large numbers of Single SCs or a MiniRig (now expected to be 10 kW), meaning that those buyers will need to come up with alternative arrangements to run their machines.\nFortunately, Butterfly Labs has provided just that: in a recent FAQ update, the company wrote: \u201cWhen ordering equipment from Butterfly Labs, you have the option of hosting your equipment locally with one of our affiliate data centers. Your hosted units will be added to a mining farm and you will be paid out regularly based on their collective output.\u201d What is interesting is that Butterfly Labs and its competitor ASICMiner, taking two completely different paths, have now seen their business models converge to one and the same: Butterfly Labs, initially only selling machines, is now offering what from the buyer\u2019s view is essentially an investment product \u2013 although they are careful to maintain that they are still actually selling hardware, giving the buyer the responsibility of configuring their device on the software side, and ASICMiner, originally literally selling shares, is now also selling machines. For those concerned about Bitcoin network centralization, Butterfly Labs\u2019 announcement is unfortunate, as a significant fraction of the Bitcoin network will end up headquartered in one place, although the hosting location will not be administrated by Butterfly Labs themselves, and ASICMiner\u2019s opposite announcement effectively counteracts the added centralization from this program.\nSo far, only the Jalapeno has been publicly released to anyone, so it still remains to be seen exactly what Butterfly Labs will do with their larger units.

{"title": "OzCoin Hacked, Stolen Funds Seized and Returned by StrongCoin", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/ozcoin-hacked-stolen-funds-seized-and-returned-by-strongcoin-1366822516/", "birthday": "Apr 24, 2013  12:55 PM EST", "date": "2013-04-24 17:55:00", "content": "OzCoin, one of the larger Bitcoin mining pools, has reported that an unknown attacker managed to hack into their server, defacing their website and database and stealing 923 BTC ($135,000) from their Bitcoin wallet. However, in less than a day over half of the money was seized as it was passing through the web wallet StrongCoin, and promptly returned to Ozcoin. 354.06 BTC are still missing, and will likely never be found, but this nevertheless leaves OzCoin with a much softer blow than what anyone expected.\nAlthough most people agree with StrongCoin\u2019s actions, this is nevertheless a very worrying sign for the security and privacy of StrongCoin, and other web wallets by extension. StrongCoin is what is often called a hybrid web wallet, accessible as a website on the internet but doing all of the transaction signing and address management in Javascript on the client side. Essentially, the client is downloading a fresh version of the wallet software from StrongCoin each time, and from that point, in theory, the software becomes just as secure as any other client-side program. The user\u2019s wallet data, including the private keys needed to sign transactions, is backed up on StrongCoin\u2019s servers, but it is encrypted and decrypted client-side using the user\u2019s password so, once again in theory, there should be no way for StrongCoin themselves to get hold of the user\u2019s private keys. StrongCoin heavily advertises this feature; on the website\u2019s front page, they write: \u201cTherefore our servers only hold encrypted private keys and neither we nor anyone else can spend your Bitcoins. Only you.\u201d Except they just did.\nInspections of StrongCoin\u2019s client-side code have confirmed that StrongCoin is in fact operating exactly as a client-side web wallet should. This leaves only one possibility: StrongCoin essentially hacked their own service. By injecting code that would automatically send all of a user\u2019s funds to themselves as soon as the user entered their password, a web wallet provider can easily steal from any of their users provided that they log in with enough frequency. Attacks like these are the reason why security analysts have generally come out against Javascript cryptography; this and other arguments are well-explained in Matasano\u2019s article \u201cJavascript Cryptography Considered Harmful\u201c. This time, StrongCoin used this vulnerability to do good, but at the same time they have critically undermined the trustworthiness of their service; people use hybrid web wallets over centralized services like Coinbase precisely because they do not trust central service providers to always do the right thing.\nIt should be noted that the other major hybrid web wallet provider, Blockchain.info, has taken steps to protect their users against such an attack. Their web wallet is also offered in the form of a Chrome and Firefox extension, which is essentially equivalent to any other piece of desktop software with the sole difference being that it relies on the user\u2019s browser to interpret its source code. Safari users also have a Wallet Verifier plugin, although its scope is much weaker.\nThe other issue is privacy. Explaining how they discovered that the thief was using their service, StrongCoin wrote that \u201cEverytime you make a payment from StrongCoin the fee goes to 1STRonGxnFTeJiA7pgyneKknR29AwBM77 so any payments from strongcoin held accounts are easily traced back to the site.\u201d Presumably, bitcoins from the theft were traced through the blockchain until one of the transactions made its way to StrongCoin, at that point establishing a direct link between the StrongCoin account and the thief. This actually marks the first time that a significant amount of money was successfully recovered using the help of blockchain analysis. Although blockchain analyses made by various researchers have been able to draw intricate graphs mapping Bitcoin transactions to a few high-profile users, until now the public transaction log in the Bitcoin blockchain had not managed to track down or stop a single large-scale theft \u2013 casting doubt on claims that Bitcoin is not anonymous. This incident does not imply that Bitcoin now has no privacy at all; StrongCoin\u2019s counter-hack was only possible because the transaction came very soon after the original theft and the thief had not yet made any strong attempt at obfuscation, and StrongCoin\u2019s wallet in particular is weak in terms of privacy because add transaction fees are sent to one particular address (1STRonGxnFTeJiA7pgyneKknR29AwBM77). However, it is still a worthy incident to point to when confronted with concerns that Bitcoin facilitates untraceable theft.\nThose using StrongCoin should decide for themselves whether staying with StrongCoin is worth it. Those who enjoy StrongCoin for the user interface features should probably stay; StrongCoin has been in the Bitcoin community for a long time, and if users are willing to outright entrust their funds to exchanges it is not a leap to trust StrongCoin to do the right thing as well. Those who like the cryptographic client-side security aspect, on the other hand, should consider switching to Blockchain.info \u2013 or, better yet, a client-side wallet like Electrum. As for StrongCoin themselves, if they wish to maintain their status as a secure hybrid web wallet, they should quickly get to work on catching up with Blockchain.info and implement a Firefox and Chrome extension.", "year": 2013, "month": 4, "day": 24}
{"title": "Bitcoin Is Not Antisocial: A Rebuttal to Paul Krugman", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-is-not-antisocial-a-rebuttal-to-paul-krugman-1366054419/", "birthday": "Apr 15, 2013  3:33 PM EST", "date": "2013-04-15 20:33:00", "content": "In the New York Times, columnist Paul Krugman has written a lengthy article criticizing Bitcoin from an economic point of view, entitled \u201cThe Antisocial Network\u201d. This is the third article on Bitcoin that Krugman has written so far, following \u201cGolden Cyberfetters\u201d from September 2011 and \u201cAdam Smith Hates Bitcoin\u201d from April 12. Although he is far from the only economist to have a dim view of the currency, unlike the others his writings on the New York times are read by a large number of people, and the article is also a representative sample of what many who share his political ideology are likely to believe, and so it deserves some specific attention.\nThe first thing that immediately comes out when reading the article is: Krugman has not bothered to do his research. After the introductory paragraphs, he asks the questions \u201cWhat is bitcoin?\u201d, and starts to answer \u201cIt\u2019s sometimes described as a way to make transactions online \u2014 but that in itself would be nothing new in a world of online credit-card and PayPal transactions,\u201d and then follows up \u201cSo how is bitcoin different? Unlike credit card transactions, which leave a digital trail, bitcoin transactions are designed to be anonymous and untraceable.\u201d And then \u2013 that\u2019s it. Krugman expands on the point a few sentences further, repeating the old canard that Bitcoin is \u201cprimarily\u201d used for \u201cnarcotics and other illegal items\u201d, but then he utterly fails to cite any of Bitcoin\u2019s other advantages. Namely: no chargebacks, reducing costs for some merchants by as much as ten percent, much lower fees \u2013 low enough, in fact, that with BitPay\u2019s recent fee cut to 0.99% the roundtrip of buying bitcoins with USD in the United States, giving them to a merchant, and having the merchant convert them back to USD has lower fees than a single credit card swipe (that\u2019s 1.99% vs 2.9% + $0.30). Bitcoin is also international, making is just as easy to send money from Kyrgyzstan to Guatemala as it is to your neighbor. This is the reason why many believe that the next great Bitcoin bull markets will originate in China and Africa.\nAs for drugs, Krugman\u2019s claim that \u201cthe main use of bitcoin so far, other than as a target for speculation, has been for online versions of those dark-alley exchanges\u201d is outright false. Silk Road has actually considerably decreased in relative importance. Privacy has far more uses than just drugs; Target\u2019s algorithms discovering that a girl was pregnant before her own father is one often-cited example. Also, although Bitcoin advocates often try to steer clear of making the point, even if Silk Road was much larger than it is, the majority of Americans now support legalizing marijuana \u2013 making Krugman\u2019s mention of the Silk Road serve more as an ad than an actual criticism.\nKrugman, however, does not talk about any of the above. Rather, as he frequently does, he examines the Bitcoin through a single lens: that of his particular views on monetary policy. Both in \u201cGolden Cyberfetters\u201d and \u201cThe Antisocial Network\u201d, Krugman seems fixated on the fact that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in circulation, and the only partical criticisms of Bitcoin that Krugman has made rest on either this or the concept of mining. \u201cThe whole concept of having to \u201cmine\u201d Bitcoins by expending real resources amounts to a drastic retrogression,\u201d Krugman writes in the previous piece. Of course, this is a reasonable argument \u2013 if a decentralized currency would emerge that has all of Bitcoin\u2019s properties but does not waste energy on electricity, it would be a significant improvement over Bitcoin as it stands today. Ripple\u2018s consensus is one way that might potentially be done. However, when looking at the energy properties of Bitcoin it is important to realize the very thing that Krugman has failed to: that Bitcoin is much more than just a currency. The fiat currency analogue of Bitcoin miners \u2013 that is, the systems that Bitcoin mining has a chance to replace is not just the mint and the Federal Reserve; rather, it\u2019s the mint, the Federal Reserve, Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, Western Union and half of the banking system.\nThe reason that one can make such a lofty claim is that, unlike fiat currencies, which have only become digital through proprietary addons created by intermediaries such as those listed above, Bitcoin is digital from the start. In the case of fiat currency, you do not need any intermediaries to transmit money offline \u2013 you can just hand the counterparty the bill \u2013 but you certainly do need them to transmit it online. And in an age when interest rates in the traditional banking system are essentially zero, the reason why most people deal with banks at all is that they have to in order to do anything financial in an increasingly digital age. With Bitcoin, on the other hand, that need disappears. Sending money is as easy as sending an email, and so any intermediaries that do exist either have to do with interfacing with the traditional banking system, or adding genuine value. Of course, I say half of the banking system because banks do, at least in theory serve an important function in the economy, and regardless of who is doing is that function will have to be done somehow. Thus, banks will certainly not disappear entirely in a world where Bitcoin emerges into the mainstream. However, they will actually have to provide depositors with an incentive for storing their money with them, and part of that will necessarily be convincing depositors that they are legitimately engaged in making loans to value-generating businesses rather than martingale-style gambling \u2013 and their size and scope will almost certainly considerably reduce as a result.\nAs for the monetary critique, I personally agree that having an entire world running on nothing but Bitcoin as a medium of exchange and store of value would be a disaster. But that is extremely unlikely to happen. Bitcoin is only the first in the cryptocurrency movement, and we will likely see many more to come. Ripple already stands out as a promising candidate. A cryptocurrency based around a built-in mechanism for trading computer power is something that we may well see in ten years\u2019 time. Bitcoin may well simply serve as an intermediary \u201cglue\u201d currency that will make it easier for all of the world\u2019s other currencies \u2013 fiat currencies, other cryptocurrencies, local currencies, not-so-local currencies based around internet communities, gold, and even potentially stocks and bonds, to work together with minimal friction. The Bitcoin network can also serve as the backbone of the decentralized stock exchange, allowing large corporate and perhaps even government bonds to be traded as monetary instruments with a stable value and most of Bitcoin\u2019s advantages.\nNow, for the philosophical. Although it is difficult to notice, in the next section Krugman actually contradicts himself. Near the middle of the article, he writes: \u201cGold\u2019s value comes in part because it has nonmonetary uses, such as filling teeth and making jewelry; paper currencies have value because they\u2019re backed by the power of the state, which defines them as legal tender and accepts them as payment for taxes. Bitcoins, however, derive their value, if any, purely from self-fulfilling prophecy, the belief that other people will accept them as payment.\u201d Near the end, however, he makes the opposite claim: \u201cEven when people relied on gold and silver coins, what made those coins useful wasn\u2019t the precious metals they contained, it was the expectation that other people would accept them as payment.\u201d So which is it, Mr. Krugman, is money something that has always been just a social convention, or is it something that requires the support of physical value or the power of the state to have value?\nThe answer is, yes, money is just a social convention, Bitcoin, the US dollar, and to the extent of over 90% of its current value even gold included. First of all, the US dollar is not \u201cbacked\u201d by the power of the state in the standard sense of the word \u2013 there is no ratio at which the state guarantees that a certain number of dollars satisfies this tax obligation. If the value of dollars on the market went down by a factor of ten, the value of each dollar toward paying one\u2019s taxes would do the same. Even if you let this point slide, however, what Krugman ultimately fails to realize is that power is also \u201cjust a social convention\u201d. To understand why, consider why people follow laws. Certainly, many of the most important laws on the books are simultaneously points of basic morality \u2013 don\u2019t kill, don\u2019t steal, and don\u2019t defraud, and many people follow them for that reason alone. But what about gambling laws, drug laws, the intricate complexities of the tax code, patent laws (why 20 years instead of 21?), and business regulations? The answer is, if you break the law, the government will come at you with guns. But why does each individual police officer with a gun come at people (at least in theory) only when the victims have broken laws? Because if he won\u2019t he\u2019ll get fired, and perhaps even disciplined \u2013 by a legal system backed by other people with guns. There are authorities and chiefs at the top, but why do the rank-and-file follow them instead of other chiefs. The chiefs themselves do not have the military power in their hands to coerce their entire bureaucracy. The answer is, it\u2019s just a social convention. This is the world we live in \u2013 it\u2019s social conventions all the way down.\nSecond, the aspects of Bitcoin on which Krugman is fixated are not about avoiding society \u2013 indeed, the only possible function of money is as an intermediary for economic association. Rather, they are about avoiding centralized control. Those who hold pro-government beliefs often make the point of conflating society with government \u2013 making the argument that if you do not like centralized authority and control then you must be some sort of mountain man opposed to the obviously superior strategy of \u201cdoing things together\u201d. A cursory read of libertarian economists like Mises, however, will quickly show that those who generally oppose government intervention do not do so because they despise cooperation \u2013 in fact, Mises and Rothbard in their writings essentially regard free-market cooperation as the highest good. The different sides may disagree on the extent to which decentralized cooperation and society is possible, but it is along those lines that this particular philosophical point promoted by some Bitcoin advocates is made \u2013 not some hatred of society in general.\nThe truth is, decentralized protocols are everywhere, and have served us well for thousands of years. Language, and spoken language in particular, is one example; although we have seen linguistic prescriptivists and the institutions like the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise try to enforce some usages as more elevated and \u201ccorrect\u201d than others, by and large their efforts have failed; \u201cslang\u201d French has developed into a rich and expressive language in its own right without the Acad\u00e9mie\u2019s approval. In writing, prescriptivists have had more success, although that is because writing is taught through centralized formal education rather than the more natural style of learning by example through which children learn how to speak, but by and large language remains a construct that is literally \u201cby the people, for the people\u201d. The internet is another example; although it is far from fully decentralized, is far more decentralized than any long-distance communication medium we have seen before.\nAnd finally, although the architecture of mainstream social networks like Facebook is centralized, it does not need to be; the only reason why alternatives like Diaspora have not caught on to date is their failure to overcome the barrier of network effects, not anything inherent in their lack of a centralized authority, and the existence of one in the case of Facebook arguably only harms it \u2013 see the concerns about advertising and privacy. Furthermore, although social networks are, for the time being, centralized, the activity that comes out of them is not \u2013 the leaderless Arab spring is one example, and even in their more mundance use the very purpose of a social network is facilitating the ultimate decentralized cooperation protocol of all: friendship.\nBut what is the benefit of decentralization and lack of control in the world of money? Many answers were given above: centralized systems are less responsive, power corrupts, and so on. But there is also another one: stability. This argument may seem ludicrous made in the wake of the largest bubble and crash in nearly two years, but one has to remember that the reason why Bitcoin is currently subject to such fluctuations is its small size, and the fact that so much of its value is dependent on the percentage chance that it will grow much larger than it is today. If Bitcoin becomes mainstream, we can reasonably expect it to be more stable than gold, as the two are somewhat similar in their function as stores of value, but unlike gold there is no uncertainty in Bitcoin\u2019s supply.\nKrugman\u2019s argument against moving away from a fiat currency standard is that the US dollar has remained stable, and inflation continues to appear far away, and so there is clearly nothing wrong with the state of central bank money printing. In fact, Krugman says in other articles, since the introduction of fiat currency depressions have actually been much less frequent. But we have already seen that argument elsewhere: nuclear weapons. The \u201cmutually assured destruction\u201d doctrine stated that nuclear weapons would actually bring us peace, because nobody would dare start a war when the consequences could well be the end of the world. And, judging from historical evidence, it looks like it worked. Although we have seen some close calls, with the Cuban Missile Crisis and an accidental false alarm in 1983 almost leading to the annihilation of billions of lives, altogether American nuclear hegemony held through, saving tens of millions from the evils of conventional warfare. And yet a growing number of people are now looking to abolish nuclear weapons entirely. Why? Read over the last two sentences carefully. The lack of medium-scale wars that nuclear hegemony brought saved tens of millions of lives, but it almost killed three billion. This is the effect of illusory stability through centralization: you replace guaranteed small shocks with a small risk of a big one, and until the big shock comes those who express their fear of it are decried as charlatans \u2013 and when it does come, their dead bodies are memorialized as heroes.\nAn argument can be made that centralized fiat currency, in the form of the US dollar/Euro hegemony, is similar; Greece and Cyprus are roughly parallel to the Cuban Missile Crisis and the 1983 incident, although unlike the Soviet incidents both Greece and Cyprus are still very far from safe. For the past three years, we have been a step away from what appears to be total collapse. Given that risk, and the catastrophic consequences of total collapse becoming reality, the more frequent recessions of the 19th century seem preferable by comparison. \u201cThe very act of suppressing fluctuations renders systems extremely prone to large-scale disruptions,\u201d the economist Nassim Taleb writes (those interested in complexity and fragility in economics should consider reading his books The Black Swan and Antifragile for a deeper view).\nIn this context, having even one currency that is free from political control can make a large difference. The purpose of Bitcoin is not simply to replace the fiat currency standard with a pure 21-st century gold standard; rather, the purpose is to add a measure of diversity by giving people a choice. If Bitcoin collapses, there will still be USD, stocks, bonds and gold are a store of wealth. If the \u201cmainstream\u201d economy collapses, Bitcoin\u2019s rise following the Cyprus incident shows well that Bitcoin serves as an effective hedge. The US dollar is not the endgame \u2013 history shows that few currency regimes last longer than about fifty years without going through fundamental changes like hose in 1933 and 1971, and neither is Bitcoin. But it is quite likely to be either part of the next solution or a stepping stone that will get us there.", "year": 2013, "month": 4, "day": 15}

With an expanding role of the federal government and onerous regulations continuing to cut off economic growth, the Bitcoin currency is a healthy alternative for individuals and businesses to turn to. The Bitcoin currency exemplifies the free market, pro-economic growth initiatives that our Founding Fathers had hoped to foster and promote through the Constitution which centered on safeguarding individuals from excess government intervention in their lives.As our nation is falling deeper into debt, individuals can no longer place their trust the US Federal Reserve.

This morning, PayPal President, David Marcus, expressed his fascination with Bitcoin and opened the door to a potential implementation of the up in coming online currency. As PayPal strives to remain the leader in innovative and convenient ordering and payment processing for individuals and merchants, we are prompted to wonder whether such a hunger for leadership and ingenuity will prompt PayPal\u2019s leadership to take the final jump to accept payments in the Bitcoin currency.\nMost recently, PayPal worked with Jamba Juice to develop a PayPal iPhone app to provide advanced order and payment options. In essence, customers, can locate a nearby Jamba Juice on their mobile devices, place an order, pay for their order, and have their juice ready to go upon arrival to the popular smoothy and fruit juice chain. Such a process would be expedited with the use of the Bitcoin currency. Without a need to go through multiple steps, interested customers merely need to use a Bitcoin wallet and scan a QR code to process payments.\nWhat attracts most to mobile payments is the convenience factor for merchants and customers. Additionally, having admitted that lines are blurring between online, mobile and offline payments, Marcus leads us to believe that PayPal may opt into the Bitcoin currency payment system based on digital wallets. Expressing an attentiveness to follow the ever changing lifestyles of customers, Marcus shared a potential interest in considering the Bitcoin currency and new payment techniques to meet customer needs. As convenience and relevancy is key, Bitcoin opens the door to expedite mobile transactions and save merchants and customers time and money.\nFurthermore, in light of a push for more convenient payment processing methods, PayPal is still mindful of customer and merchant security in transactions. In an age of growing identity theft, PayPal is working with Google and Lenovo in the FIDO Alliance to develop a technology that provides greater authenticating methods for online and mobile payment devices an option to prevent hackers from accessing accounts by stealing passwords. Marcus expressed that while looking to increase in its competitiveness and speed in processing transactions, PayPal is also working to develop a greater level of trust with merchants and customers.\nWe already know that Bitcoin is a secure method of payment. Spending with Bitcoins does not subject consumers to the same risk of identity theft as spending with credit cards. Credit card numbers and billing information can be stolen by identity thieves who assume people\u2019s identities and spend their money. With With bitcoin, people can simply send payment to a merchant\u2019s Bitcoin address without releasing any financial or personal information.\nMarcus has cracked open the door to further consideration of the PayPal\u2019s relationship with the Bitcoin currency.

A drastic side-effect of this heightened level of exposure in sharing elements of our humanity so viscerally with one another, around the world in an instant, is imminent, sickening heartbreak. Stories, images and video of unimaginable violence and suffering fill media news coverage globally driving the compassionate masses, at some point, to wish that there were a way to help. The bombing at the Boston Marathon spawned that horrific longing and helplessness in people across the United States and throughout the world. \u00a0Fortunately for the empathic and geographically remote there is now Bitcoin and, for this particular catastrophe, Trey Copeland, an American web developer created an emergency relief fund called\u00a0Bitcoins for Boston.\nAside from web development, I like hunting and fishing and write articles related to that at\u00a0Outdoorzy.com. Im also the previous owner of Featured Users, a twitter follower app, before selling it to Izea late last year. \u00a0Copeland said.\nUpon hearing the news of the explosions, Copeland was compelled to establish aid quickly and directly to the victims of the attack. \u00a0So, one thousand miles away from Boston, in Bowling Green, Kentucky, he created a two-page website with the singular purpose of raising money for\u00a0Boston Medical Center, one of the hospitals that has been treating the wounded people and will certainly be in need of resources. \u00a0According to Copeland, Its simple, Im trying to make the world suck less. \u00a0The people of Boston needed my help, so Im doing what I have to do to give them what they need. \u00a0The attacks happened at 2:50pm EDT and I had the website up with an address by 10pm EDT the same day.\nDonations have been a mainstay of the Bitcoin economy since the very early days and it makes sense because of the ease at which bitcoins can be sent with virtually no transaction fees. \u00a0Many big organizations have received\u00a0significant\u00a0donations to public addresses including Wikileaks, I2P, TorServers, The Internet Archive and Bitcoin Foundation, the latter which has received nearly as much as the prior four combined amounting to around 5,600 BTC. \u00a0Contributions made in bitcoin add up quickly and pack as much bang-for-your-buck as cash donations made directly.\nTo raise awareness and credibility\u00a0for the fundraising address, Copeland reached out to established groups in the world of Bitcoin and has received a supportive response from\u00a0Coinbase,\u00a0Trucoin\u00a0and\u00a0Bitcoin Foundation, as he explains, I first contacted the Bitcoin Foundation and Charlie Schrem of Bitinstant about the project. I received a response from Patrick Murck with the Foundation and he kind of gave me some direction and his opinions on the project. Overall, the response of the project has been great and everyone likes the idea.\nNow, Copeland is asking the Bitcoin community to step up and help reach his goal of $10,000 by May 15, 2013, one month after the tragedy, when he will sell the contributions at market price and hand the US dollars over to the hospital. \u00a0After the donation is made, a receipt from\u00a0Boston Medical Center will be posted online to be open and transparent on everything. \u00a0The monetary value of the actual donation will depend on the price that the bitcoins sell for when the time comes.\nOne strength that I see about Bitcoin right now is that the last traded price keeps increasing, which gives the value of each coin donated a higher amount than when originally sent in. Another thing is that its easy, quick and simple for someone with bitcoins to send a donation. \u00a0Copeland stated.\nEmergency donation funds like Bitcoins for Boston have fantastic potential to move funds to areas in need around the world. \u00a0Bitcoin is the quickest, easiest and most effective means by which to send money and those are vital properties for emergency fundraising. There is the wrinkle in the fact that, at this point in time, the bitcoins will likely need to be exchanged for fiat before ultimately becoming extremely useful in relief efforts, but that is easily overcome when trustworthy individuals like Trey Copeland step in to make the exchange fluid. \u00a0As Bitcoin becomes more widely used and accepted, emergency donations will become more immediately effective, until then, in the meantime, we can all help to make the world suck less by following Copelands lead and harness the power of Bitcoin for good.", "year": 2013, "month": 4, "day": 25}

He has bet a lot of intellectual and monetary capital on the Bitcoin revolution, which he supports not just because it is a technological advance in our financial infrastructure, but also because of the new hope for human liberty that it represents.\nBitcoin Magazine: How and when did you first hear about Bitcoin?\nRoger Ver: I first heard about Bitcoin in late 2010 on the www.freetalklive.com radio show / podcast.\nBM: Why is Bitcoin important? Why is it different?\nRV: Bitcoin is different from any other payment form in the history of mankind.For the first time in history, anyone can transact with anyone else, anywhere in the world, and it is impossible for a 3rd party to interfere in any way.\nBM: What makes you think that it will catch on?\nRV: All throughout history, people (thieves, kings, tax collectors) not directly involved in a transaction, have forcibly interfered in other people's transactions. Bitcoin now gives everyone on the planet the option of removing themselves from the arbitrary control of others.\nBM: What makes you think that it will last? Is it really that resilient?\nRV: The only reason Bitcoin wouldn't last would be because something even better comes along, so all the proponents of individual liberty still win. If Bittorrent is any example, the Bitcoin network really is that resilient.\nBM: Is Bitcoin really censorship-resistant? Can it thrive in, for example, China? Argentina?\nRV: It can thrive anywhere in the world with the internet. That currently includes China and Argentina. Even non-Bitcoin users would be rioting in the street if a government tried to cut them off from the internet.\nBM: Can Bitcoin scale? What will it need to support 100 million users?\nRV: Bitcoin can scale, but will surely experience some growing pains along the way. As it scales, there will be more and more people with a vested interest to help fix any issues that arise.\nBM: How will Bitcoin change the world? Describe your best-case scenario for Bitcoin 10-20 years from now.\nRV: Governments currently pay for their actions through theft (taxation), and counterfeiting (inflation). Bitcoin will make taxation much more difficult, and inflation impossible. More people were killed in the 20th century by their own governments than by all wars combined. The odds of you being murdered by a government, not including wars, is higher than your chance of dying from diabetes, alcohol, tobacco, traffic accidents, homicides, and just about all other single medical illnesses.In my ideal world, Bitcoin will bring an end to the nation state, allowing people across the world to deal with each other on a voluntary basis.\nBM: Do you consider Property a Natural Right (like Free Speech)? Or is it just an artificial legal construct? What about IP?\nRV: I believe that property is a natural right that stems from each individual's ownership of their own body.People own property when they mix their labor with something that was previously unowned, or voluntarily trade with others for existing property. I was persuaded by Murray Rothbard's arguments regarding IP. Patents are an illegitimate grant of monopoly privilege by the state. Copyright is a perfectly valid contractual agreement.\nBM: Medium of Exchange or Store of Value? If you had to choose just one of these two functions, which would you rather have Bitcoin be optimized for?\nRV: In most circumstances these have traditionally been two sides of the same coin. Bitcoin is currently better as a medium of exchange, but with time, I believe it will also become a store of value.\nBM: Are you worried about competition? Do you think that Bitcoin will be replaced by something better?\nRV: I hope Bitcoin is replaced by something even better for the same reason I hope my computer will be replaced by a better model in the future. Things being replaced by something better is what makes the world a better place.\nBM: What do you think will be the first big Bitcoin fork that really divides the community? Which side will you choose?\nRV: I don't know what will cause the first big fork, but I am sure that I will take the side that supports individual rights.\nBM: Can Bitcoin be hijacked and mutate into Fedcoin? Can it be centrally controlled?\nRV: I think this is unlikely since people can now voluntarily chose to use whatever crypto currency they want.\nBM: What Bitcoin projects are you currently involved in?\nRV: I've invested over $1M USD of my own money into over a dozen Bitcoin related startups.The most well known would be Bitcoinstore.com, Bitinstant.com, Bitpay.com, Blockchain.info, Coinlab.com, Bitcoinfoundation.org.

{"title": "Silk Road Under DDoS Attack", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/silk-road-under-ddos-attack/", "birthday": "May 1, 2013  12:34 PM EST", "date": "2013-05-01 17:34:00", "content": "The Silk Road, the\u00a0worlds largest online anonymous market\u00a0famous for its wide collection of illicit drugs and its use of Tor and Bitcoin to protect its users privacy, reports that it is currently being subjected to what may be the most powerful distributed denial-of-service attack against the site to date. The site has now been inaccessible for roughly two days, although\u00a0the official forums\u00a0continue to be online and some users have even reported brief intermittent periods of availability for the main site as well. One possible motivation behind the attack is a ransom attempt; Australian news media\u00a0is reporting\u00a0that the Silk Road had received a message demanding a payment of $5,000 on April 27. However, evidence of this is scant; the claim does not appear anywhere in Silk Road administrator Dread Pirate Roberts public forum posts, his primary (if not only) medium of public communication.\nRegarding the current status of the attack, Roberts has posted\u00a0a public update on the situation\u00a0on the official forum, writing the following:\nWe have come a long way in the battle, but still do not have the upper hand. Its looking more and more like a restructuring of the tor software or even the tor network will be required to mitigate the kind of attack we are under. If this can be solved by modifying the tor client software running the silk road .onion, then it will be a matter of patching and redeploying the hidden service. If it is a network issue, it will require the cooperation of the Tor developers, or running a new network of nodes. I havent given up hope for a faster solution, but if one can not be found, then we will move to a semi private scheme where users will be given access through many private URLs. Ill keep everyone updated on how we will move forward, but please be prepared for a few more days at the least of no access.\nThis is not the first major outage for Silk Road; in November 2012, following a combination of technical difficulties and a sudden growth in usage the website was down for an entire week. However, the words of Dread Pirate Roberts strongly suggest that this attack is not like the others. First of all, this is not the first DDoS attack to take place within the past week an earlier attack had taken the site down for 36 hours between April 24 and April 26. After successfully bringing the Silk Road back online, Dread Pirate Roberts released\u00a0a public message\u00a0announcing his victory and even praising the attackers intellect, writing I have zero respect for the attackers tactics, but I have huge respect for his intellect, giving me confidence that we can and will overcome any future technology-based attacks on Silk Road. The short time difference between this last attack and the current one, and the fact that both attacks have managed to bring the site down for over 36 hours, provides some evidence suggesting that the perpetrators of the two attacks are one and the same. This paints a grim picture of the assailant: a person, or organization, that is highly intelligent, has a lot of resources at their disposal, and is not willing to give up.\nSecond, the fact that Dread Pirate Roberts is even talking about moving to a semi-private scheme that is, requiring users to jump through hoops to obtain a Tor address at which to access the site, is another sign that this attack is very serious. One of the main attractions of the Silk Road is that anyone, even those who have no connections or knowledge of where to find illicit products on the street, can purchase a wide assortment of goods from an interface that is, once Tor and Bitcoin are set up, no harder to use than Amazon or eBay. Requiring new users to, say, go on\u00a0reddit.com/r/silkroad\u00a0and ask for a semi-private address to access the site would seriously hamper adoption and, equally importantly, create a central point of failure. Law enforcement could easily pressure Reddit to take down r/silkroad and play a constant cat-and-mouse game with the Silk Road community as they attempt to find other portals on which to set up a public entrance point a game that law enforcement would never be able to win, but which would nevertheless make it even more difficult for new users to join.\nIn the meantime, there are two other online black markets available that Silk Road users can use as a fallback: Black Market Reloaded and Atlantis. Black Market Reloaded recently\u00a0released statistics\u00a0that showed that the site was doing quite well: its monthly trade volume is now up to $750,000 per month, over a third of the\u00a0$2 million per month figure\u00a0estimated for Silk Road by Carnegie Mellon researchers last summer. Its selection of goods is now as large as that of Silk Road, as since Silk Roads last major outage in November a large number of Silk Road sellers have started maintaining profiles on both. However, the infrastructure is not yet as well-developed; some Silk Road users complain that Black Market Reloaded has a much weaker consumer protection framework and it is harder to find vendors with an established reputation that can be trusted. Atlantis is currently very small; the site was only released\u00a0this year in March, and less than a thousand different goods are offered for sale. Its main attraction: supporting\u00a0Litecoin\u00a0as well as Bitcoin.\nOf course, these two markets themselves are safe from attack; if the attacker currently targeting the Silk Road is doing so with the intent of disrupting all Tor-based crypto-commerce, they can easily add Black Market Reloaded and Atlantiss Tor addresses to their list of targets and expand the attack. It is likely that the two fledgling competitors would fare even more poorly than the Silk Road, as they have not had the prior experience handling DDoS attacks than the Silk Road had. As for the Silk Road itself, the latest word from Dread Pirate Roberts is that he is\u00a0still working on a solution.\u00a0Whether the Silk Road will emerge from this attack unscathed or not is a question the answer to which is unfolding with each passing second, and tens of thousands of people are watching to find out.", "year": 2013, "month": 5, "day": 1}

In the run-up to June 9, it seemed as though everything was going well for Bitcoin. There was some negative media attention regarding Silk Road, but even there many of the articles were positive, detailing the potential of the website rather than fearing governmental attack. Around June 3, prices started rising super-exponentially increasing from $10 to $30 in less than a week. After the crash on June 9, however, everything seemed to go wrong at the same time. Half a dozen major Bitcoin services were hacked all at once, MtGox went down for nearly a week, and media attention quickly turned sour as a result. \nThis time, the situation is similar. During the three days during which the Bitcoin price fell from $266 to $60, nearly every Bitcoin exchange was subject to heavy stress, with MtGox being inaccessible for ten hours and BitStamp, BitFloor and BTC-E for one to three. Three Bitcoin exchanges saw their bank accounts closed for legal reasons, and Bitcoin Central lost several hundred BTC in a hack. Bitcoin's critics, who had remained strangely silent while the currency was still going up to its new all-time high, came out of the woodworks to criticize the currency as soon as the price started falling on April 10. Google Trends volume, after seeing a new all-time high, is now once again back to the same levels that it saw in mid-March.\nHowever, there are also signs of hope. Unlike after the previous crash, dozens of new businesses have started accepting Bitcoin, and many columnists even came out to defend Bitcoin, or at the very least the idea of cryptocurrency more generally. News reports of venture capital investors being interested in Bitcoin are only continuing to increase in number. It's a claim repeated often both here and elsewhere that there is simply no way to tell where Bitcoin will go from here; for now, perhaps it's best to simply enjoy the ride.\nBubble and Crash\nThe Bitcoin price struck a new all-time high of $266.00 on April 10, 2011, before falling back to a low of $54.25 on April 12 and $50.01 on April 16 and recovering to $120-$140 by the end of the month.Trade volume hit an all-time high even if denominated in BTC, breaking the November 2011 record of 382,186 BTC with two spikes of 556,289 BTC and 572,185 BTC on April 12 and 16, respectively. The USD-denominated daily volume record was on April 12, at a total of $47.6 million.The Google Trends volume set a new high at nearly 4 times June 2011 levels, before quickly falling back down to slightly above the June 2011 peak by the end of the month.The number of transactions excluding popular addresses a metric used by blockchain.info to measure Bitcoin transaction activity not including very heavy blockchain-using applications like SatoshiDice, hit a new high of 50,338 on April 11. Other metrics stayed roughly stagnant from March.Alternative cryptocurrency Litecoin hit an all-time high of $5.89 USD before falling back to about $4, and Ripple's internal currency XRP hit a high of 0.72 cents. Note that both of these currencies will have a larger number of currency units in circulation than Bitcoin; Litecoin's final money supply will be 84 million, and the XRP 100 billion, compared to Bitcoin's 21 million.\nGrowth from the Inside\nThe popular Bitcoin electronics retailer BitcoinStore sold 2184 BTC (~$300,000) worth of products in the month of April, putting them roughly on target to hit their goal of $850,000 by June 30.The popular Bitcoin payment processor BitPay announced that they have passed 5,000 merchants.Amagi Metals, a precious metals seller that started accepting Bitcoin at the end of last year, announced that they have sold over $750,000 worth of products between April 1 and April 26, including a record of over $220,000 in a single day.For the first time, another country briefly overtook the United States with the largest number of downloads for the Bitcoin-Qt client. The country in question: China. China has also seen trade volume on its exchanges increase by a factor of thirty these past four months, compared to a finally began shipping their long-awaited ASIC mining hardware. Although power consumption turned out to be roughly six times higher than originally planned, and physical weight and volume two times greater, the devices are still somewhat more efficient, and much cheaper, than those offered by Avalon.\"The Daily Bitcoin\", a new daily podcast discussing issues from all sides of the Bitcoin ecosystem, started releasing episodes.\n...And From the Outside\nThe popular online dating site OkCupid has started accepting Bitcoin as payment for its premium \"A-List\" service, offering special features somewhat similar to Reddit Gold. A major Danish dating site, singles.dk, quickly followed suit.The popular softcore-porn site MetArt started accepting Bitcoin (link safe) along with its siter sites.PayPal's chief director David Marcus stated on TV that PayPal was considering integrating Bitcoin as a funding option. Western Union and MoneyGram also expressed interest in the currency.The Libertarian Party of Canada started accepting Bitcoin donations, and a potential Libertarian Party candidate for the 2016 election in the United States announced that he would only be accepting precious metals, Bitcoin and Litecoin donations.Salon Supply Store and IWannaBuy became the first retailers in South Africa and China, respectively, to accept Bitcoin.The One Foundation became the first Chinese charity to accept Bitcoin donations, receiving $30,000 within two days. Two local US charities, the homeless outreach group Sean's Outpost and Bitcoins for Boston, started taking bitcoins as well.The Pirate Bay started accepting Bitcoin donations, placing a Bitcoin address on their front page and raising over 14 BTC ($1,800) in the week following the initial announcement. Other torrent sites have quickly followed suit, although with less success due to their comparatively lower popularity.\nScandals And Hacks\nBitcoin mining malware was detected spreading through Skype, and plain old Bitcoin stealing malware also became increasingly prevalent.In the aftermath of the April 10 crash, nearly all major exchanges were overwhelmed by massive spikes in usage combined with multiple denial-of-service attacks. Bitcoin exchanges are still in the process of upgrading their systems to be able to handle the new volume.The Bitcoin exchange BitFloor saw its bank account closed down, leading founder Roman Shtylman to close the exchange for good and start returning deposits. Cavirtex and CADBitcoin in Canada also saw their accounts closed down, although the other major Canadian exchange, LibertyBit, remains confident that they are \"in full compliance with Canadian laws\" and a bank account closure is unlikely to happen to them.The European Bitcoin exchange Bitcoin24 saw its Polish bank account closed, and its owner under suspicion by German financial authorities for embezzling clients' funds for personal use.The Bitcoin wallet provider Instawallet, which offered the easy to use but very insecure scheme of using a URL as a sort of \"password\" to its wallets, saw these URLs leaked in a database breach, and the attackers immediately proceeded to clean out Instawallet users' funds.Bitcoin Central was hacked through its VPS provider OVH, leading to \"a few hundred BTC\" of losses. The site is shutting down until what its owners expect to be some time this summer to upgrade their security systems.The Bitcoin and Tor-based \"anonymous market\" Silk Road fell under two consecutive DDoS attacks, and was taken offline for a total of roughly four days. However, in both cases administrator Dread Pirate Roberts was able to bring the site back online, declaring a sale to celebrate the first of the two victories.", "year": 2013, "month": 5, "day": 1}
{"title": "Chinese \u201cOne Foundation\u201d First to Accept Bitcoin, Receives $30,000", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/chinese-one-foundation-first-to-accept-bitcoin-receives-30000-1367015982/", "birthday": "Apr 26, 2013  6:39 PM EST", "date": "2013-04-26 23:39:00", "content": "The One Foundation, the first officially recognized private charitable fundraising organization operating in China, has now also become the first Chinese organization to start accepting Bitcoin donations. The organization published a donation address on April 23, and received 230 BTC ($30,000) within two days, instantly making it one of the most successful Bitcoin charities to date.\nThe One Foundation was originally created in 2007 by renowned Chinese film actor Jet Li, who then took a year off film-making in 2008 to promote the foundation. Private fundraising organizations are highly regulated in China - even now most applications to create one are simply rejected, so for the first three years of its operation the One Foundation was not even an independent organization; instead, it operated under the umbrella of the Red Cross Society of China, a government-connected organization operated by the Ministry of Health. However, its partnership with the Chinese Red Cross was a restrictive one. \"Jet Li complained that the One Foundation had little say in deciding on the use of money it had raised,\" Xinhuanet's Wu Chen and Wu Caixia write. \"According to his plan, his foundation sought to focus more on supporting domestic grass-roots NGOs, which lack both money and professionals, while the Red Cross Society of China is an organization paying more attention to disaster relief.\"\nIn 2009, the Chinese government started a trial project in its \"special economic zone\" in Shenzhen to streamline the registration process, allowing the local government of Shenzhen to register foundations - a power previously only held by the federal government. Shenzhen authorities were willing to work with the One Foundation, and it was finally able to register as an independent foundation in 2010. In 2011, the Chinese Red Cross's reputation was damaged by a scandal in which a 20-year-old claiming to be the \"commerce general manager\" of the organization, Meimei Guo, publicly flaunted artefacts of an extravagant lifestyle that many assumed had been paid for with charity money (it was later discovered that she was the girlfriend of someone involved with the Red Cross; he has since resigned). Concerns over government corruption and extravagance are common in China; the Chinese Red Cross is administered by the Chinese Ministry of Health, and so its employees gain the \"iron rice bowl\" guaranteed job security and welfare benefits of public servants - benefits that many feel are undeserved when ordinary Chinese working outside government agencies have little of either welfare benefits or job security. The Meimei Guo incident reignited these concerns, and two investigations into the matter was carried out.\nWhen the Ya'an earthquake struck in April 2013, the total lack of confidence in the Chinese Red Cross became painfully clear. \"Right after the quake,\" Financial Times columnist Julie Zhu writes, the RCSC said on Weibo, China\u2019s answer to Twitter, that it had sent a team to 'inspect' the quake-hit region. Tens of thousands of Chinese microbloggers fired comments back. The message from most of them: 'Get lost'\". \"As an ordinary citizen, I will never donate a penny to the Red Cross Society,\u201d one user of Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, wrote, and another added \u201cThe RCSC is shameless. The earthquake is terrible enough. We don\u2019t need you to \u2018inspect\u2019. Get out of our sight.\" By the end of the day, the agency had received only $23,000 worth of donations. Because of its past relationship with the Chinese Red Cross, the One Foundation also took some of the reputational damage from the Guo Meimei incident; its staff had to frantically rush to remove an old Red Cross link from their site when a user stumbled upon it. However, at the same time the foundation is quietly gaining credibility as an alternative, although both organizations are careful to avoid outright competing with each other for individuals' donations.\nSoon after the earthquake struck, the One Foundation also decided to try something new: accept donations in bitcoin. The organization released the address on April 21, and within two days it received over 230 BTC - marking what appears to be the first significant Chinese Bitcoin fundraising drive in history. \"Welcome geeks and hackers' bitcoin donations to the One Foundation,\" a representative wrote in a brief reply written in Chinese when asked about the donation address by Bitcoin Magazine. The 230 BTC donated are worth about $30,000 today; when compared with the agency's total receipts of $2.4 million USD, this means that, within the scope of this particular fundraising drive, Bitcoin was responsible for an entire 1% of China's largest independent charity's revenue. The amount was not even from a single donor; the three largest donations were 88, 39 and 25 BTC respectively, but all other donations were 10 BTC or lower. Given that the organization had started accepting Bitcoin quietly, with no news of its Bitcoin acceptance or even the earthquake in the English-speaking Bitcoin media, this leads to an important question: where did the donations come from? There seems to be only one logical answer: a growing, and already quite developed, Bitcoin community in China itself.\nThere are also other signs that point to a massive surge of interest in Bitcoin in the Chinese community. Just like everywhere else, interest in Bitcoin according to standard indicators like Google Trends and exchange trade volume has risen massively over the past four months, but in fact Bitcoin in China is growing even faster than elsewhere. While trade volume at the leading exchange MtGox peaked at about 10 times January volume during the peak two weeks ago, trade volume on BTCChina increased by a factor of 30. April 23 became the first day that any country downloaded the reference Bitcoin client more than the United States; the country in question was China.\nThere are a number of reasons to believe China has solid potential to take up Bitcoin. The Chinese already have experience with virtual currency in the form of QQ Coin, although that particular attempt at virtual currency was eventually crippled by Chinese regulatory authorities. Bitcoin may enable Chinese users to evade currency controls to a much greater extent than previous centralized systems like QQ Coin ever did. Earning or trading virtual currencies in video games is also a popular occupation; the archetype of a \"Chinese gold farmer\" collecting in-game assets in massively multiplayer online games to sell for profit is quite real.\nThe greatest hope, however, lies in bridging the Chinese and Western worlds. Most of North America and Europe are standardized on a number of proprietary platforms for payment: PayPal, Visa and Mastercard come to mind. China has its own equivalents; Alipay is perhaps the best known. Bitcoin will not fix the language barrier between the two worlds, but it can certainly make economic interaction much more seamless; a store catering to Chinese expats called IWannaBuy started accepting bitcoins only a few weeks ago. Bitcoin may even end up being a significant boost for the entire Chinese non-profit sector; charitable donations in China currently only amount to about 0.09% of GDP, so the fact that Bitcoin opens the door for these organizations to receive international donations - from, say, Chinese expatriates living in Canada and the US with families still in China, opens an opportunity for Bitcoin and Chinese charity at the same time. The Bitcoin community has just shown that it alone is willing, and able, to donate as much to the One Foundation as all of China did to the Chinese Red Cross - suggesting that Bitcoin may play a significant role in China's non-profit, and perhaps even for-profit, sectors in the years to come.

The original plan had been for Coinlab to take over all of MtGox\u2019s operations in Canada and the United States, using its business relationships and marketing experience, as well as a local banking presence, to better provide for North American customers while still using MtGox\u2019s technical infrastructure and leveraging the company\u2019s established brand. The monetary side of the agreement, as we now know, is a revenue sharing arrangement in which revenues from existing MtGox customers in the US and Canada are split 60/40 between MtGox and Coinlab (in MtGox\u2019s favor), and revenues from new customers are split 90/10 in Coinlab\u2019s favor. However, almost right from the start it was obvious that things were not quite going according to plan. Coinlab\u2019s takeover of MtGox\u2019s existing US and Canadian customers was supposed to have concluded by March 22, but the date came and went and nothing appeared to change. Coinlab was quiet about the details of the process, and throughout the rest of March and April progress continued to stagnate, and Coinlab and MtGox were both silent on the matter. Now, it appears as though the delays have pushed Coinlab itself to the breaking point, and now in this way the company\u2019s executives have decided to take action.\nThere are two main parts to Coinlab\u2019s claim. First, the company claims that MtGox has utterly failed at living up to its side of the bargain in helping the transition go smooothly. Excerpting from the relevant section of the lawsuit:\n28) Mt. Gox has failed to cooperate in facilitating the timely and seamless transfer of CoinLab Customers to Coinlab since the Agreement took effect.30) Defendants have breached their promises to provide necessary technology, software, and know-how to CoinLab and have refused or failed to establish promised connections from CoinLab\u2019s computer network to Mt. Gox\u2019s computer network.32) Despite repeated requests to do so, Mt. Gox has failed to deliver all passwords,Yubikeys, administrative logins and any other security information required so that CoinLabmay assume operation of the Bitcoin exchange services for customers in the United States and Canada in case of a service interruption.\nThe list goes on, giving a series of contractual duties that Coinlab claims MtGox has failed to comply with. The other major claim in the suit is more interesting. In the original contract between Coinlab and MtGox there is a clause stating the following:\nF. 1 During the Term, MtGox and Tibanne shall not grant anyone the right to use the Licensed Materials to provide the Services, or any part thereof, in the Territory. The exclusivity granted herein shall apply strictly to Services targeting the Territory and the CoinLab Customers (as de\ufb01ned below) and advertised and sold as such. It shall not include the provision of Services to users of the Services who, depending on the interpretation or circumstances, may or may not be considered CoinLab Customers.\nThe contract also included a similar clause binding Coinlab, preventing Coinlab or its owners from operating another exchange independent of the agreement. These clauses are key; without them, MtGox or Coinlab could both attempt to draw customers from the Coinlab-operated North American MtGox to a separate exchange not bound by the revenue-sharing agreement, and so deprive the other of all revenue. Another clause later in the contract states that that \u201cit may be impossible to determine the monetary harm suffered by the non-breaching Party\u201d if Coinlab or MtGox violate either of these key clauses, and instead sets a specific figure that either party would be liable for in the event that they breach the contract: $50 million USD.\nIn the lawsuit, Coinlab claims: \u201cDefendants have, in email and other written exchanges, and in public statementsto the press acknowledged that they have directly serviced customers in the United States and Canada since entering the Agreement. This conduct constitutes a breach of the Agreement, including the exclusivity provisions in the Agreement.\u201d Combining this with MtGox\u2019s alleged failure to transfer the necessary technical materials, the total value claimed in the suit is a sky-high $75 million.\nMtGox\u2019s defense against this claim will likely come in several parts. First of all, the transfer was never completed, and so there is no reason to believe tha Coinlab suffered actual damages from MtGox continuing to serve customers directly in the meantime. The $50 million figure in the contract does not depend on the transfer actually having taken place, but judges are known to cut down such pre-set damages in certain circumstances. Second, although the clause stating that \u201cMtGox and Tibanne shall not grant anyone the right to use the Licensed Matrials to provide the services\u201d certainly forbids MtGox from acquiring another partner and executing a second Coinlab-like relationship within North America at the same time, it is debatable whether \u201cgranting anyone the right\u201d includes providing services to North American customers themselves. MtGox already had the right to use their own \u201cLicensed Materials\u201d to provide their own services, so it is not at all clear that exercising that pre-existing right constitutes granting the right.\nThere is a distinction between a \u201csole license\u201d and an \u201cexclusive license\u201d in intellectual property; as described by TransLegal, \u201ca sole license is a type of exclusive license where the licensor remains entitled to use the licensed subject within the territory of exclusivity, i.e., unlike in a typical exclusive license, the licensor generally retains the right to use the intellectual property.\u201d However, this distinction is an esoteric one, and if the word \u201cexclusive\u201d was used in the contract with this definition in mind it is not particularly well supported by the content of section F.1. It is quite likely that there was a genuine misunderstanding between Coinlab and MtGox regarding this matter.\nFinally, there is the possibility of other technicalities. For example, the contract includes a clause stating that \u201cCoinLab shall operate the Services in the Territory in compliance with all applicable laws after completion of the Transition Period and MtGox shall cooperate fully with CoinLab in achieving such compliance.\u201d It would be difficult for Coinlab to be literally 100% compliant already; FINCEN\u2019s March 2013 guidance essentially states that all exchanges serving the entire Unites States are required to have money transmitter licenses in all 48 states that require them, a process which requires millions of dollars in surety bonds. However, Peter Vessenes claims in the lawsuit that \u201cCoinLab is registered with FinCEN to provide Bitcoin exchange services in the United States and has fully complied with FinCEN\u2019s March 2013 guidance for digital currency exchanges.\u201d\nCoinlab CEO Peter Vessenes has written a personal statement (backup) on the matter, writing the following:\n\u201cIn the last month, many of you have contacted me directly and asked for more details on our transition, and I would say (charitably) that I\u2019ve been frustratingly vague \u2014 I just haven\u2019t been able to talk about it \u2026What tipped us into filing was our complete inability to get Mt. Gox to deliver on the few simple things left that were needed for customers to move over en-masse; we were often left just apologizing to our alpha customers while their own businesses suffered \u2026What I hope is that Mt. Gox has this same interest in the good of Bitcoin, and Bitcoiners, and finds a way to work this out.\u201d\nMark Karpeles has only provided a brief comment, writing in an email to Gawker: \u201cWe have not been served nor notified of such a lawsuit (except from your email), so it is difficult for us to comment at this point in time. We will review this within the next hours.\u201d\nThe most harmful part of the ordeal to the Bitcoin community at large, aside from the drop in Bitcoin price and the negative press attention, is that this will prove to be a serious blow to the Bitcoin Foundation. Peter Vessenes is currently also the Executive Director of the foundation, and MtGox CEO Mark Karpeles is himself a board member. The fact that the official head of the Bitcoin Foundation is moving towards a lawsuit first, not even trying to resolve the dispute through any kind of internal arbitration within the Bitcoin community, suggests a striking lack of coherence within the foundation as a whole. The organization has already been relatively passive since the initial fanfare subsided in the later months of 2012, but this incident suggests that, in its present form, it exists nowhere but on paper. What the Bitcoin Foundation now needs the most is strong leadership; it is currently still the organization in the best position to unify the Bitcoin community and push it forward, but without clear direction it only risks falling further into idleness and internal strife. There have been increasing calls for Peter Vessenes to step down in part for this reason, and given the inherent conflict of interest between being a semi-official head of the Bitcoin community and having an active lawsuit against its largest business, the arguments for such a move have only strengthened. The main problem is, however, that there is nothing close to a clear consensus on who can replace him.\nHopefully, as Vessenes says, the two companies will be able to resolve their differences peacefully without resorting to further advances toward legal channels. The most likely explanation for MtGox\u2019s failure to live up to its agreement is simply that the exchange was overwhelmed with a sudden influx of customers in March and massive spikes in usage and multiple denial-of-service attacks in April \u2013 the same reason why the exchange was unable to upgrade its servers in time for April 10. This does not fully excuse MtGox\u2019s failures in both the Coinlab affair and their own exchange \u2013 it is clear that the company should have quickly taken on more staff in February and March if they were uncertain that they would be able to meet their responsibilities \u2013 but it does mean that the root cause of both failures was a simple mistake rather than willful malfeasance. As long as MtGox remains the most powerful exchange in the Bitcoin economy, their ability to serve customers around the world remains crucial to Bitcoin\u2019s continued success, and so no matter what our personal feelings toward MtGox or Vessenes may be we should all wish for the best possible outcome.", "year": 2013, "month": 5, "day": 3}

This is NOT a change to the Bitcoin protocol, it is a change to default transaction inclusion and propagation rules. If you can get your transaction to a miner willing to bend these rules, you will get included in the blockchain (although it will be inconvenient for you). 2. There is another justification given for adding a minimum transaction size: many new users end up receiving very small quantities of bitcoin from free bitcoin sites and are unable to spend them because the total amount is less than the minimum transaction fee for sending small amounts. This patch will eliminate this problem. 3. This is actually a softened version of a previous change that would have the 5430 satoshi minimum hardcoded with no option for individual miners to customize it without editing and recompiling source code, and so is already an improvement. Any expressed or implied criticism was directed at the original introduction of the minimum, not this particular patch.\nSee criticism of this article and my replies (and so on) at http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1drnvp/bitcoin_developers_adding_0007_minimum/, and feel free to make your own judgement.\nAbout a week ago, lead Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen quietly introduced a patch that would add a fairly significant change to the transaction propagation rules: any transaction with any of its outputs less than 5430 satoshis (0.00005430 BTC) would be classified as non-standard, and will not be included or further propagated across the network by default miners. The minimum is a setting that individual miners are free to change (including to zero), and such transactions will remain valid under the rules of the Bitcoin protocol, but with only non-standard miners and miners that bother to change default settings including them in blocks and even passing them along to other nodes it will take much longer for them to get accepted (ie. \u201cconfirmed\u201d) by the Bitcoin blockchain.\nThe main motivation for the patch is the same as that for many of the other rules restricting transaction propagation and inclusion in default miners: to fight \u201ctransaction spam\u201d. One of the more problematic aspects of Bitcoin is that every transaction ever made will need to be stored by every fully participating node in the Bitcoin network forever, and already the size of the Bitcoin blockchain is over 7 gigabytes. Thus. there is an understandable desire to attempt to limit transactions that are deemed to be more trouble to store and verify than they\u2019re worth. Some rules, like one added three months ago to make transactions that are over 100,000 bytes in size non-standard, exist to block single transactions that would cause an excessive amount of computing power to process and hard disk space to store. Others serve to discourage features of the Bitcoin protocol that are not well-tested. This one, however, serves a slightly different purpose: to block transactions that are perfectly ordinary in format and size, but which provide an extremely small benefit to the sender.\nA substantial portion of Bitcoin transactions will be affected; a chart linked in Gavin\u2019s pull request shows that about 20% of all recent transactions are under the threshold. By far the main user of such small outputs is the popular Bitcoin gambling site SatoshiDice. All bets on SatoshiDice take place directly over the blockchain; the bettor sends any amount of bitcoins between 0.01 and (usually) 500 to one of SatoshiDice\u2019s addresses, if the bet wins, the original bet multiplied by the prize multiplier is sent back, and if the bet loses the bettor would receive 1 satoshi to let them know that they did, in fact, lose the bet, and their transaction was not lost due to some kind of error on the part of SatoshiDice or the Bitcoin network. SatoshiDice is prepared; the site has already increased the size of their \u201closs notification\u201d transactions from 1 satoshi to 0.00005 BTC.\nAlso affected will be the colored coins project. The colored coins project\u2019s core idea is to assign additional value to extremely small amounts of bitcoin; one application would be to \u201ctag\u201d ten thousand specific satoshis and then use them to represent shares of a corporation. One single satoshi can be used to represent smart property. Now, in order to achieve the same granularity what could be done with a single satoshi before would now need to be done with a block of 5430. However, in the discussion on this patch on Github, colored coins developer Alex Mizrahi commented: \u201cI don\u2019t think this change will create significant problems for \u2018colored coins\u2019. I mean, it\u2019s strange that you\u2019re doing this, but I guess we can live with it.\u201d Although this will increase the expense of creating shares, it will not overshadow all other expenses; each individual colored coins transaction already required a 10,000 satoshi transaction fee in order to get included into the network without unreasonable delay.\nIn both cases, however, from both the Github discussion and conversations elsewhere it is clear that many core Bitcoin developers have a dim view of both SatoshiDice\u2019s loss notification mechanism and colored coins being in the Bitcoin network. One poster said, \u201cpersonally I think that a \u2018colored coin\u2019 solution lies in alt-chains and using the main BTC block chain is not appropriate for this application\u201d, echoing a commonly held belief that Bitcoin is meant to be used to send payments and not information. Jeff Garzik added in response to another comment, \u201cIt is not breaking fundamentals \u2014 bitcoin has never ever been a micro-transaction or micro-payment system\u201d.\nHere, however, the developers have already gathered some criticism. Although this patch has been pushed relatively quietly so far, as though the change was simply a routine and uncontroversial optimization, the community\u2019s position on these matters is far from settled; indeed, the two questions of (1) whether or not transmitting information using Bitcoin is legitimate, and if so just how much information is okay, and (2) whether or not Bitcoin should be used for micro-transactions are highly disputed matters. To show this, note that what appears to be an opposing view was held by Satoshi Nakamoto himself:\nCompletely non-reversible transactions [in pre-Bitcoin payment systems] are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-reversible services.\nOne of the original purposes of Bitcoin was thus micro-transactions, as stated by Satoshi himself.\nOf course, the issue is somewhat more complicated than this, as there are actually two distinct uses of the term micro-transactions at play. The first can more accurately be termed milli-transactions; these are small payments on the order of $0.01 to $0.99, and transactions of this size are frequently used to pay for songs and mobile applications and to give tips through Bitcointip. It would indeed be a tragedy if these uses were hampered by a minimum size restriction of fee, but these are fortunately not harmed by this scheme. The second is transactions that are even smaller; one might imagine a computer paying a smartphone 100 satoshis per kilobyte in exchange for being able to borrow the smartphone\u2019s cellular internet connection. These are the kinds of transactions that Bitcoin was actually never intended for, and which are better done with either some kind of centralized off-blockchain clearing mechanism or a repreatedly-adjusted transaction mechanism as described in the Bitcoin wiki\u2019s page on contracts.\nWhere disagreement lies is twofold. First, there is the question of just how small a milli-transaction needs to be before it becomes a micro-transaction. On the one side are Bitcoin developers like Peter Todd, who stated in the Github thread that \u201cWe do need better communication of this stuff, and that includes doing things like taking \u2018Low or zero processing fees\u2019 off of bitcoin.org and not talking about microtransactions.\u201d The argument in Todd\u2019s favor was already mentioned; restricting as many low-value transactions as possible keeps the size of the Bitcoin blockchain down, mitigating the need for Bitcoin users to move away from \u201cfull clients\u201d to \u201clight clients\u201d which do not store the Bitcoin blockchain themselves and instead rely on third-party servers to do much of the legwork. On the other side are those who see low processing fees and smaller minimum transaction sizes as being among Bitcoin\u2019s cardinal features, for which it is even worth it to give up the idea that anyone other than a miner or business will be actually storing the full Bitcoin blockchain. The argument that this group makes is that most users have migrated off the \u201cSatoshi client\u201d maintained by the core developers to \u201clight clients\u201d like Electrum and Blockchain already, and it is a fool\u2019s game to attempt to forestall this trend.\nThe other question is that of alternative uses of the Bitcoin protocol. The solution used to limit low-value transactions before this move toward an outright ban was transaction fees, and this mechanism had the advantage that, rather than outright banning any particular uses that are deemed \u201cwasteful\u201d, it allows the sender themselves to decide whether or not sending the transaction brings enough benefit to them to be worth the public cost. Here, no such individual judgement is possible, and so in order for a Bitcoin transaction to be deemed \u201cvaluable enough\u201d to be allowed into the blockchain it must at least appear to be a substantial transfer of Bitcoin-denominated monetary value. The fact that colored coins users might benefit more from sending single satoshis than some other users benefit by moving around entire bitcoins, while the public storage cost for both types of transactions is the same, is not reflected in this rather blunt style of regulation. The argument used by developers, once again, is that Bitcoin is only intended to be a system for storing and sending money, and other uses belong on alternative blockchains better suited to their individual purposes.\nIt may well be that a community consensus will emerge that Bitcoin is a network for sending money and nothing but money, and substantial amounts of money too. However, so far no such consensus exists, and these questions remain very much up for debate. Because of its limited scope, and its nature as a modifiable miner setting, this particular patch is not particularly important, but it does highlight the importance of these long-standing issues that still remain unresolved. Exactly what minimum size of transactions should Bitcoin target itself toward, and should it aim for virtually no fees? Is the use of the Bitcoin network to send trivial amounts of information, whether that may be information about ownership in the form of a colored coins transaction or a loss notification from SatoshiDice, something that we want to accept? Exactly what balance we strike with each of these questions is a crucially important decision that will affect the course that Bitcoin will take for decades to come, and it is very important that we as a community have solid communication, and genuine two-way discussion, when these kinds of issues arise.", "year": 2013, "month": 5, "day": 6}

On day one, BitPremier is featuring a Bahamas Resort Ocean View Condo, Trump Soho Hotel Condominium, paintings such as LeRoy Neiman Basketball Stars, and designer watches as jewelry such as a Ulysse Nardin GMT Perpetual Watch. One of the best features of the site is the continuously updated BTC price along with the USD price.\nThe overall imaging of the site is conducive to sale of high quality products: a black and white color scheme, leaving the rest of the space up to each merchant to fill in with a vibrant picture of their real estate, art work, or upscale product. The simple design allows merchants to highlight their luxurious products and sites. As BitPremier\u2019s mission is to provide Bitcoin currency holders access to unique, high-end luxury items, each merchant has a generous feature page to highlight their product. The site also has built-in features to safeguard merchants and customers through keeping both parties anonymous until the transaction is near completion. Due to the higher prices associated with merchandise, BitPremier does offer escrow services to secure payment on items until both parties have fully signed off on the purchase. In addition to ad placement on the BitPremier website, merchants can also be featured on BitPremier\u2019s Twitter and Facebook pages.\nBitcoin Magazine had the opportunity to interview Alan Silbert of BitPremier.\nBitcoin Magazine : When did you first hear about and get involved in the Bitcoin currency?Alan Silbert: Earlier this year Bitcoins were brought to my attention as something that could have enormous potential. I started digging in, and became more and more intrigued with the concept. I now firmly believe that Bitcoins are going to be a game-changer and a big disruptor in finance.\nBM: How did you first get involved in the Bitcoin currency?AS: Outside of schooling myself on Bitcoin 101 day and night, I started as an investor in the currency. I made a point to test drive the different exchanges to understand the complexities of Bitcoin.\nBM: When did you first get the idea for BitPremier and what inspired you to create the site?AS: The idea has been in the works for a couple months. There is really nothing out there quite like BitPremier, so we were glad to jump in and fill the void. We want to open the door to unique items for the Bitcoin community that people don\u2019t have access to today. There are a lot of Bitcoins out there, and people need somewhere to spend them. We think BitPremier.com will fill that need by providing a central go-to marketplace for these higher-end goods and services.\nBM: Were there any preexisting businesses that inspired you to create BitPremier?AS: 1stdibs, James Edition, and the Dupont Registry are good models for luxury marketplaces. Those are great sites for unique purchases.\nBM: Where do you see BitPremier\u2019s services going in a year?AS: We will of course firmly plant ourselves as THE Bitcoin luxury go-to site! I have a few ideas of where we are going. Stay tuned . . .\nBM: What makes BitPremier stand out in comparison to other sites utilizing the Bitcoin currency?AS: BitPremier is a one-of-a-kind site, so there is nothing similar in the market right now to compare us to. It opens up to the Bitcoin community a whole new realm of possibilities of where to spend their Bitcoins, and provides sellers of luxury items with a mostly untapped $1B+ market of buyers to sell to. We screen listings to provide buyers with the best experience possible, and act as escrow agent to facilitate a safe transaction where everyone is happy.\nBM: What are your suggestions for individuals hoping to start a business like BitPremier?AS: Research Bitcoins inside and out, because there is plenty to learn and a lot of tech-speak. But there are tons of possibilities. We are only at the beginning of the curve, so the opportunities out there for entrepreneurs to build out the Bitcoin ecosystem are endless.\nBM: If I am a merchant looking to sell through your site, how can I get started?AS: Sellers can check out the \u201cHow it Works\u201d page on BitPremier.com to get acquainted with the site and review our listing criteria. Sellers can then register through our \u201cSeller Signup\u201d page to submit their listings. We reach out to the seller, verify the listing, edit it, and post it on the site. Or if they have questions or multiple listings, they can contact us at [email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=\"currentScript\"in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\"),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\"cf-hash\"))return t[e]}();if(t&&t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(\"data-cfemail\");if(a){for(e=\"\",r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]> */\nBitPremier received support from the NYC-based Bitcoin Opportunity Fund.

The Bitcoin Store offers hundreds of thousands of different electronics products for sale, and since the site\u2019s first beta launch in November its main attraction has been low prices; in fact, the Bitcoin Store\u2019s prices were even cheaper than those available at major retailers like Amazon and NewEgg. Roger Ver\u2019s announcement in November provided some examples: a 60-inch TV which can be found on Amazon for $1,397.99, NewEgg for $1,437.99 but on the Bitcoin Store costs only $1,367.48, a laptop whose Amazon price of $2,266.66 and NewEgg price of $2,317.00 is beaten considerably by the Bitcoin Store\u2019s price of $1985.51, and a laser printer which costs $202.01 on Amazon, $204.99 on NewEgg but $175.66 on the Bitcoin Store. Additionally, within the US, on all products above $100, shipping is always free.\nThe Bitcoin Store\u2019s low prices are made possible by Bitcoin\u2019s unique properties of no chargebacks and minimal fees; businesses accepting Bitcoin as payment can avoid paying the 2.9% credit card and Paypal fees that merchants using more traditional methods of online payment incur, and credit card chargebacks, which cost some businesses as much as 2-10% of revenue. By not accepting credit cards and Paypal at all, the Bitcoin Store passes on its savings from using Bitcoin to its customers. Also, thanks to the efforts of Bitcoin Store founder Roger Ver, the Bitcoin Store has secured a deal with wholesalers that allows the store to buy electronics at the lowest possible prices. However, the deal requires the store to maintain a high volume in order to be able to maintain these discounts \u2013 specifically, $800,000 in the next month. An audacious target, the Bitcoin Store\u2019s Jon Holmquist admits, but they hope that with the Bitcoin community\u2019s support, and with the 0% markup offer for the next month, Holmquist and Ver just might be able to achieve it. Additionally, large-scale marketing for the Bitcoin Store will finally begin, hopefully bringing in a large volume of new customers to both the store and to Bitcoin itself.\nIf the Bitcoin Store succeeds in securing enough volume to keep its discounts, it will serve as a prime example showing merchants across industry boundaries all around the world the possibilities that Bitcoin offers. Bitcoin\u2019s microtransaction, instant payment and privacy features are already well exhibited by services such as Coindl, Bitcointip, SatoshiDice and anonymous VPN provider Private Internet Access, but so far, aside from perhaps Bitcoin Wireless, there is no major business effectively showing off how Bitcoin can be used to save money on chargebacks and fees. Now, with the Bitcoin Store, there will be one. \u201cWith the big news of WordPress and Reddit accepting Bitcoin,\u201d the Bitcoin Store\u2019s press release reads, \u201ca question arises. Will the headlines soon read of Bitcoin adoption at Amazon and Newegg?\u201d", "year": 2013, "month": 2, "day": 28}

The investors include Trace Mayer, well known in the Bitcoin community for his reporting on economics and finance, as well as his privacy guide and ebook How to Vanish, Ben Davenport, co-founder of Beluga Inc and angel investor, and A-Grade Investments, a venture capital firm co-founded by Ashton Kutcher. This latest investment will bolster another round of funding made two months previously, in which private venture capital investors Barry Silbert, Shakil Khan, Jimmy Furland and Roger Ver brought a total of $510,000 into the company. BitPay has chosen not to disclose the size of this latest round, although CEO Tony Gallippi has stated that the money will be used to expand the company\u2019s hiring in Atlanta.\nThis is only the latest in a series of investments into businesses in the Bitcoin community, continuing a trend that started roughly one year ago with a $500,000 investment into Coinlab in April 2012, soon followed by $600,000 for Coinbase in September. As Ben Davenport explains, this is not a coincidence.\n\u201cBitcoin businesses,\u201d Davenport writes, \u201cuntil recently, have largely been bootstrapped. The reason is, until recently, when an angel or VC has looked at Bitcoin businesses, they saw a currency with a total market cap of about $150 million. That\u2019s too small a total addressable market to be interesting. And if an investor is savvy enough to see the potential for Bitcoin itself, then they also realize they can capture that upside without the business risk, simply by buying bitcoin. Now though, we\u2019re getting to the size where an investment in an amazing, well-positioned team like the guys at BitPay makes a lot of sense, and will also ultimately help increase the overall Bitcoin adoption rate. I predict we\u2019ll see the VC flood gates open within 12-18 months \u2014 I\u2019m just trying to be a little bit ahead of the curve there.\u201d\nLate 2012 has been a pivotal period for Bitcoin. Although the main indicator of the \u201cfinancial\u201d size of Bitcoin, the Bitcoin price, is now barely higher than it was at its peak in the beginning of June 2011, the key difference between Bitcoin\u2019s rise in price now and its bubble then is that in 2011 the Bitcoin markets\u2019 trade volume was backed almost entirely by speculation. The rise to $31.9 in June was triggered by a massive spike in public attention following a series of news articles in the mainstream media introducing many thousands of people to Bitcoin for the first time, and genuine adoption was slow to catch up. The June 2011 bubble quickly popped, but at the same time a number of Bitcoin businesses, BitPay included, began to emerge, and about one year later many of them finally started to come to fruition. In parallel, grassroots adoption of Bitcoin continued to grow, and now, slowly but surely, investors are starting to notice. Davenport\u2019s words are thus a very positive sign for Bitcoin; investors interested in Bitcoin are starting to look beyond the Bitcoin markets, and are instead increasingly focusing their eyes on the underlying Bitcoin economy \u2013 substituting mere speculation with increasing investment into the businesses that make both Bitcoin adoption and the Bitcoin price go up in the first place.\nBitPay themselves now have over 3,000 merchants, and the company is continuing to develop both their core product and a number of peripheral offerings, including plugins, applications for specific industries and a platform to help businesses and organizations pay employees in Bitcoin. The company\u2019s new office in Atlanta is located at the heart of one of the major financial capitals in the United States, allowing them to hire developers experienced in dealing with online payments, and with a larger staff the company will be able to recruit merchants as an even higher rate than they are currently.

Fulfillment by Amazon is a service which allows any business with inventory in Amazon\u2019s warehouses the ability to sell the products on their own website, and then have Amazon automatically ship them to the buyer\u2019s address. The service is available to merchants in the USA, UK, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, although it can be used to ship worldwide.\nServices like FBA are rapidly closing the gap between small businesses and large ones, giving even merchants with only a few thousand dollars of annual revenue access to world-class shipping services of the same quality as that available to major retailers. FBA merchants\u2019 customers even benefit from programs like Super Saver Shipping. Amazon also handles customer support, freeing small business owners to work on their product, and not their logistics. The program is quite expensive, but FBA users argue that without FBA they would be paying high costs on shipping and customer service anyway, and doing a poorer job at the same time.\nWhat BitPay is now offering is direct integration with the platform \u2013 that is, whenever an order is paid through BitPay, BitPay automatically notifies Amazon of the order. Thus, Bitcoin businesses no longer need to deal with Amazon integration themselves. Bitcoin Magazine itself has been using the service for weeks, and has been very satisfied. \u201cAdding BitPay\u2019s plugin to our webstore, which is based on WordPress, has dramatically improved our logistics,\u201d Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s Mihai Alisie reports. \u201cWhen orders get paid through BitPay, Amazon\u2019s servers are automatically notified, and our admin screen is updated with the correct status. PayPal does not offer the same service that BitPay can, so we have to manually process any orders which are paid through PayPal.\u201d\nPayPal may well add FBA to their offerings soon, but what this shows is that Bitcoin businesses like BitPay are now advanced enough to be competitive with their non-Bitcoin offerings. BitPay is not the first business to have come this far; Bitcoin precious metals seller Coinabul has been known industry-wide for months for its speed and reliability. \u201cConventional gold dealers are terrible at building websites,\u201d Coinabul\u2019s Jon Holmquist explains. The Bitcoin community\u2019s technical skill has proven to be a very valuable asset, and for both Coinabul and BitPay it appears to be paying off. Thanks to its latest two rounds of venture capital funding, BitPay has been able to considerably expand its staff, and will be expanding its range of offerings quickly in the months to come. For now, this is yet another small step toward making Bitcoin possibly even the preferred payment method for e-commerce businesses to start accepting payment.", "year": 2013, "month": 3, "day": 6}
{"title": "Bitcoin Price Breaks All Time High", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-price-breaks-all-time-high/", "birthday": "Feb 28, 2013  2:10 AM EST", "date": "2013-02-28 07:10:00", "content": "The Bitcoin price has just broken the all-time high of $31.9099 that it set on June 9, 2011 on MtGox. After a persistent, one-and-a-half month rally from $13 to $28, followed by nearly two weeks of bumping up against $30 and then hovering around the $28-$31.5 range, the bulls have finally won, and the currency struck a new high of $31.94 at 14:40 GMT on February 27 before quickly breaking past $32. The final rise was precipitated by a single buy order of over $100,000 USD, quickly reversing a temporary drop from $31.5 to $30.9 and leading to the price bumping against $31.89 for half an hour before finally breaking through.\nThe event is a historic one for Bitcoin. When the initial Bitcoin bubble of summer 2011 collapsed, a number of media sources quickly spread the message that Bitcoin was a foolish crypto-anarchist dream and a fad that failed, and it was time to move on to more \u201clegitimate\u201d products backed by the full support of the banking establishment. Forbes\u2019 Tim Worstall wrote as early as late June that \u201cthat\u2019s the end of Bitcoin, then\u201d Technology writer Timothy B Lee (not to be confused with Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web) wrote an article on the Bitcoin crash in August, ending with the words \u201cI suspect it\u2019s terminal.\u201d Wired ran an article in November which, although not as bleak, was nevertheless entitled \u201cThe Rise And Fall of Bitcoin\u201c. Doug Casey, a celebrated libertarian precious metals guru, released a lengthy interview in which he described Bitcoin as \u201cprobably a dead duck\u201d that was bound to collapse because of its lack of physical backing, and offered GoldMoney as an alternative.\nAfter hitting bottom at $1.994 in November, however, Bitcoin simply refused to die. The price bounced back to a high of $7.22 in January 2012 before settling down at $4.90, and news slowly began to once again turn positive. In January Bitcoin was featured in an episode of The Good Wife, and in April Reuters came out with an article entitled \u201cBitcoin, the City Trader\u2019s Anarchic New Toy\u201d. In June came a number of further articles, although the collapse of Bitcoin Savings and Trust and the shutdown of the Global Bitcoin Stock Exchange led to a new period of pessimism in the fall. However, that period turned out to be a brief one, as the announcement of WordPress accepting Bitcoin in early November broke the downward trend, and Bitcoin Central\u2019s banking partnership deal in December cemented the new paradigm. Finally, in January Bitcoin truly started to take off. A series of positive announcements, including unprecendented profits by Bitcoin gambling site SatoshiDice, large-scale underlying adoption and the arrival of ASIC mining hardware chips, sent the price on a sudden course upward, and in February Reddit and Mega accepting Bitcoin cemented the new paradigm.\nWhat happened? The answer is simple: the Gartner Hype Cycle. In 1995, the IT research firm Gartner noticed that many new technologies tend to follow a specific five-stage patten in their adoption: (1) the initial technology trigger, (2) a \u201cpeak of inflated expectations\u201d as people get excited about all of the possibilities that the new technology could potentially offer, (3) a \u201ctrough of disillusionment\u201d as the technology fails to live up to its original expectations and its more fickle supporters abandon it to move on to the next great idea, (4) a \u201cslope of enlightenment\u201d as the community realizes that the trough of disillusionment was just as overblown as the initial peak, and (5) a \u201cplateau of productivity\u201d where people discover what the uses are where the technology can truly shine and apply it to maximum benefit. The graph of the Hype Cycle, as shown by Wikipedia, looks like this:\nLooking at Bitcoin\u2019s price between March 2011 and December 2012, one can see an almost perfect overlap with\u00a0the cycle, albeit with a slower, two-stage slope of enlightenment.\u00a0\nNow, however, Bitcoin is rising for a second time, and it is quite possible that a new hype cycle will begin as Bitcoin truly breaks into the mainstream, and new groups of more professional speculators and investors seize upon the currency as a stock.\nFor those who dismissed Bitcoin as a pump-and-dump, a fad or a quack, now is the time to repent. Timothy B Lee already has, and we in the cryptocurrency community gladly welcome him. To Doug Casey, Tim Worstall and the others who have disparaged Bitcoin in the past, this moment is as good a time as any to re-evaluate your opinions. As for the future, at this point Bitcoin is a wild card. The original major bubble in April 2011 started when Bitcoin broke past its previous February high of $1.12; now that Bitcoin has broken past $32 it can go anywhere. Some have predicted $45; others $100, and still others believe that the bubble is only starting, and we may see a meteoric as great in magnitude as the one in 2011 \u2013 that is, by June 2013 we will hit $1000. Unlikely, perhaps, but in April 2011 no one was predicting $30. On the other hand, the price may well simply continue its current linear trend, or even stabilize or drop. Regardless of what happens, according to almost every single indicator (with Google Trends volume being the exception) Bitcoin is far stronger now than it was in 2011, and is poised to only get stronger. Now is the time for Bitcoin to truly shine.", "year": 2013, "month": 2, "day": 28}
{"title": "WalletBit Team Comes Out With New and Improved Platform BIPS", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/walletbit-team-comes-out-with-new-and-improved-platform-bips-1362777436/", "birthday": "Mar 8, 2013  4:17 PM EST", "date": "2013-03-08 21:17:00", "content": "Adam Harding and Kris Henriksen, the two people currently in charge of the popular Bitcoin payment processing platform WalletBit, have come up with a new and improved merchant platform: BIPS. BIPS brings a number of improvements over WalletBit including a new user interface, an easy-to-use REST API for interacting with the service automatically and, most importantly, no fees for the basic Bitcoin service. Instead, BIPS will make its money on a variety of complementary services, including user-encrypted cold storage, having fees automatically deposited to one\u2019s bank account, and having one\u2019s funds automatically converted to USD on MtGox to insure against sudden drops in the Bitcoin price.\nBIPS is not the first service to make such an offer; basic Bitcoin payment processing with MtGox or Coinbase has been free for months, and using MtGox directly will be cheaper than doing so through BIPS and paying its 0.89% fee. BIPS will be cheaper than BitPay for merchants [NOTE: On 25 March 2013 BitPay lowered their fees to 0.99% for both processing bitcoins and if the funds are converted into fiat currencies] converting to fiat currency, with a conversion fee of 2.50% internationally (although not cheaper than Coinbase\u2019s 1% in the US), but for merchants who intend to receive Bitcoin directly it may be difficult to see why merchants should use BIPS instead of Coinbase or MtGox. But where BIPS intends to make up for the costs that it does have is ease of use. Its API services are very easy to work with; BIPS shows on their front page how to construct a URL to create an invoice, and in the merchant section it features a simple form in which you enter a callback URL and an optional \u201csecret\u201d parameter, and any payments that a customer makes will automatically lead to a notification being sent to the URL. Actually handling callback URLs and knowing when to make invoices is still the responsibility of the merchant, but BIPS makes the merchant integration side as easy as possible. More features will soon be added, including API calls to send money to a Bitcoin address, phone or email address, and aside from the planned API upgrades there will also soon be options like exporting transactions to an Excel spreadsheet. Like WalletBit, BIPS also provides an e-wallet, and there too it intends to make the experience as easy as possible. Users can sign in using Google, Twitter or Facebook and be logged into their wallet already as they browse the internet. For merchants, BIPS has a mobile checkout application available already. \u201cWe hope to provide the best checkout experience for customers using bitcoin to pay,\u201d Henriksen writes, \u201cand the best experience for merchant as a merchant bitcoin gateway.\u201d\nBIPS brings the same level of security as WalletBit, and in many cases even greater. Multifactor authentication is available in the form of Google Authenticator and WalletBit\u2019s SecureCard, a matrix of letters and numbers that can be printed out on a piece of paper that the login process asks for a specific cell from. On Monday, BIPS will also add IP guard, limiting account access to specific IP addresses. On the server side, BIPS will store the majority of merchants\u2019 funds in cold storage, backing it up to over a dozen hard drives running RAID 6 as well as archival tape, and the rest on a hot wallet to handle withdrawals. The exact percentage of funds placed into cold storage is based on an algorithm first used at WalletBit, which attempts to predict how much money merchants are likely to withdraw. Currently, Henriksen is unable to give an exact number for the percentage of merchants\u2019 bitcoins that will be placed in cold storage, although the more merchants BIPS can sign up the closer to 100% this value will be. There is also another option of 100% user-encrypted cold storage, at a cost of 0.89%, in which you supply a password with which your wallet is encrypted client-side, and then stored by BIPS in the same cold-storage facility as that used by regular cold storage with the added protection that even they cannot access your funds. Starting Monday, merchants will also be able to have your merchant revenue sent directly to this cold storage.\nWalletBit is not disappearing; the old service is still available at walletbit.com for those who want to use it. However, for new merchants there is no reason to use it instead of BIPS and Henriksen hopes that users will see the benefit in switching to BIPS. WalletBit\u2019s eWallet, however, will soon be removed, although it will not be missed by many; the 0.89% fee on the wallet unfortunately turned most potential users away. BIPS\u2019s wallet service is free, so it will hopefully find much more usage. BIPS already has several merchants in the works, and further announcements from BIPS on the topic are soon to come.", "year": 2013, "month": 3, "day": 8}
{"title": "Bitcoin\u2019s Security Coming of Age", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoins-security-coming-of-age-1363056333/", "birthday": "Mar 11, 2013  10:45 PM EST", "date": "2013-03-12 03:45:00", "content": "One of the greatest technical challenges in working with Bitcoin has always been finding an effective way to secure it. Although financial security is a serious and complex issue regardless of the underlying financial system that is being used, warranting billions of dollars of spending on the part of major banks every year, in the case of Bitcoin the scale is tipped in favor of the attacker even more than it normally is. There are two key factors that contribute to this: irreversibility and anonymity. Irreversibility means that transactions, once completed, cannot be reversed, so if a Bitcoin exchange is hacked there is no way to force the money back automatically as might be possible under a centrally controlled banking system. Anonymity means that there is no way to tell who or where the thief is physically through the financial system, leaving investigators with very little evidence to work with (although on one prominent occasion a $310,000 thief was caught through other means). Although Bitcoin is technically far more secure than most other financial systems available, in practice its digitally slippery nature means that even the tiniest security flaw in implementation is magnified greatly, and so it is only with services that are quite secure by themselves do Bitcoin\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s advantages truly shine through And, over the past two years, we have seen a number of very painful reminders that we are simply not there yet. A list of top 20 Bitcoin heists exists on the Bitcointalk forums, showing a number of incidents in which tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars were suddenly whisked away, leaving entire companies nearly, or totally, bankrupt in an instant.\nEven more so than black market activity, such security breaches have arguably been the largest stain on Bitcoin\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s reputation. A MtGox hack in June 2011, in which the currency\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s price appeared to drop from $17.50 to $0.01 within a day (although it is highly misleading to say that it actually did drop to $0.01), is one of the most often cited incidents by journalists attacking Bitcoin, and for many the various security incidents of 2012 have only strengthened the negative impression originally set by the series of security breaches\nIn the past two weeks, however, three incidents took place which provide a convincing argument that we are well on the way to getting there. The first is, perhaps counterintuitively, another theft. On March 4, BitInstant announced that an unknown intruder had gained access to their VirWox account and made a series of withdrawals to three unknown addresses, presumably their own. The total amount lost: $12,480. Not $1.1 million, like the MyBitcoin scam of 2012, not $90,000 to $310,000 like the four major 2012 thefts from Bitcoinica and BitFloor, and not even the $15,000 that was the size of the February 2012 Bitcoinica theft that almost no one has even heard of, but simply $12,000 - only a rounding error for a corporation of BitInstant\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s size. But it wasn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t just the fact that the incident was small that is surprising, but rather what the attacker did to get the money.\nBitInstant writes on their blog:\n The attacker contacted our domain registrar at Site5 posing as me and using a very similar email address as mine, they did so by proxying through a network owned by a haulage company in the UK whom I suspect are innocent victims the same as ourselves. Armed with knowledge of my place of birth and mother\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s maiden name alone (both facts easy to locate on the public record) they convinced Site5 staff to add their email address to the account and make it the primary login (this prevented us from deleting it from the account). We immediately realized what was going on, and logged in to change the information back. After changing this info and locking the attacker out, overnight he was able to revert my changes and point our website somewhere else. Site5 is denying any damages, but we suspect this was partly their fault. After gaining access, they redirected DNS by pointing the nameservers to hetzner.de in germany, they used hetzner\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s nameservers to redirect traffic to a hosting provider in ukraine. By doing this, he locked out both my login and Gareths\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s login and they used this to hijack our emails and reset the login for one exchange (VirWox), enabling them to gain access and steal $12,480 USD worth of BTC. No other exchanges were affected due to either Mult Factor Authentication, OTP, Yubikey\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s and auto lockdowns. \nBitInstant have since learned their lesson, and are now using multifactor authentication for their VirWoX account as well.\nNow, compare what it took to steal $310,000 from Bitcoinica last July:\n Unbeknownst to us, Tihan was using the mtgox api key as the password for a website called LastPass ... Whoever is responsible for the latest theft used the MtGox API key as a password in LastPass hoping that simple security measures were not followed in the setting up of the LastPass. They gained access to MtGox. They transferred a third of the refund money, presumably to themselves.\nThe MtGox API key was made public in a source code leak a few days before the hack, an enterprising digital hacker decided to try the key as a password on LastPass, and, voil\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\xc3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\x83\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\xc2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\xa0, the thief earned himself a small fortune. In the case of BitInstant, on the other hand, it took a complex procedure including a form of domain spoofing and social engineering to get anywhere, and the profits were over twenty times smaller. The flaws that the attacker used were not unique to Bitcoin; these are attacks that can be used against businesses no matter what industry they happen to be in, and in the case of social engineering even those that have nothing to do with the internet are not secure. If BitInstant\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s defenses after this hack represent anything less than top-notch security, then it is safe to say that pretty much no one is secure.\nThe second development in Bitcoin security comes from Exante\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s recently announced Bitcoin Fund, a Malta-based hedge fund that intends to open the door for institutional investors to enter the Bitcoin markets. The fund will also be the first professionally developed way for investors to trade bitcoins on margin, long and short, and the shorting functionality in particular may turn out to be a significant boon for Bitcoin\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s stability.\nBut the maintennance of such a fund poses a significant security challenge. Exante is in possession of $3 million worth of bitcoins, and if the bitcoins are lost or stolen the fund will have no choice but to shut down in an instant. Exante, however, has risen up to the challenge, and the security measures that they describe are impressive. First of all, the private keys themselves, stored in a BitcoinQt wallet.dat, are encrypted with AES256. The data is then stored in a TrueCrypt container on three flash drives. The container password is then split into three parts using a mechanism known as Shamir\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Secret Sharing. The way basic 2-of-3 sharing works is this: suppose you are trying to hide a secret value, x. Pick a random y, on about the same scale as x. Write down three numbers in three separate places: x-y, y and x+y. Obviously, no single piece by itself will help you find x. However, if you have any two of them, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s very easy to combine them in order to get x back, either directly by adding or subtracting y or indirectly by taking (x-y)+(x+y)=2x and then dividing by 2 to find x. Shamir\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Secret Sharing is a clever mathematical generalization of this; for example, you can \"split\" a number into 15 pieces such that any 9 of them (but no 8 of them) are enough to get the original number back. This provides security against theft and redundancy of loss at the same time. Strictly speaking, SSS is unnecessary; multisignature transactions accomplish the same thing using the scripting power of the Bitcoin protocol directly. However, it is effective, and is used to store critical data like root SSL certificate authority private keys, which can cause millions of dollars of damage if leaked. Finally, each flash drive is duplicated several times and the pieces are stored in three separate jurisdictions.\nThis is the security setup that the team at Exante has deemed strong enough to store millions of dollars of bitcoins securely. This is the gold standard that all major Bitcoin businesses that handle such large quantities of customer funds can aspire to, and it provides a level of security comparable to that used to store data or physical objects tens or even hundreds of times greater in value. Most businesses will, of course, not need nearly so much protection; this level of security is reserved for high-level financial services, but what is important is that, for the first time, a group of professional, internationally trusted and established hedge fund managers has decided that Bitcoin can be made secure enough to be taken seriously.\nBIPS tape archival unit\nFinally, we also have another development in Bitcoin security, this time coming from within the existing Bitcoin community: BIPS. The new merchant platform from WalletBit includes a number of upgrades, including significant improvements in usability and, in some cases, lower fees than BitPay, but where BIPS truly stands out is in its security. Like all other major merchant services and exchanges, BIPS keeps most of its funds in cold storage. Its cold storage platform, however, is one of the most advanced that have ever been implemented for use with BTC. BIPS\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' Kris Henriksen writes, \"without revealing to much of our infrastructure, we backup to 1 SAN (12 WD Red harddrives), 2 NAS (5 WD RED drives) all running raid 6, and then from there to the robotic tape library\", and director of marketing Adam Harding adds \"BIPS follows the same security practices as WalletBit and even more so. This includes regular tape backups of every server stored in a fire proof faraday cage under lock and key. This is the same feature we offer for our cold storage with an additional password only the user knows but in the event of a global EMP, the bitcoind is backed up every hour.\" Tape backups are a method of data archival that, Harding adds, \"is the most reliable backup method out there and still used by every major organization.\" The tapes themselves are stored in a datacenter in Denmark, although the hard drive backups ensure that there is no single point of failure against loss. BIPS\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' security scheme is not quite as impressive as that created by Exante; a form of secret sharing is technically used in the RAID 6 implementation, but multi-jurisdiction or even multi-location storage is not yet something that BIPS have implemented. However, for the tiny startup that BIPS is, the setup is quite impressive.\nWhat all of this shows is that Bitcoin security is now being taken very seriously, and established Bitcoin businesses have developed comprehensive security policies and physical systems that are proving increasingly effective against attack. There are still details to be ironed out; two months ago, another Bitcoin exchange lost its funds primarily due to a disappeared shareholder with sole access to the cold storage USB, and mechanisms for Bitcoin exchanges to demonstrate solvency and possession of full reserves to their customers are another improvement that may be needed in the future. However, what Bitcoin users, detractors and journalists need to realize is that we are no longer living in 2011 or 2012. Most of the businesses that were insecure have now been weeded out by natural selection and, as for those that remain, the greater attention to Bitcoin paid by established players like Exante and the Silicon Valley investors in Coinbase and BitPay is ensuring that services run by trustworthy individuals with established reputations on the line are available. Over the course of this past year, although the size of the Bitcoin economy has grown by a factor of ten the total volume of hacks and thefts has actually considerably gone down. Although security will never be a solved problem either in the world of Bitcoin or anywhere else, the crippling hurdle that turned so many away from Bitcoin in 2011 and 2012 is now well past us.", "year": 2013, "month": 3, "day": 12}
{"title": "FINCEN: Bitcoin Users Not Regulated, Exchanges Are", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/fincen-bitcoin-users-not-regulated-exchanges-are/", "birthday": "Mar 19, 2013  2:49 AM EST", "date": "2013-03-19 07:49:00", "content": "Government regulation has for a long time been a gray area for Bitcoin, both in the United States and elsewhere. Although we have seen a number of disparate government reports either simply talking about Bitcoin or providing a regulatory opinion on some aspect of Bitcoin exchange, to date we have not seen anything close to a conclusive statement on digital currencies from any government organization in any country in the world. The problem is a difficult one; nearly all laws to date that attempted to regulate online payments of any form have all assumed a central issuer, and in the case of Bitcoin it could be just as easily argued that everyone is an issuer or that no one is. Today, however, we have gained a much clearer picture of what regulation for Bitcoin will look like, as FINCEN just released a paper clarifying their position on virtual currencies, touching on the concept of \u201cdecentralized digital currency\u201d in detail with Bitcoin clearly in mind.\nThe paper starts off delineating a clear definition of what virtual currency is: \u201cFinCEN\u2019s regulations define currency (also referred to as \u201creal\u201d currency) as \u201cthe coin and paper money of the United States or of any other country that [i] is designated as legal tender and that [ii] circulates and [iii] is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance. \u201d In contrast to real currency, \u201cvirtual\u201d currency is a medium of exchange that operates like a currency in some environments, but does not have all the attributes of real currency. In particular, virtual currency does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction.\u201d It then breaks digital currencies down into three forms: e-currencies and e-precious metals, centralized digital currencies and decentralized digital currencies. Although the document does not explicity define an e-currency and what differentiates it from any other virtual currency, a footnote makes the likely intended meaning clear: \u201cTypically, this involves the broker or dealer electronically distributing digital certificates of ownership of real currencies or precious metals, with the digital certificate being the virtual currency.\u201d That is, e-currencies are essentially certificates for what FINCEN calls \u201creal\u201d currencies \u2013 that is, currencies that are, somewhere in the world, legal tender. Centralized virtual currencies are digital currencies that have a \u201ccentralized repository\u201d; this is likely intended as a catch-all term for any virtual currencies which are not simply tokens for \u201creal\u201d currency or precious metals but rather a currency in their own right, Second Life\u2019s Linden dollars is perhaps the existing canonical example, although a hypothetical Bitcoin-like unbacked currency backed by a central repository would also fall into the scope. Finally, there are decentralized digital currencies. A decentralized digital currency is one \u201c(1) that has no central repository and no single administrator , and (2) that persons may obtain by their own computing or manufacturing effort\u201d \u2013 Bitcoin being right in the crosshairs. Interestingly, Ripple fits one half of the definition but not the other \u2013 although Ripple itself is decentralized, or at least will be once the server is released, all 100 billion XRP that will ever exist have already been created. If Ripple succeeds, perhaps FINCEN will be forced to release yet another clarifying guidance paper in two years\u2019 time.\nThe paper also describes three roles that virtual currency users can have: user, exchanger and administrator. The concept of administrator is very narrow; the document states: \u201cAn administrator is a person engaged as a business in issuing (putting into circulation) a virtual currency , and who has the authority to redeem (to withdraw from circulation) such virtual currency\u201d \u2013 the latter condition specifically excluding anyone in the Bitcoin economy, as Bitcoin has no concept of redeeming bitcoins in any meaningful way; even transaction fees are instantly transferred over to a miner in the next block. The definition of exchangers is simple: \u201cAn exchanger is a person engaged as a business in the exchange of virtual currency for real currency, funds, or other virtual currency.\u201d Finally, a user is simply someone who uses virtual currencies to buy and sell goods and services.\nThe major boon from the document for Bitcoin is this: users get off lightly. In fact, FINCEN does not intend to touch mere users of virtual currency at all; the document states, \u201ca user who obtains convertible virtual currency and uses it to purchase real or virtual goods or services is not an MSB under FinCEN\u2019s regulations. Such activity, in and of itself, does not fit within the definition of \u201cmoney transmission services\u201d and therefore is not subject to FinCEN\u2019s registration, reporting, and recordkeeping regulations for MSBs.\u201d The document also offers protection from \u201cprepaid access\u201d laws that regulate gift cards and the like, saying that \u201ca person\u2019s acceptance and/or transmission of convertible virtual currency cannot be characterized as providing or selling prepaid access because prepaid access is limited to real currencies.\u201d Finally, even exchanges are safe from \u201cforeign exchange\u201d regulation, the set of rules governing businesses that offer exchange between two or more national currencies.\nThe document continues:\nA person that creates units of this convertible virtual currency and uses it to purchase real or virtual goods and services is a user of the convertible virtual currency and not subject to regulation as a money transmitter. By contrast, a person that creates units of convertible virtual currency and sells those units to another person for real currency or its equivalent is engaged in transmission to another location and is a money transmitter. In addition, a person is an exchanger and a money transmitter if the person accepts such de \u2013 centralized convertible virtual currency from one person and transmits it to another person as part of the acceptance and transfer of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency.\nThe first two sentences clearly have to do with miners. What they state is simple: miners that use their bitcoins to buy goods and services are not regulated. However, miners that sell their bitcoins are. That is to say, interpreting these words literally, miners have to register as money transmitters if they are selling their bitcoins. But there is also another interpretation, hinging on the phrase \u201cto another person\u201d. Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik writes on Reddit, In my non-legal opinion, it seems like miners are ok if they (a) exchange for fiat via a licensed bitcoin exchange, or (b) buy goods and services for bitcoins, staying inside the bitcoin economy. That is, \u201cto another person\u201d may simply refer to selling bitcoins over the counter directly, and if they are selling through a licensed Bitcoin exchange then that Bitcoin exchange\u2019s license carries over to both sides of the transaction. But even if the first interpretation is the one FINCEN intends, it is trivial to bypass; miners can simply spend their earnings instead, using Bitspend to purchase goods in the USD economy with Bitcoin if the Bitcoin economy proper does not satisfy their needs.\nThe last sentence, however, is quite troubling. Although seemingly tautological, the sentence includes two key words: \u201cmoney transmitter\u201d. Money transmitter is in fact a technical term used by FINCEN that has a very specific regulatory meaning \u2013 a money transmitter needs to get a money transmitted license. These licenses require tens of thousands dollars of capital to acquire in each state, and a money transmitter must get a license in each state whose residents they intend to provide services to; all in all, a very serious roadblock to the United States\u2019 big four exchanges: BitInstant, Coinlab, Coinbase and now Tradehill. The recent Bitcoin ATM project may also fall under the radar. So far, it is not clear what the owners of these services intend to do, and the rate of Bitcoin\u2019s growth in the United States in the months to come will very significantly depend on just how both the exchanges and FINCEN itself will proceed.\nFortunately, payment processors such as BitPay are exempt. BitPay is legally classified as a payment processor, not a money transmitter. Gallippi points to 31 CFR \u00a7 1010.100(ff)(5)(ii)(A)\u2013F, a set of FINCEN rules which clarify that \u201cthe term money transmitter does not include a person who only \u2026 (ii) Acts as a payment processor to facilitate the purchase of, or payment of a bill for, a good or service through a clearance and settlement system by agreement with the creditor or seller.\u201d Becuase BitPay deals financially only with sellers, CEO Tony Gallippi explains, and not with customers, BitPay is in the clear.\nAlthough the requirement for exchanges to get a money transmitter license is highly problematic, for the most part this guidance paper is a positive sign for Bitcoin for one simple reason: Bitcoin itself is now unambiguously legal, and that will not change any time soon. Even though the document does place Bitcoin exchanges under a very significant burden of regulation, what it also means is that nothing worse is going to come. Many organizations, including the popular independent video game collection Humble Indie Bundle, have been hesitant to accept Bitcoin over legal uncertainty, but now that the matter is settled they have no reason to fear; as long as they are not acting as money transmitters for BTC as well, under the new rules they are now fully protected. Although the document does not specifically mention the act of paying salaries in Bitcoin, the words that are there strongly imply that that is nothing more than mere usage as well. On the whole, FINCEN has just cleared the way for previously hesitant businesses and organizations to start experimenting with Bitcoin on a much larger scale.", "year": 2013, "month": 3, "day": 19}
{"title": "Bitcoin Network Shaken by Blockchain Fork", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-network-shaken-by-blockchain-fork-1363144448/", "birthday": "Mar 12, 2013  11:14 PM EST", "date": "2013-03-13 04:14:00", "content": "Yesterday, the Bitcoin network experienced one of the most serious hiccups that we have seen in the past four years. Starting from block 225430, the blockchain literally split into two, with one half of the network adding blocks to one version of the chain, and the other half adding to the other. For the next six hours, there were effectively two Bitcoin networks operating at the same time, each with its own version of the transaction history. The split lasted for 24 blocks or 6 hours, finally resolving itself when one version of the chain conclusively pulled ahead of the other at block 225454, leaving the other chain largely abandoned, with only a small number of miners that are incapable of recognizing what has now become the main chain still mining it, while the bulk of the network quickly returned to normal.\nThe fork was first noticed at about 23:30 GMT on Monday, March 11, when \u201cthermoman\u201d on the bitcoin-dev IRC channel mentioned that \u201csome client told my client it (the other host) had 225431 blocks, but blockexplorer says that currently the block count is at 225430\u2033. Some other blockchain resources also showed 225430 blocks. Over the course of the next thirty minutes, other users started reporting more strange reports from Bitcoin client logs. Bitcoin developer Peter Wuille (\u201csipa\u201d on IRC) claimed that he was on block 225435, and then soon 225439, while other sources were still reporting 225431. At 00:00 GMT March 12, sipa posted \u201cI wonder if there\u2019s something that triggered it on the network, a large reorganization or so\u201d. It turned out that a blockchain reorganization, an event that happens when a client discovers a new blockchain longer (and therefore more likely to be valid) than the one it was working with before, and switches to it, was indeed what happened, and over the next few minutes everyone realized what was going on: a blockchain fork.\nWhat had happened was the following. The latest version 0.8 release of bitcoind, by far the most popular implementation of Bitcoin used by miners, switched the database that it used to store blocks and transactions from BerkeleyDB to the more efficient LevelDB as part of an effort to reduce blockchain synchronization time. However, what the developers did not realize at the time was that by doing so they also accidentally introduced a change to the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. In order to make an update to the database, the database process must make a \u201clock\u201d on the part of the database which stores that particular item of information, a mechanism implemented to prevent two changes from occurring simultaneously and accidentally corrupting the database. In a b-tree, the data structure used by BerkeleyDB to store objects, two locks are required per update. However, BerkeleyDB requires its users to set a limit to the number of locks that can be made at the same time; \u201cIf the values are too small,\u201d the FAQ page warns, \u201crequests for locks in an application will fail. If the values are too large, the locking subsystem will consume more resources than is necessary.\u201d In the case of Bitcoin, the limit was 10,000. What happened in block 225430 was that a single block simultaneously affected the status of over 5,000 transactions, requiring more than 10,000 locks on the b-tree to be made at the same time. As a result, the BerkeleyDB failed, and so the older bitcoind 0.7 (and earlier versions) could not read the block. In the case of bitcoind 0.8, LevelDB has no such restrictions, so it could accept such blocks just fine. Because the Bitcoin protocol builds up the transaction history, used primarily to calculate and agree on everyone\u2019s account balances, by creating new blocks representing roughly ten-minute time intervals\u2019 worth of transactions on top of existing valid blocks in a chain (hence, \u201cblockchain\u201d), miners using bitcoind 0.8 started building up a version of the blockchain that included the offending block, while miners using bitcoind 0.7 rejected it and started working on a another blockchain of their own. Ordinary users using BitcoinQt 0.7 or platforms that rely on bitcoind 0.7 as a server saw the 0.7 fork, and everyone else saw the 0.8 fork.\nWith the fork in progress, the Bitcoin developers had a choice: do they support the 0.8 fork or the 0.7 fork? Ultimately, there could only be one; a monetary system cannot function if there are two different databases of how much money each person has. The 0.8 fork had much more computing power behind it, and was already eight blocks ahead by the time the community could muster any effort toward fixing the problem, and upgrading to 0.8 is something that will have to be done eventually. On the other hand, if the 0.8 fork took over, thousands of users on 0.7 would be forced to upgrade in order to use Bitcoin at all, something which would not happen if the 0.7 fork took over since both versions of bitcoind can read it. The developers quickly settled on 0.7, and the community set to work on the next task: notifying major miners and mining pool operators of what they need to do.\nOver the next few hours, nearly every major Bitcoin developer and mining pool operator joined the bitcoin-dev IRC channel. Major mining pools that were using bitcoind 0.8 shut down, downgraded to 0.7, and switched back on. Merchants were also notified; most large businesses, including BitcoinStore, BitPay, SatoshiDice and MtGox, shut down deposits to protect themselves from double spend attacks. BitPay quickly turned themselves back on once their servers were on the 0.7 fork; \u201csafe mode alerted us there\u2019s a problem,\u201d BitPay\u2019s Tony Gallippi writes. \u201cThat\u2019s when Steve jumped on IRC to see where the consensus was going, and we were back in business very quickly.\u201d Progress on switching hash power to 0.8 appeared to be slow at first, and at block 225451, the 0.8 chain was 13 blocks longer than 0.7. But that was the furthest that the 0.8 chain would get ahead. By then, the two chains were growing roughly in lockstep, and at about 03:30 the tipping point came. The 0.7 chain quickly caught up to being only 10 blocks behind, then 8 blocks, and at 06:19 both chains converged to the same length at block 225454, leading to nearly all remaining miners abandoning the other.\nThis incident will go down in history as one of the closest moments that we have come to the underlying Bitcoin protocol actually failing. But it is not the most serious breach ever made. In August 2010, a transaction in block 74638 contained two outputs summing to over 184 billion \u2013 just over 2^64 satoshis. The result was an integer overflow bug, the digital equivalent of a mechanical odometer wrapping around to zero after the car drives 999,999 kilometers. The overflow caused the software to think that the transaction contained only a small amount of BTC while in reality the outputs together had thousands of times more than the 21 million that should ever exist. A new version of the Bitcoin software had to be published, the blockchain was forked, and a new, valid, chain overtook the old one at block 74691 \u2013 53 blocks after the original fork. This time, it only took 24 blocks, and it was not even a life-critical threat to the system \u2013 if the developers had done nothing, then Bitcoin would have carried on nonetheless, only causing inconvenience to those bitcoind and BitcoinQt users who were on 0.7 and would have had to upgrade. The economic damage was significant, but fairly small; the only monetary losses that have been reported are the $26,000 USD worth of mining block rewards from the 24 mined blocks of 25 BTC that are now forever lost in the now abandoned chain, as well as a $10,000 double spend against OKPay. Aside from the lost mining revenue and this double spend, transactions were not affected and no bitcoins were \u201clost\u201d; any transaction that was included in the now abandoneded chain was included in the new chain as well, so any bitcoins that were spent during the fork are now at their proper destinations.\nIn a way, this was the best possible time for such a thing to happen. The Bitcoin price was on a steady uptrend, and so the 24% drop in price that occurred at the time of the incident was quickly reversed, and as of the time of this writing Bitcoin stands at $44-$46, down from $48 the day earlier but up from $36 one week before. Public media attention on Bitcoin is very much positive, and rather than attacking Bitcoin as they would have in 2011 many journalists actually praised the Bitcoin development team on their rapid response. Ars Technica\u2019s Timothy B Lee wrote a neutral piece on the event, writing that \u201cthe incident will be an important test of the cryptocurrency\u2019s decentralized governance structure\u201d, and an article at ecurrency.ec on the subject was entitled \u201cBitcoin software bug has been rapidly resolved\u201d.\nHowever, the incident opens up serious questions about the nature of the Bitcoin protocol, and puts into the spotlight some uncomfortable facts about Bitcoin\u2019s notion of \u201cdecentralization\u201d. Most security protocols, including encryption algorithms, hash algorithms and full-scale protocols, have dozens of implementations in many different programming languages, and the protocol specification is determined by a clear standard against which any individual implementation can be checked for compliance. In the case of Bitcoin, however, things are different. Although there is technically a standard on the Bitcoin wiki pages, it has at times been poorly updates, and the reality is that the bitcoind implementation is the standard, and nearly all miners on the Bitcoin network are using some version of it. There are a few alternative implementations, the most complete one being Amir Taaki\u2019s libbitcoin, with Mike Hearn\u2019s BitcoinJ (written in Java) close behind, but so far they have gained very little traction in use with mining, and, what\u2019s more, there is a small portion of the Bitcoin development community which is actively against the idea of using multiple codebases.\nFortunately, most Bitcoin developers do not support this viewpoint, although many have come out in favor of keeping a healthy level of prudence. Mike Hearn wrote the following on the Bitcointalk forums in June 2011:\nGavin wrote to me only days after the BitCoinJ release to tell me how happy he was to see an alternative implementation. Satoshi expressed very similar sentiments. Nobody is against alternative implementations. What some people, especially Satoshi, have said is that there\u2019s an unusual amount of risk involved with reimplementing the full system and using that reimplementation to mine. Bitcoin is very complex and if you aren\u2019t skilled and very thorough you are likely to diverge from its behavior in small, hard to detect ways. This can fork the chain and split the economy. It\u2019s one of the few things that could instantly kill Bitcoin beyond legal harassment of its users.\nLead Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen replied to another poster in the same thread: \u201cReally? I\u2019ve been encouraging alternative implementations, who is the power-hungry core developer?\u201d, and in November 2012 he wrote in a Bitcoin Foundation update that \u201cpart of the solution is to encourage alternative implementations that make different trust/convenience tradeoffs than the reference implementation. There has been a lot of behind-the-scenes work on cross-implementation testing (the \u201ctestnet3\u2033 blockchain contains hundreds of transaction validation test cases, for example), and new features are being added to the protocol to support alternative implementations\u201d\nBut alternative implementations are not just useful for supporting different trust/convenience tradeoffs. They are also crucial in making Bitcoin\u2019s claim of decentralization a reality. If there had instead been five distinct Bitcoin implementation in use at the time of the fork, what would have happened is that one of the five would have recognized the wrong blockchain and forked off, leading to a loss of revenue for a small number of miners and requiring the users of clients using that implementation to upgrade. The aberrant implementation\u2019s fork of the blockchain would end up much weaker than the others right from the start, so the risk of double spend attacks would be minimal. One can argue that there will be a greater number of forking incidents with more implementations, but each one will be smaller in effect, and testing all implementations together on the testnet before release would reduce the number of bugs that slip into production software to about the same frequency as we see today.\nThe other aspect of Bitcoin\u2019s decentralization that this incident calls into question is that of mining pools. The reason why the controlled switch to the 0.7 fork was even possible was that over 70% of the Bitcoin network\u2019s hash power was controlled by a small number of mining pools and ASIC miners, and so the miners could all be individually contacted and convinced to immediately downgrade. Another article on the fork reads [Russian]: \u201cthe real problem is not even in the code supporting the Bitcoin network; bugs are everywhere. Rather, it\u2019s the matter of who controls it. This event clearly showed that even such a well thought-out system is controlled by the will of a very small number of people \u2013 particularly, the operators of mining pools. Over 70% of new blocks right now are being found on pools, and not on individual solo miners. The underlying idea of the system was that the benevolent majority can stop a small number of attackers, but in the present time it is simply not working. The winner in a possible takeover will be the one with greater computing power, and no one else.\u201d Bitcoin is clearly not at all the direct democracy that many of its early adherents imagined, and, some worry, if a centralized core of the Bitcoin community is powerful enough to successfully undertake these emergency measures to set right the Bitcoin blockchain, what else is it powerful enough to do? Force double spends to reverse million-dollar thefts? Block or even redirect transactions known to originate from Silk Road? Perhaps even modify Bitcoin\u2019s sacred 21 million currency supply limit?\nHowever, a strong argument can be made that such fears are very unlikely to materialize. The reason why has nothing to do with the specific identities of the Bitcoin mining pool operators or the cohesiveness of the Bitcoin mining community; rather, it\u2019s the fact that Bitcoin mining is still in fact quite decentralized; it simply is decentralized in a different way. Taking a political analogy, the closest equivalent would be a liquid democracy: a hybrid of direct and representative democracy where people can either vote for individual bills by themselves or assign politicians \u2013 with the proviso that if they do not like what a given politician is doing they can switch to assigning their voting power to someone else at any time. Back in the world of Bitcoin, although much of the Bitcoin network\u2019s hash power is concentrated with mining pool operators in practice, every individual miner can switch from one pool to another almost instantly, so if a coalition of mining pool operators decides to start violating the Bitcoin protocol miners can simply switch to any pool that remains honest, instantly depriving the miscreants of their power. Although no mining pool has attempted to actively subvert the Bitcoin protocol so far, this kind of \u201cvoting\u201d has been done before; in 2011, there were several incidents where the mining pool Deepbit pushed above 50% of the total network hash power, and in each case there was a mass exodus of miners toward other pools to balance things out. Although the nominal power may rest with the mining pool operators, the feedback of the community is always only one step away.\nAltogether, the incident was handled very well, and all parts of the Bitcoin community should congratulate themselves for their speedy resolution of the problem and their unconditional cooperation. The Bitcoin community is not always in perfect harmony; Bitcoin gambling site SatoshiDice and a number of Bitcoin developers, notably Luke Dashjr, are usually at odds over concerns that SatoshiDice\u2019s large transaction count is bloating the Bitcoin blockchain, but yesterday differences were laid aside as the community worked together to solve the problem. We also learned a lot, and merchants are likely to be much more prepared for such incidents in the future, perhaps implementing techniques like automatic fork detection to handle forks and avoid double spends without immediate manual intervention. Before today, many people knew that some test for the Bitcoin network would come, whether at the 1 MB block size limit or else where, but just how the community would handle such a thing was an unknown. Now, the test has come and gone, and how the Bitcoin community handled the test is known to everyone: we passed with flying colors.", "year": 2013, "month": 3, "day": 13}

That means you are also responsible for knowing exactly how much your Bitcoin holdings have increased in dollar terms since you bought them. If you are a miner, it even means all those 1\u2019s and 0s sitting idly on your cold storage hard drive are now considered gross income. Naturally, this has produced some trepidation among Bitcoin lovers, who now are obliged to keep incredibly onerous tax records if they want to stay on the right side of the law.\nCompliance will almost assuredly be an ongoing issue, given the private nature of the technology. \u201cWhile users with sizeable Bitcoin wallets might be motivated to comply with the new policy, those with smaller wallets might not find the hassle worth their time,\u201d noted the Tax Foundation in a recent blog post on the ruling. But there may be some unforeseen issues for the IRS \u2014 and benefits for Bitcoin users. Given the inherent difficulty with enforcement, the IRS ruling could backfire if more people self-report their Bitcoin holdings as capital losses (in order to gain tax benefits) than capital gains.\nIf that happened, Bitcoin could essentially become a tax loophole. With the reliance on self-reported Bitcoin holdings and the anonymity of private wallets, the government may need an army of cryptographers and a substantial increase in audits to ensure compliance from small-time Bitcoiners. As with pirated movies and software, enforcement would need to be so draconian it is likely infeasible.\nBetter yet: if the Bitcoin community managed to change the protocol to increase the rate that miners can \u201cunlock\u201d new coins\u2026 Bitcoin might have a built-in incentive to both adopt the currency and report taxable earnings. Let\u2019s say that we accepted an inflationary Bitcoin, much like we have an inflationary dollar, around 2 or 3% annualized. At the end of the year, a consistently inflating bitcoin would trigger no capital gains liability, only capital losses, reducing the tax liability of the filer.\nIf this held, then Bitcoin could actually trigger regular refunds of varying quantities for both hoarders and spenders alike. Businesses large and small, as well as ordinary consumers could essentially earn a reduced tax burden every time they used Bitcoin, as long as its value kept falling.\nOf course, proceeds from Bitcoin sales would still have to be reported, but that is less of a problem than reporting every single capital gain throughout the year. So inflation could mitigate the worries that many Bitcoin businesses and investors have about the new IRS rules.\nA perpetually inflating Bitcoin would also be great for miners, in that it would both reduce the cost and increase the incentive to continue mining. It would also be great for law enforcement, since it would encourage voluntary tax compliance. This would also reduce the reporting burden for bitcoin users and add a little extra incentive to use the cryptocurrency. Everybody wins!\nIf the Bitcoin protocol doesn\u2019t change in this respect, some other cryptocurrency might realize a potential competitive advantage here and take its place as the electronic money of choice. Many economists have already pointed out that a deflating Bitcoin is going to stifle adoption. The IRS ruling will likely only make that worse, forcing the Bitcoin community to improvise.\nAt the end of the day, Bitcoin is a very unique tool with properties of both an asset and a currency. In that sense, it remains malleable, and with sufficient momentum, may continue to outwit attempts to control or stamp it out. \u201cWhile the IRS has finally provided an answer,\u201d said the Tax Foundation, \u201cthere are good reasons to believe that they got it wrong. Virtual currencies are tricky assets to categorize.\u201d\nAs Princess Leia said to Governor Tarkin in Episode IV: \u201cThe more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.\u201d\nIf the IRS starts to tighten that grip too much, expect Bitcoiners to start syncing up those wallets.\nAuthor\u2019s Note: Matt McKibbin of Liberty Panacea contributed to this post", "year": 2013, "month": 3, "day": 6}
{"title": "BitPay Exceeds $2 Million In Transactions Month-to-Date", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitpay-exceeds-2-million-in-transactions-month-to-date-1364246760/", "birthday": "Mar 25, 2013  5:26 PM EST", "date": "2013-03-25 22:26:00", "content": "BitPay, the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin payment processor, has announced that they have processed over $2 million in payments in the first 25 days of March. The company also reports that the rate of transactions is also accelerating, with 3,600 processed this month, and the total number of merchants that the company serves has now increased to over 4,000 \u2013 more than triple what it was in November before WordPress\u2019s announcement.\nAs a sign of Bitcoin\u2019s greater adoption, this news is very significant. As the Bitcoin price has now shot up by a factor of five since it first started its meteoric rise since the beginning of January, many people are becoming increasingly concerned that Bitcoin is entering another bubble, a cycle of self-reinforcing price increases and media attention that is not backed by any underlying adoption. If that is the case, then it means that the price could easily crash back down just as quickly, much like it did in 2011. Now, however, the opposite is clear; although Bitcoin\u2019s price and visibility have increased drastically over the past two months, at least for now adoption seems to be keeping up. Other data corroborates this; Bitcoin transaction counts are also going up, although not as quickly.\nIt should be noted that BitPay is far from the only payment processor in the Bitcoin economy; Reddit and Mega, two of the largest businesses to accept Bitcoin, use Coinbase and Zipbit, respectively. Thus, the Bitcoin economy is a lot larger than even the $2 million per month that BitPay reports. For a long time, critics of Bitcoin have claimed that the currency\u2019s primary use case is buying illicit goods such as drugs, citing statistics such as Silk Road\u2019s estimated revenue of $2 million per month from August 2012, but the new statistics clearly show that even if those claims were true in 2011 and early 2012, the \u201clegitimate\u201d Bitcoin economy is now much stronger.\nMerchants using BitPay also have another reason to rejoice. As a result of the company\u2019s success, CEO Tony Gallippi has announced that fees for all merchants, including those who are converting their earnings to any local currency that BitPay supports, will be reduced to 0.99% across the board. \u201cWe chose to celebrate this milestone by rewarding all merchants, large and small, with an across-the-board fee reduction, instead of offering tiered pricing which rewards only the largest merchants,\u201d Gallippi writes, \u201cWe want our merchants to use this fee reduction to offer discounts and incentives to their customers for paying with bitcoin.\u201d This price decrease in particular is very significant. With the new fees, if a buyer buys bitcoins through Coinbase, pays the money to a merchant in exchange for a product, and the merchant cashes out through BitPay, the round-trip fees add up to a total of 1.99% \u2013 less than the 2.90% + $0.25 charged by Visa and Mastercard. However, from the customer\u2019s point of view at most Bitcoin merchants buying with Bitcoin is still 1% more expensive, and so, at least for now, the buyer has no financial incentive to participate in the currency switch. This is why Bitcoin business advocates are now increasingly calling for Bitcoin businesses to pass on the savings through a discount, and some large players have already done so. The Bitcoin Store, for example, has been successfully offering its customers prices for electronics lower than what can be found almost anywhere else because of their savings from using Bitcoin, and they have already gotten more than $300,000 in purchases.\nOf course, fees are not the only savings with Bitcoin that businesses can make. Many merchants, including small businesses in particular, accepting credit cards are often forced to spend a significant portion of their time looking at customers\u2019 personal data to attempt to verify that the purchase is legitimate. With Bitcoin, merchants do not need to worry about fraudulent customers, resulting in savings of both loss to fraud and investigative effort that is potentially much greater than 2-3%. Discounts as high as 5 or even 10 percent may be justified on these grounds.\nFor businesses selling digital goods such as games and software, there is a strong case to make that the discounts that Bitcoin users should receive are even greater. To see why, it is important to understand that digital goods have a zero marginal cost of production \u2013 that is, when someone buys a movie, program, book or song the vendor must only pay a fraction of a cent transmitting the data to the buyer, pocketing the rest as pure profit. However, there is a hidden tax involved: the effort that the buyer needs to make to complete the transaction. In the case of credit cards, this involves filling in a form including credit card number, validation code and a full set of personal information \u2013 a process that may take the buyer several minutes to complete. In the case of Bitcoin, all it takes is copying an address or scanning a QR code. Now, imagine that a given song or mobile application is available for sale to two different groups using these two different methods for $1. A credit card user might value the time wasted filling in the form at an additional $1, while for the Bitcoin user the streamlined process of buying through Bitcoin would only \u201ccost\u201d $0.20. Consider what would happen if the price was increased to $1.60 for both groups. To credit card users, the total cost would go up from $2.00 to $2.60 \u2013 a 30% increase. To Bitcoin users, however, the cost would go up from $1.20 to $1.80, or 50%. Under normal circumstances, the 50% increase would deter a larger percentage of customers from buying the product than the 30% increase, and so it may well make economic sense to increase the price for credit card users and not Bitcoin users. Applying this effect across the board, it becomes clear that the optimum price for a digital good for Bitcoin users will often be much lower than that for credit card users.\nAt this point in Bitcoin\u2019s development, encouraging more merchants and customers to start using the currency is crucial for its continued growth. Potential Bitcoin users looking at Bitcoin need to see a reason to start using it to buy products and services, and at the same time merchants looking to start accepting Bitcoin need to see a sufficiently large potential customer base for accepting Bitcoin to be worth it. One of Bitcoin\u2019s major advantages is its low fees, but until now for most users and merchants that advantage has not been realized; merchant processing fees from BitPay were almost as large as those charged by Visa and MasterCard, and combined with Bitcoin exchange fees on the buyer\u2019s side it was Bitcoin that was the more expensive option. Now, merchant savings with Bitcoin have finally become a reality, and if merchants reciprocate by providing discounts, even if only 1% off the original price, both sides will be able to share in the savings. All in all, BitPay has just laid the groundwork for an even greater wave of adoption in the months to come.", "year": 2013, "month": 3, "day": 25}

When the exchange first launched in June 2011, MtGox was by far the dominant player in the market, with a market share approaching 95%, and Bitcoin users were eager to see some competition. Following a marketing blitz over the next two weeks, attention on Tradehill increased rapidly, and the exchange was further helped along by a security breach at MtGox which caused the Bitcoin price to appear to crash down to less than one cent. Over the next few months, the exchange continued to grow, and it seemed that if anyone would ever displace MtGox it would be them. However, soon Tradehill\u2019s luck turned for the worse. Near the end of 2011, Tradehill\u2019s main payment processing partner, Dwolla, made a sudden change to their policies: they started processing chargebacks. The move was a highly deceptive one; before then, \u201cno chargebacks\u201d had been a key part of Dwolla\u2019s sales pitch, and when the change was made Dwolla made no effort to inform its customers. Instead, Tradehill only found out that anything was wrong when $94,000 worth of transactions were essentially reversed without warning, and Tradehill\u2019s account frozen when they tried to move the remaining $70,000 to a safer location. Because of that loss, as well as increasing worries about the status of Bitcoin exchanges under US regulations, Tradehill shut down on February 15, 2012, and launched a lawsuit against Dwolla to attempt to recover its losses. From the point of view of most Bitcoin users, the exchange was never heard from again.\nThat is, until now. Two weeks ago, Tradehill\u2019s Jered Kenna announced that the company was back, and would soon be revealing a number of new Bitcoin exchange-related products. \u201cEver since I shut the original Tradehill down,\u201d Kenna relates, \u201cI was still getting calls on a regular basis from customers. In April 2012 I met a man at the future of money and tech conference, Ryan Singer.\u201d Singer continues, \u201cIn July and August we started talking about bringing Tradehill back. The goal was to be regulatorily certain where we stood, as well as from a security and technical perspective. Jered was really proud of his reputation for never losing any customer funds [a reputation that, of all other major exchanges from 2011, only BitStamp still retains]. We hired a new team from Google and Cloudflare, staffed up with designers and built a new product.\u201d\nThe first product that Tradehill is releasing is called Prime: a Bitcoin exchange specifically designed for the wealthy. So-called accredited investors, a classification open only those with a net worth of at least one million dollars not including their primary residence, are in fact much easier to deal with regulatorily than most other individuals. For example, while companies that would like to offer stock on public stock exchanges such as NASDAQ must go through a lengthy compliance process and have millions of dollars of capital, there are also specialized exchanges like SecondMarket where even lowly startups can register \u2013 but only accredited investors can trade. Also, dealing only with a small number of extremely high-value customers allows Prime to provide a much higher quality of customer service. \u201cWe can establish deep trust relationships,\u201d Singer adds, \u201cand even offer direct integration with automatic trading bots.\u201d\nPrime is not the first business to come up with such an idea; the Malta-based Exante has created a fund with a similar purpose of targeting institutional investors earlier in March. However, thanks to the way international financial regulation is currently set up the two are unlikely to be competitors. The United States government recently passed a law called the Foreign Account Tax Compliance ACT (FATCA), requiring any foreign financial services dealing with US customers to extensively report on their customers\u2019 activities to the US government. The law imposes a 30% withholding tax on any institution that deals with US customers but does not comply, and, furthermore, as Mike Hearn put it, the law is \u201cviral\u201d \u2013 institutions outside of the US that comply must also impose the 30% withholding tax themselves on other institutions that do not. \u201cBecause the financial system is a fully connected graph,\u201d Hearn explains, \u201cthis essentially means that US law spreads through it like an infection and eventually every financial institution will be forced to comply or face crippling sanctions from other financial institutions they interact with.\u201d With this in mind, the majority of foreign financial institutions, including non-US-based Bitcoin businesses like Bitcoin Central, are choosing a much easier way out: stop dealing with US customers at all. This is the path that Exante will most likely take, leaving Prime in the United States, at least for now, all by itself.\nAlthough Prime and Exante\u2019s BitcoinFund are similar in spirit, they are quite different in implementation. Kenna explains: \u201c[Prime] is more of an investment club than a fund \u2013 people are trading bitcoins with each other, we just write software to facilitate.\u201d The company intends to offer the highest possible level of customer service, including personalized assistance from a professional accountant for all of their clients, as well as integration with automatic trading bots, instant extremely high value bank deposits and withdrawals, and more. An investor seeking to buy $500,000 of BTC through MtGox would likely have a hard time getting their money in; with Prime, the banking integration systems are designed to do just that. For sellers, Prime has another proposition to make: above-market prices. The demand from institutional investors looking to get into Bitcoin is highly asymmetrical, and so it is quite likely that the market price on Prime will slightly exceed the price everywhere else. Given the rate at which the Bitcoin price has been moving over the last two months even a 5% surcharge is worth less than a single-day delay, so even to buyers Prime\u2019s offer will still be extremely compelling.\nPrime has already found 75 customers, each with over $10,000 worth of bitcoin, and is gaining more every day. Kenna says, \u201cpeople are saying to me, \u2018I want to sell $500,000 worth of Bitcoin'\u201d Given recent announcements from Coinlab, Exante and increasing numbers of Silicon Valley investors looking at Bitcoin businesses, institutional investor interest into Bitcoin is at an all-time high, and is only going to become greater over the next year.\nFor the curious, the old Tradehill is still involved in the dispute with Dwolla, and the new Tradehill was formed as a separate company. But Prime is only the first of many offerings that Tradehill has in store. Kenna is primarily in the business to help Bitcoin grow, and he realizes as well as anyone else that it is ultimately the average users that will drive Bitcoin to success. A traditional Bitcoin exchange for the masses is soon to come, although Tradehill is unwilling to reveal too much just yet. The main delays are regulatory, ensuring that the exchange will not be blindsided by a sudden change in policy from governments or payment processors again. \u201cTradehill has been dedicated to being fully compliant with US laws,\u201d Singer adds, \u201cand not being murky about it.\u201d", "year": 2013, "month": 3, "day": 28}
{"title": "Bitcoin Developer Confirms Butterfly Labs ASIC", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-developer-receives-first-butterfly-labs-asic-1364858475/", "birthday": "Apr 1, 2013  7:21 PM EST", "date": "2013-04-02 00:21:00", "content": "Bitcoin developer Luke Dashjr has confirmed that a prototypes Butterfly Labs ASIC is now hashing. The device is still far from full capacity, pushing out only 25 GH/s at a power consumption of 180 watts, but this is nevertheless the first definitive proof that Butterfly Labs is producing a legitimate product, and is not too far from finally releasing its first batch.\nButterfly Labs\u2019 Josh Zerlan also recently provided updates on the state of Butterfly Labs\u2019 production in an IRC channel. The core of the conversation is this:\nBFL_Josh: Well guys, I had planned on updating everyone with a video of a board hashing here in KC tonight, but I haven\u2019t been able to get that together yet, so I\u2019m probably going to have to push it off until tomorrow. We are targeting a start of shipment next week, but I\u2019m not quite ready to commit to that at the moment, given our past estimates. It\u2019s imminent, though.  Lab_Rat: It hashes????  BFL_Josh: Yes, it hashes\nFurther down in the conversation, Zerlan provides the main reasons for the current delay. Zerlan writes: \u201cWe may miss our power targets, that\u2019s been part of the hold up\u2026 we think there\u2019s a problem with the power consumption and we\u2019re trying to figure out where it\u2019s having an issue \u2026 What\u2019s causing even more consternation is the fact that the wafer we burned for tests runs at far less power than a second wafer we mounted on the BGA package\u2026 so it may be a wafer by wafer thing, and since we only have two datapoints, it\u2019s hard to nail down the issue.\u201d To many in the field, these difficulties are unsurprising; in mid-January, Avalon founder Yifu Guo wrote on the topic \u201crecently they changed it to 1.2W, but they won\u2019t even reach that. We ran 65nm simulations and they should be around 3W.\u201d But to many of Butterfly Labs\u2019 customers, who have now suffered from six months of delays, power consumption does not even matter; given that every extra day represents a lost opportunity for profit that will never come back, almost any level of power consumption is acceptable if it means that the devices will ship faster.\nButterfly Labs\u2019 shipment has been awaited by the community for nearly ten months; the company was in fact the first to start accepting pre-orders in June 2012. Although the original shipping date was scheduled for October, the company suffered a number of delays that changed their expected shipping date first to late November, then early January, then mid-February and finally where it is today. In the meantime two other major ASIC producers, Avalon and ASICMiner, have also started hashing, and are partially responsible for raising the network hashpower from 20 TH/s to 55 TH/s over the past three months (the other contributing factor being the rapidly increasing BTC price). However, the community is still watching Butterfly Labs intently for one key reason: its potential hashpower. Although the output of Avalon and ASICMiner has been small, with Avalon\u2019s first release being 20 TH/s and ASICMiner\u2019s launch 12 TH/s, Butterfly Labs\u2019 preorders altogether make up over 60 TH/s \u2013 more than is currently on the entire Bitcoin network.\nFor the security of the Bitcoin network, it is arguably quite fortunate that Butterfly Labs has been delayed by so much; if their machines had come any earlier, or even today, the company would have had access to more hashpower than the rest of the entire Bitcoin network put together, fundamentally compromising a key assumption of Bitcoin\u2019s security. This threat was a major reason why Avalon founder Yifu Guo decided to go ahead with his project; \u201cthat was our main goal \u2013 we wanted to prevent this potential monopoly,\u201d Guo wrote in a recent interview. However, it turned out that the major providers released in just the right order; Avalon started shipping their first, 20 TH/s, batch first on Jan 19, although all but two of their devices were delayed by many weeks after that date. ASICMiner started hashing on Feb 14, starting off with 2 TH/s and slowly ramping up over the past two months, and over these past two months hundreds of anonymous GPU miners turned on their hardware because of the increased mining profitability from Bitcoin\u2019s rapidly growing price.\nThe rapidly rising Bitcoin price has been a massive boon to the Bitcoin mining industry in general. Since the beginning of the year, the Bitcoin price has risen from $13.3 to over $100, making mining extremely profitable for those lucky enough to have the hardware to do it. The fact that Bitcoin mining is now so heavily focused on specialized hardware compounds the advantage; while in 2010 or 2011 such price increases were quickly met with large numbers of off-the-shelf GPUs joining the network, now the most powerful miners are all specialized devices, and production takes months to compensate for the increased demand. When Jeff Garzik received Avalon\u2019s first ASIC at the end of January, the device paid for itself in nine days, and its profitability since then has only increased. As a result, Avalon has raised the price on their third batch to 75 BTC, or $7,500, and has nevertheless sold a significant number of units. Because ASICMiner is not selling their hardware, instead selling shares and doing mining in-house, they can benefit from the increased value of their revenues directly. Notably, Butterfly Labs has not increased their prices, but even if they continue to keep their prices the same they will still benefit massively from increased sales.\nIn the next few months, Bitcoin network hashpower will only continue to increase. Avalon\u2019s three shipments altogether will make up a total of 1500 units, or over 75 TH/s, and ASICMiner is planning 50 TH/s by the end of April, and 200 TH/s soon after. By the end of the year, ASICMiner\u2019s friedcat writes on Bitcointalk, ASICMiner\u2019s total hashpower may be as high as 1000 TH/s, and friedcat even adds that \u201csome may say that 1,000TH/s at the end of this year is too conservative.\u201d", "year": 2013, "month": 4, "day": 2}
{"title": "BitPay Processes $5 Million in March, Eclipses Silk Road", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitpay-processes-5-million-in-march-eclipses-silk-road-1364929315/", "birthday": "Apr 2, 2013  3:01 PM EST", "date": "2013-04-02 20:01:00", "content": "A week ago, BitPay CEO Tony Gallippi announced that his payment processing service had set a new record: a transaction volume of $2 million in the first twenty five days of March. Now, however, Gallippi has revealed that the popular Bitcoin payment processor has eclipsed that figure yet again, and in a third of the time \u2013 leading to a new record high transaction volume of 5.2 million dollars for the month of March.\nBitPay\u2019s growth in the past month has been very rapid; in February, Gallippi reports, the company only processed a total of $687,000 from 2,300 completed invoices. In March, the transaction volume of $5.2 million comes from 5,100 completed invoices, and the company also added 1,300 new merchants, raising their total to 4,500 as of the end of the month. Although it cannot be said for certain, the figure also likely places the total aggregate of BitPay merchant sales above those processed by the Silk Road, the notorious online black market for illegal drugs that uses Tor and Bitcoin, combined with a proprietary mixing service, to ensure that both the internet connections and the payments of its users remain anonymous. The site was last estimated to have a volume of $2 million by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University in August 2012, and since then the one public statistic released by Silk Road \u2013 the number of users and posts on its forum, has increased by about 50-100%, suggesting a current volume of around $3 million to $5 million. From a public relations standpoint, this is a positive sign for Bitcoin: the legal Bitcoin economy is now almost certainly larger than the illegal one, especially when one takes other merchant services like WalletBit/BIPS and Coinbase into consideration, and is growing at a much faster rate.\nGallippi suggests several reasons that may be the driving factors behind BitPay\u2019s sudden surge in volume. First of all, on March 25 the company lowered transaction fees for merchants receiving their revenue as bank deposits from 2.69% to 0.99%, making the round-trip process of buying Bitcoin (1.00% flat fee at Coinbase), sending it to a merchant and having the merchant convert the bitcoins back into fiat even cheaper than the 2.90% fee charged by Visa and MasterCard. And some merchants are even passing on the savings; \u201cwith our recent reduction in fees, our merchants are using our all-inclusive 0.99% fee to offer discounts to their customers for paying in bitcoin,\u201d Gallippi writes.\nThe other major factor is two specific businesses; the Bitcoin Store and Avalon. The Bitcoin Store first opened in November with a simple proposition: hundreds of thousands of electronics products for sale, all cheaper than anywhere else on the internet \u2013 major retailers like Amazon and NewEgg included. The company would use the advantages of chargeback-free and cheap payment processing offered by Bitcoin and BitPay, together with a contract with the wholesaler Ingram negotiated by Roger Ver, to lower their costs as much as possible, and pass on the savings to consumers. At the end of February, seeking to reach the volume threshold needed to retain its high-discount contract with Ingram the Bitcoin Store launched a promotion: 0% markup on all purchases. The promotion was hugely successful; the site processed nearly $500,000 in sales in March, much of which was in the last week, and although this is below the original volume threshold of $850,000 Bitcoin Store\u2019s Jon Holmquist writes that \u201ceven if we don\u2019t get to renew our current contract with Ingram we\u2019ll just get a slightly worse contract.\u201d The deadline has now passed, so the Bitcoin Store will be giving an update on the fate of the contract very soon.\nAvalon is the first seller of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)-based Bitcoin mining hardware to release a functional product. Because Avalon\u2019s major competitor, Butterfly Labs, has been delayed by several months with a working prototype confirmed only yesterday, and because of the recent meteoric rise in the Bitcoin price Avalon\u2019s hardware has been hugely profitable for those lucky enough to have bought it; Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik\u2019s Avalon device paid for itself in nine days, and given the current Bitcoin price and network statistics it is producing an even higher USD-denominated revenue today. As a result, Yifu Guo has increased the price on the third batch from $1500 to 75 BTC \u2013 over $6500 throughout the last week of March, and yet people are continuing to buy them.\nOf course, the Bitcoin economy as a whole, and even \u201cjust\u201d the legal Bitcoin economy, is larger than just BitPay, and BitPay\u2019s alternatives are all growing at the same time. Reddit uses Coinbase to process payments, Mega uses Zipbit, Avalon rotates between the various payment processors for its batches and many other businesses use custom platforms developed in-house. Furthermore, sales are not the only economic activity that takes place; an small but increasing number of businesses is now paying its employees in BTC. Thus, the Bitcoin economy as a whole, even not taking into account Silk Road, is likely considerably larger than $5 million per month \u2013 yet more evidence that Bitcoin\u2019s recent rise in media attention and popularity is more than just speculation.", "year": 2013, "month": 4, "day": 2}
{"title": "BitcoinStore Sells $500,000, Renews Ingram Contract", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoinstore-sells-500000-renews-ingram-contract-1364950812/", "birthday": "Apr 2, 2013  9:00 PM EST", "date": "2013-04-03 02:00:00", "content": "The BitcoinStore, a very popular electronics retailer in the Bitcoin community, has announced that has managed to keep its contract with its wholesaler, and so will continue be able to continue selling goods at its current low prices. The store first launched in November 2012 with a simple proposition: hundreds of thousands of electronics products for sale for bitcoin, all cheaper than anywhere else on the internet \u2013 major retailers like Amazon and NewEgg included. Because the BitcoinStore is Bitcoin-only, it would not have to pay any of the costs associated with accepting credit cards, including the standard 2.9% fee, PCI compliance, identifying potentially fraudulent purchases and handling chargebacks, and the key attraction of the store is that it would pass these savings on directly to the consumer. On top of this, Bitcoin entrepreneur Roger Ver secured for the BitcoinStore another advantage: a contract with Ingram Micro, which describes itself as \u201cthe world\u2019s largest distributor of computer and technology products\u201d, at the highest possible tier of discounting. That is, despite being a less than six month old startup, the BitcoinStore has been able to buy its products from Ingram at the same prices available to the largest eletronics retailers in the world.\nHowever, the contract came with a string attached: the BitcoinStore had to reach a sales volume of $850,000 in the first quarter of 2013 to maintain it. In the first three months of operation from mid-November to February, the store saw some attention, but by Feruary it became clear that they were simply not getting enough \u2013 with little over a month left, the BitcoinStore still had over $800,000 to go. At that point, Jon Holmquist and Roger Ver were desperate, and sought to save their business with a bold move. On February 27, the store officially launched, a step that the two were delaying until then due to issues with the website, and offered its customers the ultimate discount: a 0% markup on all purchases. The pair also launched a massive marketing campaign, and pleaded with the Bitcoin community to support them during this critical time. Orders came rolling in; the BitcoinStore earned nearly $300,000 by mid-March, and by the end of the month the figure was up to $500,000.\nThus, the BitcoinStore did not quite live up to the original conditions of the deal, but since, as Jon Homlquist has just announced, the contract has been renewed, Ingram was clearly sufficiently impressed by the last month\u2019s performance \u2013 or by the rapid growth of the Bitcoin community as a whole \u2013 to give the store another chance. The BitcoinStore now has to earn another $850,000 of revenue by June 30 to keep its contract once again \u2013 a goal that is still not that easy to reach, as it must now continue to earn $283,000 per month even though many of its potential customers have already bought everything that they needed in March, but Holmquist is confident that they will succeed. \u201cWe\u2019ll be pushing ads heavily and will be launching some new programs to introduce new people to Bitcoin,\u201d Holmquist writes.\nThe success of the BitcoinStore, together with the success of so many other BitPay merchants in the month of March, makes a strong case for the strength of the Bitcoin economy; although over the past thirty days the currency has been massively deflationary, with its value rising nearly 200% from $31.25 to $93.03 over the month of March, at the same time sales are higher than ever. Of course, this is very far from a solid empirical argument that deflationary economies are superior, or even work, in the context of a full-scale society, but does deliver a strong blow to concerns that the Bitcoin economy will somehow asphyxiate itself as the price goes up due to lack of spending.\nThe BitcoinStore will, for now, be keeping its 0% markup, and Ver is okay with taking a small loss to keep the store running. To him, the BitcoinStore is not intended so much to be a profit-making business, but rather a proof of concept, a business that shows just what becomes possible in the world of e-commerce once all of the inefficiencies of legacy payment systems are stripped away. The intended audience of Ver\u2019s performance? The very same mainstream electronics retailers that the BitcoinStore\u2019s prices are now crushing. \u201cYou all are a huge part of that global marketplace. You all have been approached about accepting Bitcoin and yet not one of you has started accepting Bitcoin payments. Our sales show that there are consumers out there that want to purchase electronics with Bitcoin\u2026 And our prices show that Bitcoin can dramatically lower prices.\u201d\nWith today\u2019s announcement, however, Ver has upgraded the message to a warning: accept Bitcoin, or accept our wrath. \u201cSo here\u2019s the deal I want to make with each of you,\u201d Ver writes, \u201caccept Bitcoin payments by the end of 2013 and we\u2019ll gladly close down our website. But if you don\u2019t accept Bitcoin\u2026 we\u2019ll keep rolling. We have already made over a half million in sales and we have only been open a month! If you don\u2019t listen to your consumers, we\u2019ll continue taking them from you. I assure you, Bitcoin is geeky enough to appeal to many of your consumers, and the savings we provide is convincing enough for many others.

{"title": "Mt. Gox DDoS and the Panic-Sell Price Drop", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/mt-gox-ddos-and-the-panic-sell-price-drop-1365285837/", "birthday": "Apr 6, 2013  6:03 PM EST", "date": "2013-04-06 23:03:00", "content": "Distributed Denial-of-Services (DDOS) attacks conducted against Mt. Gox over the last few days were responsible for server lag and downtime which lead to a ripple of panic-selling and, ultimately, a brief non-sustained drop in the trading price on Mt. Gox and other online exchanges subsequently. The event found mainstream media coverage, with unusual haste, including on CNBC\u2019s website featuring a sensationalized and misleading headline, \u201cBitcoin Hacked: Price Stumbles After Buying Frenzy.\u201d The day ended with the price on a steady recovery and Bitcoin itself remained unscathed.\nOn the morning of April third, the USD trading price at Mt. Gox started at about $115 and rapidly rose above $145 before dropping just as quickly to $127 (bitcoincharts). After a brief recovery, it dropped again to just below $115, floundered for a short time and now appears to steadily rising just over $143, for the moment at least. Other major Bitcoin exchanges saw similar price instability, although to a lesser degree, which can likely be attributed to Mt. Gox\u2019s trading volume. The company claims to serve the vast majority of Bitcoin currency trades, so what happens there is bound to have some effect on overall confidence and speculation. Meanwhile, in-person trade prices held strong.\nIn a press release that was issued on Thursday, following the blitz, Mt. Gox outlined a specific way that DDoS can be used for monetary gain in the market: \u201cAttackers wait until the price of Bitcoins reaches a certain value, sell, destabilize the exchange, wait for everybody to panic-sell their Bitcoins, wait for the price to drop to a certain amount, then stop the attack and start buying as much as they can. Repeat this two or three times like we saw over the past few days and they profit.\u201c\nThe use of DDoS is notorious for shutting down websites, often with large numbers of individuals playing a part. These attacks are very common throughout the world wide web, nearly every large website has been forced to confront this problem and, especially when there\u2019s the possibility of financial gain, they should be expected. It would be folly to presume that DDoS assaults will ever cease. In actuality, they will probably increase in magnitude and frequency until a more effective tool is created to cripple websites. Things can be done to mitigate the downtime and server instability but, in the end, no real damage has been done to Bitcoin or the blockchain and the people who did not panic and did not sell, did not actually lose anything.\nThe reactions to the Mt. Gox website instability illustrate several facets of recent market activities and represents increasingly urgent challenges to the community. First, and perhaps most obvious, is the need for diversification in the exchange space to reduce dependence on a single entity for weighing the value of the currency. If Mt. Gox was not the leading exchange with such a large percentage of currency trades then this would not be as big of an issue and the panic that drove the price down would have been contained to a smaller group of people.\nThe single most important thing for all Bitcoin users to keep in mind when dealing with scenarios like these is, as Mt. Gox states in the press release, \u201cDon\u2019t Panic! \u2026 Bitcoin, despite being designed to have its value increase over time, will always be the victim of people trying to abuse the system, or even the value of Bitcoin decreasing occasionally. These are not new phenomena and have been present since the beginning of time when humans first started trading.\u201d\nThe recent surge in price, over the last few months, is surely feeding a bit of market anxiety in Bitcoin users, old and new, who may be weary of a possible sudden devaluation as seen in June 2011. A quick enough price drop in a large exchange could, potentially, trigger a very serious panic-induced sell-off, thus flooding the market with cheap coins. Now, things are much different than they were in June 2011, though. The resilience of Bitcoin\u2019s technology, economy and community have been tested many times, in many ways, since its inception and have prevailed, in nearly all instances, with notable grace under fire. The DDoS attack this week now stands as another example of that fortitude.\nMt. Gox deserves some praise for handling the server defence and customer support as well as they did. Without due diligence on the part of the staff there and the support systems of DDoS protection companies like Prolexic the exchange could have suffered much worse, which would, at this particular point in time, almost certainly drag overall Bitcoin confidence down with it.\nWhen it comes to individual self-control and maintaining some level of sanity in an historically volatile market, timid Bitcoiners might consider taking slow, small steps at first and keep some of your bitcoins moving by spending or selling periodically instead of betting your life savings in hopes of turning a quick profit. For price-junkies who follow the market constantly and in several ways, it might be advisable to watch multiple exchanges and, for the sake of your blood pressure, mostly pay attention to the weighted average price rather than the often excessively-hyperactive latest.", "year": 2013, "month": 4, "day": 6}

Bitcoin\u2019s gambling websites, including SatoshiDice, BitZino and Seals With Clubs, all reported record volumes. All three major merchant service providers either expanded their offerings in some way or lowered their fees. Bitcoin\u2019s statistics, including number of transactions, market capitalization and trade volume, were higher than they ever were in history, and those that still remained were higher than at any point after the bubble of 2011. Many people, including myself, predicted that the onslaught of increasing media attention would not last. However, in February we were proven wrong. Reddit and Kim Dotcom\u2019s Mega, two of the most widely known names in the internet community, started accepting bitcoins for payment, and popular domain name registrar and webhost Namecheap followed suit in March. The Bitcoin price surged past higher than it ever did before, and positive media attention kept on coming. Even the few security crises that Bitcoin had during this time were either ignored or even treated as positive news, with journalists praising the Bitcoin community\u2019s speed and efficiency at handling the issues as they came up. Here is an overview of all that happened in these past two months.\nAll Time High!\nThe Bitcoin price broke through the all-time high of $31.91 that it had set back in June 2011, and started rising even faster past that point, approaching $100 at the end of the month.Soon following Bitcoin\u2019s thrust past $32, a number of popular news sites ran articles strongly in favor of Bitcoin, including The Guardian\u2019s \u201cBitcoin: More Than Just the Currency of Vice\u201d, Business Insider\u2019s \u201cBitcoin Just Took a Key Step Toward Being Mainstream\u201d and vice.com\u2019s \u201cIs It Time to Take Bitcoin Seriously?\u201d.The weekly Google Trends volume surged past its 2011 all-time high, a rise of over 300% since January. The monthly volume for March did not quite beat that of June 2011, reaching only 98% of the high (a figure that has already been massively overshot in the beginning days of April).Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization broke through $1 billion, and the number of transactions and the growth of the blockchain size continued rising.Interest in Bitcoin in Spain increased massively following the crisis in Cyprus, and some download statistics for Bitcoin clients in spain have increased by a factor of ten.BitPay announced that it had processed a transaction volume of $5.2 million during the month of March, and now has 4,500 merchants.The Bitcoin Reddit community at reddit.com/r/bitcoin became the 65th largest on the site by the average number of subscribers online, surpassing many other communities including \u201cr/relationships\u201c, \u201cr/humor\u201c, \u201cr/seduction\u201c, \u201cr/Drugs\u201c, \u201cr/baseball\u201d and \u201cr/food\u201c.\nJust A Little Blockchain Glitch\nThe BitLC Bitcoin exchange announced that it would be closing since one of the company\u2019s key shareholders, also the holder of the company\u2019s cold storage wallet, disappeared with a large portion of customers\u2019 funds.BitInstant had its VirWoX account hacked through a combination of social engineering and DNS spoofing, costing them $12,000.Because of a bug in bitcoind 0.7, the Bitcoin blockchain split into two, with bitcoind and BitcoinQt 0.7 clients on one chain and bitcoind and BitcoinQt 0.8 users, and most others, on the other. The event led to the Bitcoin price temporarily falling from $48.5 to $36.5, but the problem was quickly solved and the price recovered to $45 within a day. A number of news sources reported on the incident, but nearly all were either neutral or even positive, praising the Bitcoin community\u2019s response and the price\u2019s quick recovery.\nBusiness Adoption\neToro, a site that describes itself as the \u201cworld\u2019s largest social investing network\u201d, announced that it will soon accept bitcoin deposits.The Malta-based financial broker Exante announced its new Bitcoin hedge fund, allowing institutional investors to easily and safely invest into the Bitcoin market.Reddit started accepting bitcoins for its premium Reddit Gold service, becoming the second most popular website after WordPress to accept Bitcoin, and its parent company Advance Publications became the largest company to accept Bitcoin, eclipsing Wuala\u2018s parent company LaCie (which no longer accepts Bitcoin, likely due to lack of interest).Kim Dotcom announced BitVoucher, a Mega reseller which allows users to buy Mega\u2019s premium file sharing services for bitcoins. Although Mega was already purchaseable for BTC through hosting.co.uk, BitVoucher was significant because it carried Kim Dotcom\u2019s personal endorsement.Namecheap, a popular domain registrar and seller of web hosting and VPS services, announced that it would accept bitcoins as payment.WinPoker, a poker site connected to the iPoker network, the largest collection of online poker sites in the world, started accepting Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals.The Internet Archive announced that it would start paying a portion of some of its employees\u2019 salaries with bitcoins, and received over $1000 in donations during the day following the announcement.The Finnish software developer SC5 announced that it would start paying employees\u2019 salaried in Bitcoin as well.Expensify, the world\u2019s most popular application for submitting expense reports, added an option for users to ask for their expenses to be repaid in Bitcoin.E-Gov Link, a suite of services for local governments seeking to interact with their constituents online, announced Bitcoin integration into their products. \u201cNow municipalities can offer their citizens another option in paying for services like permits, utilities, class or event registration, shelter reservations, or even parking tickets,\u201d the press release reads.\nDevelopments from the Inside\nPizza for Coins, a site that acts as a proxy for users to order pizza at Domino\u2019s, Pizza Hut and Papa John\u2019s, launched in February, receiving widespread media attention.Soon after, Bitspend opened its doors, allowing users to buy anything available for credit card payment online for bitcoins. When the site first opened, it was overwhelmed with orders and had to close its doors within hours to keep up with the demans. The site re-launched the following week, and also received its share of media attention, although less than Pizza for Coins.Bitcoin Wireless ran its public beta, allowing mobile phone users to top of their phone plans with bitcoins at or in some cases even below cost.Coinlab announced a deal with MtGox in which it will take over transactions for US and Canada clients, allowing US and Canadian users to exchange their bitcoins through the service without paying high international banking fees.BitPay received another round of venture capital funding, helping to pay for its recent move to Atlanta and hiring an expanded team of new developers.OpenCoin made the first major release of Ripple, an alternative cryptocurrency network that would give customers the ability to hold and send any supported currency, including USD, EUR, CHF and in the future possibly even gold and silver, in a decentralized fashion.The BitcoinStore, a Bitcoin-only electronics retailer that offers hundreds of thousands of products often cheaper than anywhere else on the internet, sold $500,000 worth of goods in the first quarter of 2011 and managed to renew the contract providing them with top-tier discounting from their distributor, Ingram Micro.Tradehill, a popular Bitcoin exchange from 2011 that shut down over a year ago due to legal issues, announced their return to the Bitcoin community, releasing their first new product: Prime, a Bitcoin exchange specifically designed for high-net-worth institutional investors.\nToday, Bitcoin is in that same zone of uncertainty that it was in in the late stages of the run-up to the crash in June 2011. Public interest is continuing, although the focus of media attention has, perhaps unfortunately, slowly shifted from focusing on Bitcoin\u2019s properties to its rapidly increasing value. The price appears to be entering a full-on mania phase, so we should all be prepared for a crash; for those who have earned a small fortune from Bitcoin\u2019s increasing balue already, taking at least once or twice one\u2019s initial investment out is likely the right thing to do, if only to preserve one\u2019s sanity. But in the long term, the future for Bitcoin is looking brighter than ever. We have seen venture capital investors increasingly looking into Bitcoin, unprecedented Bitcoin adoption with reports of more adoption soon to come, and public attention is increasing on all fronts. Although few believed that this would happen in the bleak months of October and November 2011, over the past two years the Bitcoin economy has grown by a factor of over a hundred. Just imagine what Bitcoin in the spring of 2015 will be like.", "year": 2013, "month": 4, "day": 5}

People are paying attention to it. But is it for real?\"\nHis response: \"Yes, it is definitely is for real. I remember the first time I encouraged people to buy bitcoins it was around a nickel per bitcoin and now it is around $133. So those people who would have followed that advice would have been able to participate in one of the largest bull markets in history, and this bull market is not even close to being over.\"\nWhy is this bull market not even close to being over?\nSellers Remorse\nPrice discovery is always an interesting phenomenon. There are always bulls and always bears. The scoreboard is kept in profits and is the only opinion that matters. The next decades, and particularly the next six months, are going to be extremely exciting with the bitcoin price.\nYou may be tempted to sell but seller's remorse is a terrible feeling. If you have done the analysis and taken the risk only to sell out before realizing the vast majority of profits , it can leave a particularly bitter taste in one's investing mouth.\nIt is even worse than just missing out on an opportunity. After all, who wants to be like the Litecoin trader with seller's remorse? One sad tale on Reddit describes how a buyer picked up 80,000 litecoins at $0.068in January 2013 and sold them at $0.20. Litecoins reached $5 before moving down to around $3.5o today. So while he realized a 194% return, or $10,560, he missed out on a 7,250% return, or $394,560 and is feeling seller's remorse. Kind of the opposite of David Choe who could have gotten a few thousand dollars for painting a mural at Facebook but instead got stock that turned into $200 million. You have to be in it to win it!\nWhy the Price of Bitcoin is \"Melting Up\"\nIn financial terms, a price can \"melt up\" when it is significantly undervalued. I wrote about this Bitcoin price melt-up starting on 21 March 2013 and predicted that \"I think a fair value price for bitcoins is around 3-7 bitcoins per ounce of gold.\" With the ratio currently at about 10 bitcoins per ounce of gold; that prediction may turn out to be overly conservative and now we are seeing it happen.\nThen we have financial fools like Michael Pento, others who have not been around the Bitcoin market very long, and still more who have not done very much substantive due diligence except to reference the bitcoin price chart. All of them loudly proclaim there is a Bitcoin bubble.\nBut they missed out on the previous large gains in the Bitcoin price and they know it by looking at their own balance sheets. Scoreboard! So, why would any rational bitcoin holders lend them any creditability? Instead, how about we freshly analyze the state of the Bitcoin economy, apply where we think the price could go, and then come to a conclusion on what long-time members of the Bitcoin community should do to profit the most.\nFirst, we have little, scrappy, run-of-the-mill Bitcoin investors like Jeremy Liew making outlandish statements like. \"In all the scenarios that I've painted above, Bitcoin prices need to go up by 100x or more.'\nSo who is Jeremy Liew? Well, he was\\named to the Forbes' Midas list in 2011 and 2012, has received an MBA from Stanford and is a partner and managing director at Lightspeed Venture Partners, which has backed over 200 companies and is currently investing out of a $675m fund. He also recently wrote an article for TechCrunch titled Why VCs Love The Bitcoin Market. Jeremy Liew is not alone among his Silicon Valley VCs and Wall Streeters. There's also Adam Draper, an established VC, who will 'incubate 5-7 Bitcoin related companies in our next batch'. Why?\nThe reasons stated earlier are: (1) increased investor confidence in the Bitcoin protocol, (2) reduced legal uncertainty from FinCEN guidelines, (3) Cyprus bank deposit seizures, (4) current adoption by large tech companies like Wordpress, Reddit, Expensify and Namecheap and (5) the rising price where he stated \\'My prediction - Bitcoin hits $225 by August.\\'And how about Fred Wilson a principal of Union Square Ventures who made a crap-ton of profits backing Zynga, Twitter, SoundCloud, Meetup, Foursquare, Etsy and plenty of others. Over a year ago, when prices were around $5, he wrote, \\'I\\'ve mentioned Bitcoin a number of times on this blog. It is something our firm is watching closely.\\' And what do you think he has been doing over the past year? Right, just twiddling his thumbs watching the Bitcoin juggernaut gain financial mass and transactional momentum.And how about the recent frontpage article in the Financial Times? The relevant passage: \"Some finance industry entrepreneurs have leapt at the opportunity. Exante, a Malta-based asset manager, set up a Bitcoin fund last year that was largely intended as a fun punt. Wealthy investors each put in $1,000 when Bitcoins were trading at $13 on the understanding they could lose the original investment. Exante predicted that public and media interest would take off when Bitcoins were trading at $100. Managing partner Gatis Eglitis claims they are now getting 20 calls a day from large asset managers looking to invest up to $100m.\"Plus, most of the VCs and Wall Streeters including in my opinion Mr. Liew, Mr. Draper, and Mr. Wilson, do not really know what is going on in the Bitcoin economy and are operating on incomplete data. As I explained to one of Mr. Wilson\\'s associates, all they really see is the tip of the iceberg because of Bitcoin\\'s increasing role as a\\xc2\\xa0settlement currency. If they could see the full iceberg then the feeding frenzy would really get crazy.But people like Roger Ver, long-time Bitcoin advocate, knows what is going on and is willing to put his money where his mouth is as evident from this 4 Aug 2011 video where offered to make a $10,000 bet that Bitcoin would outperform either gold, silver, the S&P 500 or the USD by 100x over the next two years.[youtuber youtube=\\'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfydIbhduu0\\']At the time of his bet gold was trading at $1,664.25, silver at $41.62 the S&P 500 at $1,200 and bitcoins at $9.26. Currently gold is trading at $1,580.70, silver at $27.12, S&P 500 at $1,553 and bitcoins at $160.00. So, only the S&P has outperformed the USD with a 29.4% return compared to bitcoin\\'s 1,633% return or 55.5x the S&P 500\\'s return.It will be interesting to see whether Roger Ver\\'s prediction comes true within the next four months. Assuming the S&P 500\\'s return stays the same at 29.4% return then the approximate bitcoin price will need to be around $270. But anyway you analyze it the bottom line is clear: Those who followed Mr. Ver\\'s advice would have profited greatly!The bottom line: there are a ton of funds flowing into Bitcoin. And nothing could be more exciting for the bitcoin price than a feeding frenzy of well capitalized financial sharks in a market as tight as Bitcoin who then have a financial incentive to build out the infrastructure that will enable greater adoption, hyper-monetization with Bitcoin \\'going viral\\' as a currency (the opposite of hyperinflation) and the accompanying network effects.Second, the economic characteristics of Bitcoin are like a Giffen good which inverts the traditional supply and demand effects. With Bitcoin the supply is fixed and known to all market participants. However, what is unknown is the float that is available for sale; which I will get to later.There is only transactional and speculative demand. For transactional demand the price is irrelevant. So that simply leaves speculative demand. And since Bitcoin is a Giffen good that is produced only to be hoarded and not consumed therefore it has a paradoxical effect: As the bitcoin price rises it decreases float supply and increases demand.The bottom line: You better strap yourself in and make sure your bitcoins are in cold storage because this price discovery is going to be a \\'4G inverted dive\\' that may cause you to blackout thinking you are lucid dreaming because the traditional ways of analyzing this Bitcoin market and its players are inverted. I would tell you but the \\'Bitcoin gods\\' have deemed it classified.[youtuber youtube=\\'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUZxSf_P2r0\\']\nHOW TO MAXIMIZE YOUR RIDING OF THIS BULL MARKET\nA rise in the price of bitcoins represents a wealth transfer from holders of some other assets to holders of bitcoins. Having been involved in Bitcoin for such a long time and having known, worked with and strategized with so many people therefore I really hope the Bitcoin community gets to benefit from this massive upcoming wealth transfer and not sell out early like the Litecoin trader.[youtuber youtube=\\'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4d_29vJlB4\\']The long-term trend of Bitcoin is extremely positive. I like to look at the 200 day moving average to filter out the daily noise.To maximize your profits from this long-term secular crypto-currency bull market you merely need to (1) hold onto your bitcoins, (2) restrict supply as much as you can (this is very important!) and (3) make any of these newcomers, like the VCs and Wall Street sharks, pay extremely dearly for whatever trickle of bitcoins you do choose to spend.\nNotice I said spend, like buying a new Porsche or one of 500,000+ products from the Bitcoin Store, and not sell as in like USD, EUR, etc.\nCurrently, there over 14,500 people waiting for MtGox verification of their trading accounts and if they are looking to use Bitcoin as a transactional currency for purchases from BitSpend or Silk Road then the price is irrelevant to them. And then we have a ton of Silicon Valley VCs and Wall Streeters fighting over each other to establish multi-million dollar positions. But that amount of capital is going to look tiny compared to what is scheduled in about six months.\nThere are only about 80,000 bitcoins of 'float' on a daily basis. Remember, prices are set at the margin. Simplistically and only for an example in aggregate, this means that if there is a positive funds flow into bitcoins of about a mere $4m then it will move the price by about $50. So, obviously, if there are any large blocks of bitcoins, 'walls', are gobbled up extremely quickly by this hot money from VCs and Wall Streeters. If that float can be reduced from 80,000 to 40,000 then the same $4m will move the price $100. That means VCs and Wall Streeters will have to pay more dearly to get any bitcoins. Squeeze them for all they are worth!\nAnd if you start acquiring bitcoins on a regular basis, as a service provider or merchant and are using a service like Bitpay then increase the percentage you hold as bitcoins or you can regularly buy bitcoins with a percentage of your paycheck to further dry up any other supply.\nSolution: Remove the walls and dry up any other supply of bitcoins.\nCONCLUSION\nYou know what's cool? A $150 per bitcoin? No, a $1m per bitcoin. It may take a decade to get there but the fiat currency market coupled with fractional reserve banking is the largest bubble in the world and since the Great Credit Contraction has started along with Bitcoin being a censorship-resistant honey badger of a currency it just may eat these bankster cobras.\nAfter all, the Bitcoin market, at current prices, is simply far far too small or these amounts of fund flows and is the key reason why the VCs and Wall Streeters are melting up the price by buying any bitcoins that appear for sale. Plus, saving bitcoins is where the virtuous cycle begins.And for those who think there is a massive Bitcoin bubble. The last bubble went from $0.05 to about $32 and unlike so many who are calling this a bubble, I know what it felt like back then because I was there. For a comparable move the bitcoin price would need to move from about $5 to around $3,200, a 20x rise from current prices, and we are only about 5% up this 'wall of worry'. We are playing this game for financial keeps: youtube=\\'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPxDoFbsvWA\\']\n\nTARGET ACQUIRED: TARGET LOCKED\n\n\n',)", "year": 2013, "month": 4, "day": 7}

Many people must partake to create the change we want to see.\nBitcoin has come a long way since its introduction in 2009, and we are currently in mainstream media almost daily. Both the American and Canadian Senates are investigating our beloved virtual currency. However, we still have a long way to go to dispel the myth that many people hold that Bitcoin is an underground currency used to buy and sell drugs, or is not financially viable.\nThe key in efficiently and effectively increasing adoption is in numbers. The more people we can reach at once with factual and accessible information, the faster adoption grows. I will call this Expedient Adoption. There\u2019s no doubt about this: those who hate bitcoin simply do not understand it. Those who do understand it tend to love it. Some of us even drop everything in our lives for it. The key is understanding, one person at a time.\nBut won\u2019t that take a long time? Each one of us talking to 1 or 2 people a day? I suppose it\u2019s like network marketing: there\u2019s power in numbers and introductions. Still. There must be a better way besides our valiant word-of-mouth efforts that often result in us being dismissed as \u201ccrazy\u201d or \u201con something.\u201d\nHow do we encourage adoption without involving the very parties that reach the masses using media, but depend on \u2018if it bleeds, it leads\u2019 tactics to keep them distracted and entertained?\nI may have just uncovered one of the best ways of Expedient Adoption. This method touches people all around using the internet. It is accessible and educational \u2013 and fun! And, the best part is, it gives those who watch and participate in the process free bitcoin. Yes. Free bitcoin. Free.\n\nOh, did I mention that it\u2019s also fun? Is there any better way of encouraging adoption than making it fun and profitable?\nI\u2019m speaking about Take My Bitcoins!, an online 1970\u2019s game show-style web broadcast that explores bitcoin in an uncomplicated way. It is available for anyone with internet access, anywhere in the world, to watch, at any time.\nMike Rotman is the mastermind behind Streamin\u2019 Garage:a company that literally began with a few cameras, a garage, a great team of people with a lot of faith and an idea \u2014 create excellent online shows. After discussing bitcoin with a few friends in an online Facebook community, Mike and his team had a collective lightbulb moment: \u201cintroduce people to bitcoin, and let them have fun with it.\u201d His goal with the show is to \u201cbring bitcoin to the masses.\u201d\nShow Off\nHere\u2019s the really fun part, in my slightly nerdy point of view: Take My Bitcoins shows the mining of bitcoins in the week leading up to the show. There is literally a camera on this mining equipment 24/7. I know it\u2019s like watching a cage at a zoo with a panda bear in it that never appears, because nothing active really happens, but the fact that I can pull this up online and show someone real-life mining is pretty neat. It certainly helps with explaining the mining part.\nAt the end of the week, one lucky participant who guesses the number of bitcoin mined by the machines will win bitcoin. \u201cWe cut [the mining] off 3 hours before show time, so guests have that amount of time to guess how many bitcoins the show has mined,\u201d Jeff Ownby, of Butterfly Labs, explains. However, bitcoin can be won in many ways, including answering simple questions about the currency and protocol. So, people are winning, having fun and learning about bitcoin.\nMike has a strong background in television production, direction and writing, having written for major network shows. He left the television industry 5 years ago to focus on internet production and content, \u201cespecially live,\u201d he explains. \u201c[Streamin\u2019Garage] live streams a lot of different events. We were the first mulit-camera live HD network on the web and want to continue to find new ways to break ground in live.\u201d\nThe Techie Side\nTake My Bitcoins! is no small endeavour. If you watch the show, you will see that the quality is incredibly high. Make no mistake, Mike\u2019s team clocks hundreds of hours a week in hard work to produce this entertainment for us. \u201cIt is a lot of work,\u201d Mike explains. \u201cFrom the production side, we are using a NewTek Tricaster 860, we built an entire set for the show, we have lighting, a 5-camera HD studio, and we employ 8 crewpeople.\u201d\nTechnically, the show runs a live chat room during its broadcast, where staff ask the audience questions: \u201cThose who play along [and have an answer] are called on their phone, so it\u2019s really a live, interactive game,\u201d Mike explains. \u201cWe are working with a global audience, and people\u2019s internet runs at different speeds. Some people can be 20 seconds behind, 2 minutes behind due to a bad internet connection. It\u2019s a live show, similar to a radio game, so we call them and connect with them live.\u201d The show itself is based on a radio-model, incorporating fun, play-along games, which can be played via cell phone. The show also incorporates social-media games, like #TakeMyMeme and a \u201cGuess How Much We Mine!\u201d game. \u201cWhen we first came up with the concept, it was very \u2018Price-Is-Right\u2019 meets \u2018Let\u2019s Make A Deal!\u2019\u201d\nThe show really does give away everything Butterfly Labs mines that week: \u201cThe game doesn\u2019t stop until our wallet is empty,\u201d Mike laughs. \u201cEveryone can see us mining, they can see all the transactions we do. Like bitcoin, it\u2019s all very transparent. You can see our wallets are full, you can see that they\u2019re empty. That\u2019s part of the whole process.\u201d\nWinners will send in W-9 paperwork if American and W8-BEN if international so they comply with American federal tax law. \u201cOur tax accountants had no idea what to do with this,\u201d Mike laughs. \u201cWe want to cover ourselves. In the end, we are giving away currency, so we treat it like that. It makes the process and the currency legitimate and safe.\u201d The team is very set on being transparent and upfront with the process. \u201cThe more legitimate it feels, the better everyone feels about bitcoin.\u201d\nSo, why bitcoin? \u201cIt seemed like a perfect fit, because it\u2019s decentralized and accessible around the world. It just makes sense that everyone [with internet access] can be involved in this,\u201d Mike continues. Going back to Butterfly Labs, showing everyone the mining equipment during the week, leading up to the airing, adds to the transparency of the show. \u201cWe\u2019re on camera; you can see the systems the show is using,\u201d Jeff adds.\nBitcoiners Doing What Bitcoiners Do\nOur community is unique in that we are incredibly supportive and helpful without expecting anything in return. We always seem to be dedicated to adoption. \u201cIt\u2019s great how supportive the bitcoin community is,\u201d Mike says. \u201cIt\u2019s really cool to watch the adoption happen, too. We had a winner last week, and she had no idea what it meant to win bitcoin. She said, \u2018what do I do?\u2019\u201d The team walked her through the process of setting up a wallet, and explained how and where to spend her bitcoin. We have people who say, \u2018I would play, but I can\u2019t pay my rent with it.\u2019 We say, \u2018Well, technically\u2026 you can.\u201d\nThe show\u2019s target audience is anyone who is interested in bitcoin, but they tend to attract a \u201cbright\u201d audience with their \u201csnarky and smart\u201d entertainment: \u201cWe definitely want the bitcoin audience, and they do tell us we need to ask more bitcoin questions, but we don\u2019t want to alienate. The point of this is to introduce bitcoin to everyone,\u201d Mike clarifies.\n\u201cWe are all from the bitcoin community,\u201d Jeff adds. \u201cIt\u2019s just a natural progression for us to target that market first, then take it from there. The idea is to get different guest hosts in every week, some from inside the industry, some from without.\u201d The show\u2019s modus operandi is to feature popular hosts, who can then introduce their own fan-base to bitcoin. Samm Levine, (shown far left) of Freaks and Geeks and Inglorious Basterds fame hosted the show last week. After appearing, he was enthused about the currency: \u201cHow do I get this! Send me some! How do I use this!?\u201d Alex Albrechtappeared on the last segment of the show to introduce bitcoin to his large (over 80 thousand Twitter followers!) fan base. Illeana Douglas is also scheduled to appear. However, the show also intends to include \u201cbitcoin luminaries\u201d and \u201cknown bitcoin people\u201d to help explain the more technical side as the audience plays along.\nAs I explained in an earlier article, the key to adoption is through clarity of purpose, legitimacy and cooperation. New adopters are already scared of bitcoin based on the negative media the currency has received, so businesses must embrace these values if they want to positively influence bitcoin use. Mike and Jeff show these values in their business practices.\nTake My Bitcoins! is building a strong audience base with their weekly shows. The producers are pleased with the word-of-mouth advertising they have been receiving, especially from the bitcoin community itself. After all, it is much easier to send someone to a fun game where they can win money than continuously beating your head against a wall explaining bitcoin to your inner circle. Sometimes, seeing it and hearing it from a third party is the tipping edge for them. As Mike says, \u201cthe best way to get bitcoin out there is to give it away.\u201d\nThe bitcoin community can also help by giving honest feedback to \u201chelp frame the game.\u201d The show is active on Twitter and very responsive. You can message them with your thoughts here.\nPurpose-Driven Production\nBoth Mike of Streamin\u2019 Garage and Jeff of Butterfly Labs see bitcoin as a world-changing phenomenon. \u201cI have been with Butterfly Labs since the beginning, but to be honest, the turnaround for me that made bitcoin into something bigger than it had been previously was my trip to New York City last year. I was leaving the conference in a cab, going back to my hotel, and my cab driver asked me, \u2018What is bitcoin?\u2019 I explained it to him, and he said, \u2018So I can send this to my brother in Pakistan?\u2019 And that changed everything for me. I realized how truly powerful this can be. I picture this taking over Western Union, and banks, and everything else. I see this now from a social justice perspective.\u201d\nMike is no different: \u201cIt started off as a fun chat on investments on Facebook, but then I realized that we had the power to give away currency that everyone\u2026anyone in the world can use. We always had a big international following with our show \u201cStupid For Movies\u201d but this is even bigger. We have people calling in from Saudi Arabia, Japan, Israel, and now we can give them something back, rather than just content. This is a worldwide currency. We will evolve in the future to give away bitcoin to charities such as animal shelters, Autism and other good projects. We give back. We want to do good.\u201d\nA Bit of Fun\nThe show is ultimately transcending multiple boundaries by showing us what is really possible on the internet in terms of interaction, production quality and content. Their team are all dedicated to the cause and even take their entire pay in bitcoin.\n\u201cStreamin\u2019 Garage really started as something small, and it grew because of a group of people who really believed in it.\u201d And that sounds a lot like something else we all know and love.\nThis is a really great way to get people involved in bitcoin. Watching role models they know and follow interacting with and giving away bitcoin is a huge step towards bitcoin adoption. People relate to what they know. Part of what makes bitcoin so scary is that it is not understood. But we feel like we know celebrities. They are familiar to us. Combining celebrities with bitcoin is genius. Mike has done it again. The show has aired only twice, and will be running weekly.\nSo, Bitcoin, let the fun and games begin!\nBitcoiners, you can help encourage adoption. You and your network can tune in every Thursday at 8:00 PM (PT) to watch Take My Bitcoins live! Missed an episode? No worries. Catch re-runs on their site, too! Show everyone how accessible and fun bitcoin can be.\nDisclaimer: I have not been compensated byButterfly LabsorTake My Bitcoins!or any related party in any way for writing this review/article. I am simply a woman who loves bitcoin and wants to see it adopted by everyone, and I think this is a great way of introducing bitcoin to people in a fun way.\n", "year": 2013, "month": 3, "day": 29}

Currently, every time a customer makes a payment with a credit card, merchants are charged about $0.25 + 2.9% for the transaction, and for many years, major credit card companies have included a term in their merchant agreements forbidding merchants from using surcharges or discounts to encourage their customers to pay with cash instead. The result has been what antitrust theorists would call a market failure: credit card companies encourage their customers to use credit cards through appeals to convenience, a consumer-biased chargeback system, and, in many cases, credit card companies bribe users directly with a 1% rebate on all purchases, while merchants are forced to cover the cost \u2013 or, more precisely, pass on the cost to all their customers, cash, debit and credit card users alike.\nPowerful retail business organizations have been bringing antitrust lawsuits against Visa and Mastercard for this practice since 2005, and a settlement on the matter was finally reached last year in June. The deal includes monetary compensation of $6.05 billion to a wide array of large and small businesses, an agreement to cut transaction fees by 10 basis points (ie. to 2.8%) for eight months (an estimated further $1.1 billion in savings for merchants), and, most importantly, the nullification of the clause preventing merchants from providing incentives for using alternative means of payment. Some merchants are unhappy with the deal, believing they could have gotten much more in a trial, but in November, the settlement received initial approval by a federal judge, and tomorrow the main part of the deal will kick in.\nIf merchants succeed in convincing consumers to pay more often with cash, the benefits in the retail industry will be significant. Although 2.9% may not sound like much, in many industries, businesses\u2019 profit margins are not even three times that, so having more customers use a more efficient method of payment will be a significant boon. Restaurants in particular may benefit, as profit margins for them are often as low as 4%.\nIn the case of online businesses, this significantly widens the door for Bitcoin adoption. Online businesses have to deal with not just fees, but also a significant amount of chargeback fraud. The issue is not a problem in all industries; according to a 2012 report by Cybersource, the average online merchant currently loses about 1% of their revenue to fraud, about 40% of which consists of fraudulent chargebacks. In the case of international payments, however, the loss rate is 2%, and some specific industries report loss rates that are even higher; one study in the manufacturing industry showed loss rates of 2-10%. If it becomes accepted for online merchants in these industries to accept Bitcoin as well, and, importantly, offer half of their savings to the customer as a discount, momentum for the currency may build up quickly. The Bitcoin Store already manages to offer customers electronics at prices significantly cheaper than major retailers like Amazon and NewEgg, largely due to the increased efficiency of Bitcoin with regard to fees, chargebacks and convenience, and with this settlement, passing on one\u2019s savings by using Bitcoin will no longer be an either-or proposition; established merchants who would benefit from their customers paying with Bitcoin will be free to offer both methods of payment, with the advantages and disadvantages of each properly factored into the price, at the same time.\nThe outcome of the settlement is not going to transform the payments industry overnight; merchant agreements of the type Visa and Mastercard were requiring were already illegal in ten states, and the experience there has shown that antitrust rules alone are not enough to significantly disrupt the credit card oligopoly \u2013 the responsibility ultimately falls on the competition to present something significantly better. Payments technology may well continue to advance slowly for years to come, and Bitcoin exchanges still have a long way to go to before the currency can realize its potential in the mainstream retail industry. However, both for Bitcoin and for any other startups seeking to displace Visa and MasterCard, this decision is nevertheless a significant step forward.", "year": 2013, "month": 1, "day": 27}

The show, which will air at 7:00 PM GMT (that\u2019s 2:00 on the US East Coast or 11:00 on the West Coast), will feature a live Google+ hangout including two guest speakers, both of whom are known in the Bitcoin community: lead developer Gavin Andresen, and Icelandic parliamentarian and Wikileaks supporter Birgitta Jonsdottir. Gavin Andresen is well-known for his role as lead developer of the Satoshi client and the Bitcoin protocol, and Birgitta Jonsdottir appeared in the London Bitcoin conference in 2012, where she gave a talk entitled \u201cNo Privacy \u2013 No Freedom\u201c.\nAlthough the message of Occupy Wall Street was difficult to define,\u201d Truthloader host Phil Harper states in the introductory video. \u201cIt seemed clear that it was a repsonse to people feeling left out of the political decision-making process.\u201d Harper then continues \u201cthe internet gave us a glimpse of a world with out the old systems of power. It\u2019s a place of creativity, engagment, and inclusion where people can feel like they are having an impact. Is it possible to use the open access principles to build a system thorugh which we can govern ourselves?\u201d It\u2019s a question which has been the focus of much discussion in the last few years; internet protests in 2012 were instrumental in blocking the Stop Online Piracy Act in the USA and the ACTA copyright treaty in Europe, and in 2010-2011 social media played a significant, and some even say crucial, role in the uprisings of the Arab Spring. Anonymous and the Pirate Party provide two more examples of political movements that have arisen entirely out of internet principles and culture. Bitcoin provides another way that a group of people can organize themselves online; here, a community hundreds of thousands of people strong has created, and enforced, an agreement on a common currency and a common monetary policy, all through bottom-up, decentralized cooperation.\nAlthough most of the time YouTube shows are too obscure to warrant mention, TruthLoader is somewhat of an exception. TruthLoader is operated by the British news service ITN (Indepdenent Television News), which is also responsible for ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 in the UK. TruthLoader\u2019s videos have been seen a total of about two million times; far from mainstream, but nevertheless significant. TruthLoader is als accepting questions from the community which it will ask the guest speakers; those who have something to ask can simply post their question on either #opengov on Google+ or Truthloader\u2019s Youtube channel. The event will be a unique opportunity to see Gavin Andresen speaking live, and another chance for Bitcoin users to interact wiht the larger internet activism community. For those who will not be able to watch it live, TruthLoader always posts its episodes on its Youtube channel. Either way, the event is important enough not to be missed.", "year": 2013, "month": 1, "day": 31}
{"title": "Bitpay Receives $510,000 From Investors", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitpay-receives-510000-from-investors-1357757414/", "birthday": "Jan 9, 2013  1:50 PM EST", "date": "2013-01-09 18:50:00", "content": "BitPay has announced that it has secured a funding round of $510,000 from outside investors. The investors include Barry Silbert, founder of SecondMarket, a trading platform used by institutional investors to exchange shares in companies that have not gone public; Jimmy Furland, also of SecondMarket; Shakil Khan, founder of the online music service Spotify; and the Bitcoin community\u2019s own Roger Ver, responsible for Memory Dealers and the Bitcoin Store, as well as others in the technology sector. BitPay is Bitcoin\u2019s leading payment processor, providing merchants with ready-made software tools that they can use to accept Bitcoin on their website or brick-and-mortar store, as well as an option that allows merchants to accept bitcoins without ever handling them themselves; instead, Bitpay automatically converts the bitcoins to the merchant\u2019s local currency and deposits into the merchant\u2019s bank account.\nBitPay is far from the first company to secure outside investment. The Bitcoin exchange MtGox was outright sold to Tibanne Co in March 2011, and within a year two more major Bitcoin businesses secured funding. BitInstant, a company that offers services that help make it easier and faster to buy bitcoins whether through bank transfer or cash deposit, secured an undisclosed sum in exchange for 15% of their company from Roger Ver in late 2011. In early 2012, Bitcoinica, the now defunct margin trading service that allowed users to buy or short bitcoins at high leverage, acquired an amount estimated to be in the low hundreds of thousands of dollars from an investor named Tihan Seale. Also, since May 2011 a number of small companies, mostly mining ventures but also notably SatoshiDice, have raised capital from a large number of mostly anonymous investors over trading platforms like the Global Bitcoin Stock Exchange and MPEX.\nMore interesting, however, is funding raised from established technology investors. In April 2012, Silicon Valley venture capital firm Draper Associates and Seattle angel investor Geoff Entress invested $500,000 in Coinlab, a company whose main projects so far have been an attempt to establish Bitcoin mining on gaming computers as an alternate way to pay for video games, and the Give-a-Goat charity mining software. In September, Coinbase, a company that has raised over $600000 from well-known investors including the \u201cseed accelerator\u201d Y Combinator and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. Now, this elite group of businesses has been joined by the largest payment processor in the Bitcoin economy, with over 2100 merchants (up from 1300 as recently as November) and $3 million in transactions over the course of last year.\nBitPay intends to use the money to move their headquarters to Atlanta and hire five new employees to work on developing new features for their platform. \u201cAtlanta is a great hub for financial technology companies,\u201d BitPay founder Tony Gallippi writes, \u201cOver 90 of them. It\u2019s a great place to recruit and retain top talent, plus tap into the banking and financial infrastructure there.\u201d Nearly 250,000 workers in the Atlanta Metropolitan Area work in finance-related occupations, out of a total population of 5.3 million, and 40,000 of them are employed specifically in the payment processing industry. Atlanta is also ranked by various indices to be among the top 40 financial hubs in the world. Thus, this decision will allow BitPay to tap into the talent of developers who are already familiar with payment processing issues, as well as give them the potential for much greater visibility in the payment processing community. BitPay\u2019s headquarters are currently headquartered in the much less impressive Orlando, Florida.\nGallippi writes that WordPress\u2019s decision to accept Bitcoin in November was a major factor pushing investors to support his company. Since WordPress started accepting Bitcoin (incidentally, using BitPay\u2019s platform to process payments), the company\u2019s merchant base has grown from 1,300 to over 2,100, and is expected to continue to grow as Bitcoin and BitPay receive more news coverage in the mainstream media. BitPay also currently has little in the way of direct competition. Coinbase, a company wishing to themselves become the \u201cPaypal of Bitcoin\u201c, does offer a merchant solution, but the core focus of their product is sending money person-to-person and creating an easy-to-use wallet service, so a marketing effort to attract merchants to themselves is unlikely. WalletBit is a more direct competitor, but so far their marketing efforts have focused heavily on Canada and Europe, while BitPay supports a more US-centric clientele. The distinction between the two can be clearly seen from their pricing policies; if a merchant wants their Bitcoin earnings automatically converted into local currency, BitPay offers a rate of 2.69% in the US and 3.99% in Canada, Mexico and the EU, while WalletBit offers a consistent 2.75% rate everywhere, although with a minimum fee of about $15 per transfer, soon to be reduced to about $5 in Canada.\nOf course, a significant number of merchants also build their own platform for accepting Bitcoin, an option which should not be discounted for large businesses or unique businesses that need to integrate Bitcoin in some way that extends beyond simply using it to accept payments, but in the market of average merchants looking to start accepting the currency, within the US BitPay enjoys a near-monopoly. In two years that may change, just like leading Bitcoin exchange MtGox has seen its market share slowly drop from over 90% at its peak in 2011 to about 67% now. For now, however, BitPay is comfortably well ahead of any competition, and still has a long way to go in attracting new merchants. 2012 saw the company go from almost nothing to over two thousand merchants. Ten thousand by the end of 2013 seems quite likely.", "year": 2013, "month": 1, "day": 9}
{"title": "Bitcoin Price Breaks $15.4 August 2012 High", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-price-breaks-15-4-august-2012-high-1358479963/", "birthday": "Jan 17, 2013  10:32 PM EST", "date": "2013-01-18 03:32:00", "content": "The Bitcoin price has just broken through the $15.4 high that it last set in August, making today\u2019s maximum of $15.68 at the time of this writing the highest that the Bitcoin price has been since July 6, 2011. The spike follows a roughly two-week-long rise that has been bringing the price up by an average of about 10 cents per day since roughly January 7, turning the rally into an all-out buying rush as the price battered for two hours, and finally broke through, the psychological barrier of $15. The near-term cause of the sudden increase was the Coming of Age Day, a banking holiday in Japan which caused deposits in the Japan-based MtGox to get delayed until today. Once the deposits processed on Tuesday, Fred Ehrsam argues, all those who deposited fiat into MtGox to buy bitcoins over the weekend were finally able to do so all at once, breaking the steady trendline at $14.2 and causing the price to shoot up precipitously over the next two days.\nUnlike some of the previous spikes that the Bitcoin price has seen over the years, this rally appears to be well supported by the underlying fundamentals. Google Trends volume, a commonly used statistic to gauge public interest in Bitcoin, is roughly stable, but over the past few months one can notice a distinct trend toward Bitcoin\u2019s score increasing. However, it should be noted that the Google Trends volume, although it used to be extremely well-correlated with the Bitcoin price, has diverged considerably in recent months, to the point of only slightly tracking Bitcoin price movements since August. Thus, there is reason to believe that the slow and unpredictable rate at which this statistic is rising should not be taken as an argument against Bitcoin\u2019s short-term and medium-term future.\nOther statistics weigh even more heavily in Bitcoin\u2019s favor. Here are some charts from blockchain.info showing the number of unique addresses and the number of transactions per day:\n\n\nThese figures, which attempt to measure Bitcoin\u2019s actual usage rather than public opinion or interest in the currency as search volume and all market statistics inevitably do, show the same pattern: the values rose during summer 2012, dropped off in the fall, but then began to quickly pick up again in November after WordPress started accepting the currency. Now, the values are all roughly at the same levels as their August 2012 highs, and are likely to go even higher.\nEven more positive are the statistics for the online wallet service operated by blockchain.info itself. The site\u2019s transaction volume and number of transactions per day have been consistently going up throughout 2012, even remaining roughly horizontal while the Bitcoin network statistics and price were going down in September and October. The number of users, however, is especially surprising:\n\nFor most of the year it was the simple, roughly quadratic curve that one might expect from a steadily growing service. In December, however, shortly after Bitcoin Centralannounced its deal with a payment services provider in France, a sudden and fundamental shift happened. For a few days, Blockchain\u2019s number of users very nearly went vertical, and it has since continued to grow at over twice the rate that it did previously.\nThe reasons for the rise are plenty. The price started to move up from a low of $10-$11 after WordPress, ranked by Alexa as the 21st most popular site in the world, started to accept Bitcoin for payment in November. Soon after that, we saw the Bitcoin Central deal take place, which significantly changed Bitcoin\u2019s reputation for the better in an instant. A flood of online articles on the subject arose, all with the same message: Bitcoin is now going mainstream. Since then, we have seen Bitcoin gambling hit the mainstream media, and articles continuing to report on Bitcoin as a whole, including an article by Canada\u2019s MacLeans which wrote in its headline that \u201cthe cold, hard cash of the Internet has seen dramatic growth recently, and shows no signs of slowing down.\u201d Bitcoin business is continuing to grow; BitPay\u2019s Tony Gallippi reports that since WordPress started to accept Bitcoin the company has increased its number of merchants by over 50% and now stands at over 2100. Very recently, the company also raised a sum of $510,000 from a number of moderately well-known Silicon Valley investors. The negative attention that Bitcoin had been receiving in the fall following the collapse of Pirateat40\u2019s Ponzi scheme and the Global Bitcoin Stock Exchange has since subsided, and Bitcoin has seen no significant troubles since. The currency is now in a better position to start truly hitting mainstream adoption that it ever was.\nFrom here, it is still a long road until Bitcoin breaks the all-time high of $31.91 that its price reached in June 2011. However, logarithmically speaking, Bitcoin has already covered nearly three quarters of the distance since its post-peak low of $1.994 in November 2011. The 14-day average is also now as high as it ever was, and may well go even higher. In the next few days, a return to the more steady trendline that is now in the $14-$15 range is likely, but if all goes well in the medium term that price is well poised to go even higher.", "year": 2013, "month": 1, "day": 18}

The two conferences will be in a similar format to those run in 2011 and 2012; they will both take up a weekend, feature a number of speakers making presentations on topics either related to Bitcoin or of interest to the Bitcoin community, as well as offer opportunities for speakers and attendees to interact; for the curious, schedules for the previous two conferences can be found here and here, and videos of individual presentations are also available from 2011 and 2012.\nThe 2012 conference, organized largely by Bitcoin activist Amir Taaki, saw a significant shift in the range of topics discussed from that in 2011, featuring many speakers who were outside of the Bitcoin community entirely; free software advocate Richard Stallman, the pro-free speech Icelandic Modern Media Initiative\u2019s Brigitta Jonsdottir, the free culture activist Jaromil and the leader of the 3D gun printing project Defense Distributed, Cody Wilson, were all among the speakers. A considerable number of Bitcoin developers and Bitcoin business owners, as well as others in the payments industry, but political activism was nevertheless a dominant message.\nThis time, the two conferences have radically different themes. For the 2013 conference in San Jose, the Bitcoin Foundation is pushing back in the direction of a conference organized around Bitcoin specifically and the more pragmatic issues that Bitcoin is trying to solve; the four main topics listed on the website are Bitcoin technology, Bitcoin mining, Bitcoin business and regulatory issues. Unfortunately, no list of speakers is yet given; the Bitcoin Foundation is still in the process of finding people to speak.\nThe unSYSTEM conference in Vienna, on the other hand, is pushing even further in the direction of activism. Of the sixteen speakers now listed on the site, only three are notable purely because of their work around Bitcoin, and the majority have nothing to do with the currency. Among these are Mitch Altman, inventor of the \u201cTV-B-Gone\u201d universal remote, free culture activist Nina Paley, democratic education pioneer Luis Henrique Fagundes and the Russian activist group Voina (\u201cWar\u201d). Richard Stallman, Brigitta Jonsdottir, Cody Wilson, Jaromil and Max Keiser, who were all present at the London Bitcoin conference in 2012, are back, as well as Amir Taaki, who is organizing the unSYSTEM conference as well. Amir Taaki is known for his work on Bitcoin development, but has also participated in more direct forms of political activism, including a recent high-profile event in which he and a number of other activistssquatted an exclusive property in central London. Also from the Bitcoin community Joerg Platzer, owner of Room77, the first restaurant to accept Bitcoin in Berlin, and now the leader of a project to get a large number of restaurants in Berlin to accept Bitcoin, will be attending.\nA particularly notable upcoming speaker is the Silk Road, a black market offering thousands of illegal drugs using Tor and Bitcoin for anonymity. The idea of an illegal organization speaking at an above-ground conference seems counter-intuitive, but it can be done. The Earth Liberation Front, an eco-terrorist group, has an above-ground \u201cpress office\u201d which is simply a media organization that reports on the ELF\u2019s activities. The Silk Road may similarly have a liaison, or perhaps they may choose to speak by videoconference; Taaki writes that Dread Pirate Roberts confirmed Silk Road\u2019s attendance, but details have not yet been decided.\nOn the whole, the split into two conferences is arguably a positive one for Bitcoin. There are many in the Bitcoin community who are intent on pursuing the success that Bitcoin reached at the end of 2012 with WordPress accepting Bitcoin and Bitcoin Central working with a licensed payment services provider in France, and attempting to get Bitcoin noticed, and accepted, by even more prominent individuals and organizations in the world of finance and payments. To many of them, associating Bitcoin with political radicalism, particularly the sort promoted by Cody Wilson and especially the Silk Road, serves only to marginalize the currency. Others, however, are political activists first and Bitcoin users second, and want to see more of what we saw in London in 2012. Almost certainly no one will agree with the entirety of what is spoken at the conference; opinion on controversial issues like guns and economic regulation vary widely even within the sort of community that unSYSTEM is seeking to attract, and some issues may even see both sides presented outright. However, as a meeting of minds the conference will be an event from which all sides can benefit by participating.\nPractical information on attending both conferences has been posted, for the San Jose conference here and the unSYSTEM conference here. Both conferences are expecting a larger number of attendees than either of the conferences that took place in 2011 and 2012, and meeting the faces behind the most popular projects and services in the Bitcoin community has always been a key attraction of these events. Everyone is encouraged to attend, and those who have something that they want to present should contact the Bitcoin foundation here or unSYSTEM at their email address. Hopefully, these two conferences will be the greatest Bitcoin conferences yet!", "year": 2013, "month": 1, "day": 11}

Ever since Butterfly Labs became the first company to publicly announce its upcoming ASIC technology in June 2012, four startup companies have been in a race to be the first to release the technology. Now, it looks like the race finally has a winner: Avalon. On January 19, the countdown timer which the company had boldly placed on its website weeks before has reached zero, and within hours, the company sent off its first batch of 300 mining rigs to its customers. The units are currently being shipped from China, and, Avalon founder Yifu Guo believes, units should start arriving at customers' doorsteps at the beginning of February.The specifications of the devices are somewhat less impressive than what Butterfly Labs has been promising. The most basic statistics, price and hashrate, are the same, with both companies offering 60 GH/s for $1,299. Going deeper into the features, though, there are significant differences. While Butterfly Labs' line of SC devices, with the exception of its 1500 GH/s \"Mini Rig\", is able to fit inside a ten-centimeter cube, one of Avalon's machines is as large as a typical desktop computer - a space inefficiency that the company was forced to pay dearly for with shipping costs of $150 per device. Compared to Butterfly Labs' promised power efficiency of 1.2 watts per GH/s, Avalon is offering 6W per GH/s - still nearly an order of magnitude of improvement over existing FPGA hardware, but nevertheless not nearly as efficient as what Butterfly Labs customers are expecting. Avalon's technical specifications are also generally inferior; Guo admits, for example, that Butterfly Labs' manufacturing process used a wavelength (a measure roughly comparable to the size of chip features) of 65nm, but Avalon used the relatively coarser 110nm.However, Avalon easily makes up for all of these deficiencies with one overwhelming advantage: so far, they are the only ones to have actually shipped a product. Avalon's main three competitors, ASICMiner, Butterfly Labs and bASIC, all originally promised shipping dates in October or November, but as of today, none of them have even demonstrated a functional product. ASICMiner is perhaps the closest to getting its machines working, but there is reason to believe that even it may be in worse shape than it appears. \"There are some oddities with their announcements,\" Guo explains. Normally, computer chip manufacturing facilities produce a \"yield\" of 95% - that is, less than 5% of the chips that come out of the foundry are imperfect in some way. For ASICMiner's chip production, the company's customer service representative reported, the number of failed chips is as high as 30%. In theory, all this means is that the manufacturer will need to make 43% more chips to compensate, but the abnormality hints at the possibility of other problems to come.ASICMiner has been relatively quiet about the reasons for most of their delays, although the latest - from mid-January to late March - was caused by a combination of internal business difficulties and Chinese New Year celebrations ensuring that work could not be completed in the weeks leading up to, and immediately after, the actual holiday that falls this year on February 10. Butterfly Labs has announced multiple significant delays, and is currently sticking to a timeline that will have it shipping the week of February 10. The most recent delay was caused by a decision to change the technology that it uses to connect its integrated circuits to the rest of the processor. Its original plan had been to use the Quad Flat No-leads package (QFN) technology, but heat management issues forced them to reconsider and switch to the Flip Chip Ball Grid Array (FCBGA), a change which is difficult to make at such a late stage in development.Avalon, on the other hand, has seen its development process go extremely smoothly, and has even come out far ahead of schedule compared to their original scheduled release date of late February 2013. Since then, they have mostly pushed their deadline forward, rather than back, with two small exceptions: a single one-week delay that the company were able to predict over a month in advance, and a largely unnoticed, one-hour, delay after the countdown timer expired on January 19. Ironically, the latter delay was caused by the exact opposite problem to what Butterfly Labs is facing: Avalon needed to remove some fans from its hardware because its cooling system was doing its job too well.Aside from basic statistics, Avalon has also made a number of other features of its devices public. The machines will run on openWRT, an open source Linux operating system, and the mining software itself is simply cgminer combined with an Avalon-specific driver. This also means that the Avalon code is entirely open source; openWRT is available under the General Public License version 2, and cgminer is released under GPL version 3. The machine uses a standard ATX power supply, the same as that used by ordinary computers, and internet connectivity is provided via Ethernet and Wi-Fi.Configuring the machine will be possible either through SSH or a dedicated web interface, allowing users to easily set it up to mine with their preferred mining pool. Solo mining, however, is harder. Unlike pooled mining, where the miner receives the block headers needed by the mining algorithm directly, a solo miner needs to have an instance of bitcoind running locally or connected to the machine, which also requires storing the entire 6 GB Bitcoin blockchain. There are two ways to get around the issue. First, one can run an instance of bitcoind on a separate PC and configure the Avalon machine to work with it just as easily as one would a mining pool. Alternatively, there is also the option of running bitcoind on the machine directly, but that would require a USB flash drive to store the blockchain, as well as some special configuration to make bitcoind available on openWRT. This second option, while attractive, is thus much more difficult to implement and not supported \u201cout of the box\u201d. Mining with P2Pool presents a similar problem, although in that case there is a third workaround: connect to a public P2Pool node rather than running a node yourself.Altogether, Avalon's first batch is expected to contribute a total of 18 TH/s to the Bitcoin network - about eighty percent of the network's entire hash power at the time of Avalon's shipping. The network hash power is expected to ramp up slowly over the coming weeks, giving at least some Avalon customers a small window of opportunity to quickly earn back a significant portion of their investment before the network difficulty adjusts - and before Avalon's competitors catch up. The company's next batch is expected to come with 500 units on March 1, although with prices increased to $1,499 per machine, and yet undisclosed future upgrades are already in the works.\n\nVitalik:\nYifu Guo:\nVitalik Buterin:\nYifu Guo:\nVitalik Buterin:\nYifu Guo:\nVitalik Buterin:\nYifu Guo:\nVitalik Buterin:\nYifu Guo:\nVitalik Buterin:\nYifu Guo:\nVitalik Buterin:\nYifu Guo:\nVitalik Buterin:\nYifu Guo:", "year": 2013, "month": 1, "day": 23}
{"title": "ASIC Mining Updates: bASIC Hanging On a Thread, Butterfly Delayed to February", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/asic-mining-updates-basic-hanging-on-a-thread-butterfly-delayed-to-february-1358303755/", "birthday": "Jan 15, 2013  9:35 PM EST", "date": "2013-01-16 02:35:00", "content": "Update: rumors of bASIC\u2019s demise have been, at least for now, grossly exaggerated.\nUpdates on the Bitcoin ASIC mining scene are coming faster and faster as the shipping dates for all three leading contenders approach. Only a few days ago, all major competitors were poised to release their products around January 19, and it looked as though the eight month long wait for the new mining technology would finally draw to a close. Now, however, it appears that most of us will have to wait a little longer.\nThe first troubling news came on Saturday when Dave, manager of the bASIC project\u2019s parent company BTCFPGA, announced that the project was on the brink of collapse, and was processing refunds. BTCFPGA has been in trouble for over a week; on January 5, another BTCFPGA employee who goes by Tom, or \u201ccablepair\u201d on the company forums, announced on the BTCFPGA forums that shipping would be delayed considerably due to Chinese New Year celebrations in China. In 2013, the date for the Chinese New Year will be February 10, and factories typically close for a week on both sides of the holiday (or two weeks total), allowing for celebrations similar to Thanksgiving and Christmas, but more prolonged since Chinese factory workers often live far away from home and need days to get back. However, the consequences to businesses relying on China as part of their supply chain extend far beyond this. Raw materials suppliers often shut down weeks prior to the main celebration to anticipate the reduction in demand, and after the celebrations production also picks up very slowly. Many employees take extra vacation time right after the holidays for Chinese New Year \u2013 a sensible decision, as they live so far away from home and taking multiple shorter breaks would not allow them to see their families. At many factories, the situation is even worse: up to 50% of the workers do not return to their jobs at all. Thus, factories start off the new year understaffed, at a time when they need to be the busiest bringing production back on track.\nOn January 8, BTCFPGA customers received another message in which Tom announced the \u201cfinal \u2013 never again changing date for bASIC shipment:\u201d March 15-29. The next day, Dave announced that \u201cthere are new player(s) that have come to the fore pledging to support this project \u2013 this may come as a complete buyout or by taking a cash equity position \u2013 the details are being hammered out over the next day or two.\u201d He also confirmed that under the new deal the March 15-29 shipping date would be on schedule. On January 12, however, Dave made a post stating that the deal was off. On January 15, however, Dave provided some good news: bASIC was still alive, and Tom was working hard on a deal that would ensure that the company keeps going. \u201cTom sounded very upbeat and motivated to see bASIC placed in the hands of a team that can carry it forward to complete his original vision.\u201d Dave wrote.\nOn Monday, Butterfly Labs, facing accusations of what some consider to be evasive behavior, have come out and announced a specific deadline: the week of February 10. The date comes as a shock to some, particularly as as little as one week before today many people expected Butterfly Labs to deliver slightly ahead of Avalon\u2019s preset deadline, January 19. However, Butterfly Labs\u2019 Josh Zerlan has written a post extensively describing the reasons behind the delay, and precisely what the company still needs to do over the next few weeks. The main cause of the delay is a decision that the company made to switch the technology that it uses to connect its integrated circuits to the rest of the processor. Its first decision had been to use the \u201cQuad-Flat No-leads package\u201d (QFN) technology, but later tests showed that with QFN the chips were getting uncomfortably hot. \u201cOur chips would have functioned as currently spec\u2019d within our thermal tolerances, Zerlan writes, \u201cbut we would have very little thermal headroom to really crank things up. With an eye towards the future, we decided to bite the bullet and release a product that is ready for the long haul as opposed to releasing something now that would require exotic cooling to be pushed past 80 GH/s or so.\u201d The perfectionist attitude runs deep within the company; even the ASIC team\u2019s payment, Zerlan writes, is \u201ceffectively tied to the success of the chip\u201d \u2013 not the release date. They are now instead using a \u201cflip chip ball grid array\u201d (FCBGA).\nThe outline of Butterfly\u2019s plans in the weeks to come is as follows. This week, the company will travel to the packaging facility for a final preparation and walkthrough, and confirm travel plans to the fabrication facility. Next week, preparation for final assembly will take place and the team will make its way over to the fab. On the week starting Jan 27, final chips will roll off the production line and manufacturing will start for the units themselves. On the week starting Feb 3, the chips will be packaged and everything will be assembled. Finally, on the week of Feb 10, Zerlan writes, \u201cwe descend upon the Post Office, DHL, UPS and FedEx like a horde of angry locust.\u201d\nIn the meantime, ASICMiner appears to have been delayed only slightly compared to its prognoses from weeks ago; in an update on January 10, ASICMiner announced that they had already placed the necessary mass production orders, and so they are expected to turn on their devices relatively soon. They are also helped by the fact that their business model is different from the others, relying on keeping their machines in-house and earning money through a combination of raising shares and pocketing the mining revenues themselves, so they do not need to bother with shipping and can get away with somewhat less sturdy hardware. Avalon\u2018s Yifu Guo, on the other hand, confirms that shipping is still on track for January 19.\nIf all goes according to plan from here, some customers will be turning on their ASICs as early as next week, and will have two weeks of unexpectedly high revenue as without competition Avalon and ASICMiner\u2019s machines will be able to collect a large fraction of the fixed Bitcoin mining reward. Also in Avalon customers\u2019 favor is the fact that mining difficulty will take a while to adjust. Their first batch will contain 300 machines, each of which are capable of 60 GH/s, sending the network hashrate from about 21 TH/s to nearly 40 TH/s. The next difficulty target is estimated to take place on block 217728, almost exactly at the time that many customers will be receiving their Avalon ASICs, so the first time mining difficulty significantly moves up to reflect the network\u2019s newfound strength will only happen in early February. Butterfly Labs will, unfortunately, miss the golden opportunity, and buyers of bASICs will have to wait even longer is they choose to spend their refunds on a competitor\u2019s product. Regardless, however, it is becoming clear that every day we are getting closer to the pinnacle of Bitcoin mining coming right to our desktops.", "year": 2013, "month": 1, "day": 16}

Even after Avalon announced that they had shipped their ASICs out to customers one and a half weeks ago, many continued to doubt Avalon\u2019s claims, but now the Bitcoin community can finally rest easy knowing that the long-awaited ASICs are indeed real.\nWord from Garzik first came out a few hours ago, when he wrote a blog post confirming that he received the package and showing off a few pictures of the device and its packaging. An hour later Garzik followed up with another post, detailing the hardware\u2019s modularity and providing a brief three sentence hardware review: \u201cNo wifi antenna included. No paperwork or instructions. Power cable is for Chinese \u201cI-SHENG\u201d power outlets, not American. Easy oversights if someone is rushing to ship it, I suppose :)\u201d Fortunately, Avalon founder Yifu Guo confirms, the rest of Avalon\u2019s customers will get a standard US power cable as expected.\nNow, only several minutes ago, Garzik followed up with a message on Bitcoin IRC announcing the news that Bitcoin enthusiasts everywhere have all been waiting for: \u201cmining!\u201d, soon followed by a statistic: the machine\u2019s average hashrate is 68252.65 MH/s. This is about thirteen percent higher than the 60 GH/s that Avalon had originally promised, and with the state of the Bitcoin network as it currently is is no small sum; given the current total network hashrate of 22000 GH/s, Garzik will be able to earn an average of about $240 per day. Avalon\u2019s remaining customers will also be able to enjoy highly lucrative rewards, although not quite as extreme; once all of Avalon\u2019s 20 TH/s are added into the picture, each individual ASIC will earn about $120 per day (paying for itself in slightly under two weeks), although revenues will decrease further when Butterfly Labs\u2019 customers get their hands on their own ASICs \u2013 an event which, given Butterfly Labs\u2019 current shipping projections is likely to occur around the beginning of March.\nGarzik has also made additional comments on the machine\u2019s functionality; \u201conce mining started it was very loud,\u201d Garzik writes, \u201cfans full blast, when initially powered on. The the fans flow down, and the noise cuts way down.\u201d He also spoke positively about the web interface, and for mining aficionados posted a detailed cgminer output log at http://pastebin.com/g4BhvCXK.\nASIC mining will likely take months to reach its full potential; Avalon is not releasing its next batch until early March, and Avalon and Butterfly Labs may well be working nonstop for the foreseeable future as more and more customers line up to buy their own.

The recent launch of Coinbase Exchange will change Bitcoin no less spectacularly. If you need further evidence, compare the early user growth rates of AOL with those of Coinbase. Coinbase adoption rates are significantly outpacing those that AOL made history with back in the early 1990s.\nHere\u2019s how and why.\nSince Bitcoin growth rates seem to be stagnating compared to their 2013-2014 highs, most of us are accustomed now to leadership and innovation in the industry coming from the heavily venture-backed companies. From the standpoint of a VC, the space has matured over the past year from a field of slim pickings to one filled with heavyweights such as Coinbase, BitPay, Circle, BitGo, ChangeTip, BitFury, Chain, BitNet, OkCoin, Blockchain and many more. Amazing teams, amazing businesses, incredible growth trajectory and promise. If you haven\u2019t been watching closely, you may have missed this transformation.\nThe recent news of Coinbase\u2019s $75 million series C and the fruit of their labor, the Coinbase Exchange, was well publicized. However, few took note of the company\u2019s rollout of fiat-backed accounts. On a pragmatic level, this means you can now sell your bitcoin and hold local currency with Coinbase. Individually these announcements are exciting, but in unison they represent a game changer. Bitcoin, beyond its philosophical or technological promise, has finally gained legal utility.\nLet me lay this out for you in more detail.\nCoinbase just used its Bitcoin foundation to become the world\u2019s first global bank. Let that sink in. Sure, there are international banks, but operationally these banks function more as group of allied national banks who share a brand. That is not the same thing as a global bank. A customer in Greece, for example, who opens an account with Coinbase, is now doing business directly with a U.S.-based \u2018bank.\u2019\nThanks to Coinbase\u2019s $75 million funding round provided by the NYSE, large U.S. banks, a multinational telecom company and a roster of finance VIPs, you can now open an account in a country such as Poland or Greece, fund your account via bitcoin or wire, and hold your money in U.S. dollars in the comparatively stable U.S.A. Your money is now completely insulated from your local currency issues, but spends the same as euros in your local bank account. This is the best of both worlds: all the functionality of your existing bank (and more), without the associated risks and fees. In addition to the banking services, Coinbase has just created the easiest, cheapest, least corrupt and most secure way to buy dollars. I imagine we\u2019ll see an increasing number of local currencies you can hold in your account, too.\nThis week has seen an additional series of important announcements from Coinbase. On February 10, the company announced that it has expanded its bitcoin buy-and-sell functionality to five additional countries: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Norway and Croatia. This brings the total number of countries where Coinbase\u2019s buy-and-sell features are available to 24, with its wallet functionality available in 166 others.\nAll Coinbase needs now is a debit card and they could complete the circle. What if Coinbase gets shut down locally? If they were smart, they\u2019d shut down operations in that country and refund everyone their deposits in bitcoin. Let the customer unload it locally at a small discount. The result: risk-free dollars. Funded by the NYSE. And INSURED.\nIf you are an exchange, it is imperative that you start taking notes and start moving fast. Coinbase has created the world\u2019s first truly global bank, with features and low fees that a legacy bank is technically incapable of offering, unless they use Bitcoin.\nCongratulations are in order for Coinbase. This was no easy feat. But surely now, other financial institutions have taken note of BBVA and USAA involvement, and will be looking for their own play in the space. As soon as Coinbase turns on the marketing engine that brands it as a gateway for USD, Coinbase use will surge internationally and, by its nature, introduce those users to the world of Bitcoin. Consumers have a use case, businesses have a use case, and the best-performing venture investors are salivating. Now it\u2019s just a race to the first 10 million users.\n\u00a0", "year": 2013, "month": 2, "day": 13}

We have seen a number of news articles about Bitcoin from various mainstream media sources, nearly all of which have been positive, as well as reports of record-breaking revenues from Bitcoin businesses, increasing adoption and, last but not least, a rapid growth in the Bitcoin price. Over the past three months since WordPress started accepting Bitcoin for its premium services, the mood within the Bitcoin community has turned much more optimistic, and with good reason; many of the scams and scandals that had been holding Bitcoin back in 2012 are now well past us, and the currency\u2019s positive fundamentals are showing through ever more clearly. Many have predicted that 2013 would be a landmark year for Bitcoin, and so far, reports from all sides of the Bitcoin community show that these predictions have been spot on.\nBitcoin And Gambling\nThe popular Bitcoin dice game SatoshiDice announced record-breaking profits in the months of December and January, earning 17000 BTC and 20000 BTC ($340,000 and $400,000) in the past two months, respectively. S.DICE share prices on MPEX are now more than double the original IPO price.BitZino reported that in 2012, users cashed out a total of 28,986 BTC, bet a total of 664,192 BTC and earned the company 10,137 BTC in profits.An established name in the rapidly growing Bitcoin poker industry, Seals with Clubs, has reported total withdrawals of 110,587 BTC over the past sixteen months, and over 1,000 unique players in the months of December.Infiniti Poker announced that it is set to go live in February, offering Bitcoin as a deposit and withdrawal option.\nRise Of The ASICs\nAfter months of setbacks and delays on the part of all three of their major competitors, the Bitcoin ASIC manufacturing company Avalon became the first to ship the long-awaited hyper-efficient mining rigs on January 19.On January 31, Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik was the first to receive his shipment, and reported statistics that were every bit as impressive as Avalon promised: the desktop computer-sized, $1300, 400-watt machine achieved a hashrate of 67 GH/s, earning its owner over $200 per day until the remaining Avalon devices and later, those of their competitors, are turned on and the Bitcoin network difficulty adjusts to compensate.Butterfly Labs has announced what appears to be a final shipping schedule, with the last update showing a plan to ship them around February 18.BTCFPGA\u2019s bASIC project ran into further delays, exacerbated by the upcoming Chinese New Year celebrations, and internal organizational issues nearly collapsed the company, leading to a 90% refund rate and the project being sold to an obscure Canadian company known as \u201cCAN-ELECTRIC\u201d, under which the bASIC has now been rebranded as the \u201cEhasher\u201d\nMerchants And Business\nBitPay announced that it has reached a mileseone of 10,000 transactions since the company\u2019s inception, with over 2,400 merchants as of mid-January.BitPay also announced that it raised a sum of $510,000 from a number of Silicon Valley and Bitcoin investors, and will use the funds to hire more developers and move its operations to Atlanta, a city known for its burgeoning financial industry.Multiple major merchant service providers and Bitcoin exchanges announced incremental improvements to fees and availability. BitPay lowered its fee for international bank deposits to 2.99%, WalletBit expanded its bank deposit option to 42 countries, and Coinbase increased its buy and sell limits to 100 BTC and 1,000 BTC ($2,000 and $20,000) per day, respectively.\nWelcome To Bitcoin!\nBlink, a German magazine dedicated to libertarian politics, released a special issue dedicated to Bitcoin, and began accepting Bitcoin for both the special issue and its previous releases (releases 1-3 German only).The Gold Anti-Trust Action committee (GATA), a group dedicated to providing support for gold and silver investors and exposing market manipulation in the precious metals industry, announced that it began accepting donations in Bitcoin.The Icelandic Modern Media Initiative, an organization dedicated to digital democracy and freedoms of speech and information in Iceland, began accepting donations in Bitcoin.WrapBootstrap, a marketplace for premium themes based around the Twitter Bootstrap web development framework, began allowing customers to make purchases with Bitcoin, becoming the tenth most popular website in the world to accept Bitcoin.Open Source Ecology, a group dedicated to developing the Global Village Construction Set described as \u201can open source, low-cost, high performance technological platform that allows for the easy, DIY fabrication of the 50 different Industrial Machines that it takes to build a sustainable civilization with modern comforts.\u201d, also began accepting Bitcoin.\nOff The Charts\nBitcoin\u2019s price broke through the $15.4 high that the currency set in August 2012 and then surged past $20, leaving only about a single week in June 2011 during which the currency\u2019s price was ever higher than it is now.Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization reached a new all-time high of about $235 million, surpassing the peak of the currency\u2019s June 2011 spike by about four percent.The Google Trends volume spiked up suddenly to roughly the same level as its brief January and August 2012 peaks.The Blockchain.info wallet surpassed 100,000 users, and its daily transaction volume hit a massive new all-time high of 978,000 BTC.If expressed in USD, January 30 saw the highest MtGox USD trading volume in all of Bitcoin history.The number of transactions per day hit a new all-time high, as did the number of transactions excluding popular addresses, reaching 58834 and 23619, respectively.\nMiscellaneous\nExactly one year after MegaUpload was shut down with the cooperation of US and New Zealand authorities, Kim Dotcom released his new file hosting platform Mega to the public. However, pro-copyright group StopFileLockers quickly began a campaign working with PayPal to shut down Mega resellers\u2019 ability to receive payments through PayPal, successfully doing so to four out of ten resellers. Soon, one of the affected resellers, hosting.co.uk, began reselling Mega services through Bitcoin.Online Bitcoin information site Blockchain.info released a version of its popular online wallet service in the form of Firefox and Chrome extensions, making the wallet\u2019s security close to that provided by desktop applications.Emirates Airlines\u2018 Open Skies magazine published an article about Bitcoin in their January print edition.Bloomberg.com ran an article about Bitcoin on their website, entitled \u201cBitcoin\u2019s Gains May Fuel Central Bank Concerns\u201c\nFollowing two straight months of significant breakthroughs in November and December, the events that happened in January could hardly have been better. Now, more and more people are reporting that Bitcoin is entering the mainstream consciousness once again, and the conception that Bitcoin is a fad well past its time, so popular at the end of 2011 following the currency\u2019s steep 93% drop in price, is being beaten further and further back with every passing week. Now that what may well have been turn out to be the toughest period in Bitcoin\u2019s history is past, there is more and more reason to be optimistic and look to an ever brighter path onward.", "year": 2013, "month": 2, "day": 5}
{"title": "BitcoinWireless: Top Up Your Phone Plan with Bitcoins, At Or Below Cost", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoinwireless-top-up-your-phone-plan-with-bitcoins-at-or-below-cost-1360203075/", "birthday": "Feb 6, 2013  9:11 PM EST", "date": "2013-02-07 02:11:00", "content": "Update, Feb 14: many users have been reporting orders not fully processing or being unable to add their top-up credits to their account. Users are recommended to try the smallest possible denomination first, and then make the full order if the smaller transaction works\nToday a service which many have been awaiting for months has finally rolled out its soft launch, and is inviting members of the public to come and test it as the site enters its final stages of launch. BitcoinWireless is a service that allows anyone to purchase top-up credits for their phone for bitcoins, and currently works with over 280 carriers in 112 countries. Anyone with a phone using any of the carriers can simply go to the site, enter their country, carrier, email address and phone number, pay the bitcoins to a receiving address generated by the site, and receive an email containing their carrier\u2019s standard instructions for adding the credit to their plan within hours \u2013 quite often, within thirty minutes.\nMany Bitcoin entrepreneurs have attempted to create similar intermediary services for various industries in the past; you can already buy gift cards for BTC, Reddit gold for BTC and, recently, even order Domino\u2019s pizza for bitcoins with the help of third-party resellers. Bitcoin Wireless, however, is different, and for one simple reason: the prices at which they are selling are, in many countries, either at cost or even below cost, beating out even the prices set by carriers themselves. In the US, for example, buying a top-up credit with any phone plan will cost exactly $20 worth of BTC, no transaction fees attached. \u201cWe buy it at a discount,\u201d founder of BitcoinWireless\u2019 parent company, BitInstant, explains, \u201cand sell it at 1:1 for BTC\u201d. In Canada, the situation is especially favorable. For example, consider the $20 Wind Mobile topup. If one buys the topup directly from a local Wind Mobile store, or by credit card, once local sales taxes are added one pays a total price of $22.60. With Bitcoin Wireless? Converting the 0.89 BTC payment into CAD, $18.88. All of the other phone plans in Canada work similarly. That\u2019s right: if you have a mobile phone plan in Canada, you can buy a $20 topup credit for less than $20.\nBitcoin Wireless is not the first retail business to make such an offer; that honor, at least if one restricts attention to retail businesses, and excludes companies selling products that they create themselves, goes to the Bitcoin Store, which sells electronics for Bitcoin cheaper than Amazon and NewEgg. However, it is the second, and in Canada the price difference is large enough that it may well entice at least a small number of people to go through the process of buying BTC through Cavirtex or canadianbitcoins.com just to take advantage of the savings. In the US, Bitcoin Wireless is just as expensive as its alternatives in terms of money, but for those who already have BTC lying around Bitcoin payments are far more convenient in terms of time; all it takes is to scan the QR code with a smartphone app and hit \u201csend\u201d.\nUnfortunately, a lot of countries are still missing from the list. Nearly every country in Europe, for example, is nowhere to be found, and notably elsewhere in the world Argentina, China, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand are also missing, among others. Many other countries are available, but only at a high markup; in Russia, for example, Bitcoin Wireless sells at an exchange rate of 100 RUB for $4.5 USD, a 35% markup over the actual cost. \u201cWe\u2019re adding more countries,\u201d Shrem writes, \u201cbut, right now, Europe is hard.\u201d BitcoinWireless is adding more carriers every day, and so Europe will likely be added in the months to come. The web page itself is still under last-minute testing, although it is expected that everything will be finalized within a few days. Even while plans for Europe are still in the works, though, Bitcoin Wireless offers a great way for customers in the US especially to top up their phone plan, and in Canada Bitcoin Wireless can join the ranks of Bitcoin Store as a service that is actually cheaper in bitcoins.", "year": 2013, "month": 2, "day": 7}
{"title": "Introducing The Exchanges: BitStamp", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/introducing-the-exchanges-bitstamp-1360800096/", "birthday": "Feb 13, 2013  7:01 PM EST", "date": "2013-02-14 00:01:00", "content": "Disclaimer: BitStamp has previously run ads in an edition of the Bitcoin Magazine print edition. This article was written independently of this fact, and the author was not aware of the fact at the time of the article\u2019s writing\nBitcoin exchanges are one of the most important parts of the Bitcoin ecosystem. For those of us who are not lucky enough to have wealthy Bitcoin-owning friends or jobs paying in BTC, they provide a valuable service by making it possible for Bitcoin users to buy and sell bitcoins without finding someone to trade with on their own. For those who use Bitcoin as a way to buy ordinary products, such as electronics at the Bitcoin Store or prepaid cell phone topups at Bitcoin Wireless, cheaper than they can be found elsewhere, Bitcoin exchanges are what provide the necessary liquidity to make their savings possible.\nThere are a wide variety of Bitcoin exchanges available today, with a wide array of payment methods to choose from. However, many beginning Bitcoin users still find exchanges hard to use. Their concerns are justified; the two most popular online payment methods today, credit cards and PayPal, still cannot be used to buy bitcoins. There is a good reason for this; the chargeback mechanism inherent in these methods of payment makes it trivial to defraud a Bitcoin exchange that accepts them, but nevertheless the relative difficulty of alternative methods of payment remains a significant roadblock to many.\nOne of the largest Bitcoin exchanges today is called BitStamp. The exchange has been around for one and a half years, and has a trade volume of over $2 million USD per month \u2013 a far cry from leading exchange MtGox\u2019s $30 million per month, but larger than any other of its competitors. The exchange is particularly entrenched in its core European market, where MtGox is currently less prominent than it is in the US and elsewhere, although it allows bank deposits from anywhere around the world. Fees are relatively low, with a trade fee of 0.20-0.50%, compared to MtGox\u2019s trade fees of 0.25%-0.60%. The main deposit method is bank transfer, and deposits usually process within 24 hours.\nBitStamp\u2019s owner, Nejc Kodric, was first introduced to the Bitcoin community in March 2011, in the same way that so many others were: through mining. Kodric writes: \u201cBack then I owned a computer company \u2013 we sold components, laptops, etc. Damijan (a current business partner at Bitstamp) came to me and wanted to buy a mining rig. I knew he was an excellent programmer but I knew he didn\u2019t play that many videogames\u2026so I was curious why would he buy a PC with 2x 2core GPUs \u2013 I believe he got 6990s. So he briefly explained what Bitcoin is an what mining is, and about a day later I was already hooked. Not long after Damijan and I started planing on idea of an exchange.\u201d And so, in August 2011, BitStamp was born. The exchange started out small, not picking up any significant volume for its first eight months of operation, but in June 2012 Kodric met with two large buyers who started buying through the exchange \u2013 giving the exchange enough of a boost to start to get noticed and truly take off. Since then, growth has been massive.\nAlthough the exchange trades USD-BTC, its primary target is European users. When asked why he made such a counterintuitive choice, Kodric explains: \u201cThe simple answer would be, to concentrate liquidity. Back when we started operating, buying bitcoins in EU for USD was a hassle\u2026 you would have to wire to MtGox and pay large fees for a wire transfer, and EUR/BTC markets were way underdeveloped. So we figured it would be nice to provide a USD market for Europeans and to accept money at low fees. Many wanted to trade in USD and not EUR, so we introduced our free SEPA deposits with low conversion rates.\u201d BitStamp\u2019s conversion rates are indeed quite favorable, amounting to an effective fee of only about 0.3% in each direction. BitStamp is also planning on soon adding multi-currency support, allowing users to hold funds in USD, GBP, EUR and CHF (Swiss francs), which may further increase the exchange\u2019s efficiency.\nSEPA bank deposits are by far the most popular deposit mechanism for European users, and buying BTC with BitStamp through SEPA is a fairly simple process. The full process is as follows:\nLog in (or if needed create an account) at BitStamp, and click on the \u201cDeposit\u201d tab. Click on the EU Bank (SEPA) option on the left, and fill in the form containing your name, how much you want to deposit, and an optional comment.Click DEPOSIT. At that point you are given BitStamp\u2019s banking details, as well as an 11-digit \u201cmessage\u201d number which you must include with your bank deposit as a message in order to get credited.Copy down the bank information and make a bank transfer to that account for the amount that you entered in the BitStamp deposit form and containing the 11-digit number that you received in the message. Different banks have different instructions for this step; here are two examples of how the process works for particular banks.Wait up to 24 hours for the funds to get credited to your BitStamp account.Click on the \u201cBuy/Sell\u201d tab, and click \u201cBuy Bitcoins\u201d. Fill in the amount of USD you want to spend (which is probably your entire USD balance with BitStamp), and click the \u201cBUY BITCOINS\u201d button that appears at the bottom of the mini-form.Click on the \u201cWithdrawal\u201d tab, then the \u201cBitcoin\u201d option on the left, and paste in your Bitcoin address from your Bitcoin wallet, as well as the amount of BTC you want to withdraw (once again, probably all the BTC that you have available). Click \u201cWITHDRAW\u201d, and wait until your Bitcoin client confirms that you have received the transaction (you should get some kind of notification of an unconfirmed transaction within a minute).\nAnd that\u2019s it, enjoy your freshly bought bitcoins, and perhaps take a look at the various places you can spend them. The process for converting BTC to EUR is similar, although the SEPA step is somewhat different as it is now BitStamp that is making the transfer to your account. For international users, there is a minimum deposit fee of $15 per transfer and a 2-5 day waiting period, but the bulk of the process is essentially the same.\nBitStamp also prides itself on its security. Over 90% of client funds are stored in offline cold storage, rendering the exchange invulnerable to hacks of the sort that brought Bitcoinica down in 2012. BitStamp internally uses CentOS, an operating system closely based on the RedHat Enterprise Linux distribution which is also known for being used by the US military for its security. To protect users, BitStamp offers a two-factor authentication option with Google Authenticator, an iPhone and Android application that generates one-time passwords that need to be entered alongside your main password whenever BitStamp detects that you are not logging in from your usual computer.\nThe exchange has a number of future developments coming up for the next few months, although Kodric is not willing to reveal just what most of these upgrades are going to be until they are formally released. For now, BitStamp remains an exchange with one of the more spotless, even if not the most prominent, reputations in the Bitcoin community, with very few complaints about the sorts of deposit and withdrawal delays and anti-fraud and anti-money-laundering compliance hassles that are occasionally reported by users of MtGox and even Coinbase. As the European market for Bitcoin continues to grow, BitStamp looks like it has a very bright future ahead.", "year": 2013, "month": 2, "day": 14}

As Reddit describes it, \u201creddit gold adds shiny extra features to your account that are made possible thanks to support from people like you,\u201d including filtering specific subreddits, the ability to see more subreddits and comments per page, new comment highlighting, the ability to save comments, turn off ads, exclusive access to a \u201csuper-secret members-only community that may or may not exist\u201d and, last but not least, a trophy. There is also an option to \u201cgift\u201d Reddit Gold to someone else, which is often used as a way of rewarding particularly good posts \u2013 sort of like a more official version of Bitcointip.\nThe payment processor that Reddit has chosen to use is Coinbase, a service which also recently made headlines for passing a 30-day volume of $1 million with its trademark Bitcoin exchange service which allows users to buy and sell bitcoins directly from their bank account. Coinbase has now also introduced an array of merchant tools which allow anyone to easily integrate Bitcoin acceptance into their site at no charge (although Coinbase\u2019s standard 1% fee does apply if the merchant wishes to have the bitcoins automatically converted into USD).\nThe news came unexpectedly, as although the Bitcoin community did make repeated requests for Reddit to accept Bitcoin for their paid service in 2012, since December it seemed as though the cause was, at least for the time being, hopeless and the community\u2019s requests have since died down. Now, it turns out that Reddit was in fact listening to the Bitcoin community\u2019s requests all along, and their Bitcoin acceptance platform has now finally been unveiled. According to Alexa, Reddit is the 135th most visited site in the world, putting it as the second most prominent Bitcoin acceptor after WordPress, which comes in 22nd, and ahead of the Internet Archive, which places 232nd. This also introduces the new largest company to have dealings with Bitcoin through its subsidiaries: Advance Publications, with a revenue of $7.63 billion, taking over from Wuala\u2018s parent company LaCie, with a revenue of $500 billion. For Bitcoin, this comes as yet another great step forward. In 2011, nearly all serious businesses stayed away from Bitcoin, particularly wary of the reputation that the currency had during its fledgling days. Now, with every passing month larger and larger businesses are becoming willing to accept it. In November, WordPress. Now, Reddit. Given how secretive Reddit has been with their Bitcoin acceptance plans until today, the next company to step forward may come from a place where we least expect it.", "year": 2013, "month": 2, "day": 15}
{"title": "ASICMiner Starts Hashing", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/asicminer-starts-hashing-1360889218/", "birthday": "Feb 14, 2013  7:46 PM EST", "date": "2013-02-15 00:46:00", "content": "Today, ASICMiner, one of the three major developers of ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit)-based Bitcoin mining hardware, has announced that they have turned on their chips, and are outputting 1.7 TH/s of hashing power in a testing run. The event makes them the second company after Avalon to have working ASIC hardware, leaving the last remaining competitor, Butterfly Labs, behind. The 1.7 TH/s testing run represents only a small portion of the company\u2019s full hashing power; ASICMiner has reported that their full first batch will have over 12 TH/s of hashing power, or slightly over half that shipped by Avalon, and intends to start the remaining batch running very soon; \u201cthe real update will be given in a few hours,\u201d ASICMiner reports.\nASICMiner differs from its two competitors in one key way: it is not actually selling any mining rigs to consumers. Rather, the company is keeping all of its hardware in house, and financed its development through 2012 by issuing company shares. The shares were originally released in August on the (now-defunct) Global Bitcoin Stock Exchange, opening up 7.5% of the company\u2019s future profits to investors at a valuation of 40,000 BTC for the entire company. The offering was a success, selling out within days. The setup proved to be problematic when the GLBSE unexpectedly shut down, causing the company to lose contact with many of its investors, but the company finally received the shareholder database from the GLBSE in December, and shares will once again start trading and paying dividends on a yet-unspecified alternate platform soon.\nNetwork hash power is currently at around 25 TH/s, suggesting that many Avalon customers still have not received their rigs. Once most of Avalon\u2019s customers turn their hardware on and ASICMiner starts hashing, network hash power is expected to increase to about 40-50 TH/s \u2013 with some old GPU miners dropping out because of the increased difficulty. February is proving to be a great month for Bitcoin miners so far; the sudden rise in price has allowed Jeff Garzik\u2019s Avalon machine to pay for itself in nine days, and ensured that miners\u2019 operating margins are now higher than they were before the mining reward drop in December. Butterfly Labs reports that their chips have been delivered to the bumping facility, suggesting that while they are not shipping just yet production is finally nearing completion; unfortunately, in a market where timing is everything, their customers will not be able to benefit from the same window of opportunity that Avalon and ASICMiner have. However, some Butterfly Labs consumers will be able to enjoy a 10-25% discount from their next purchase if they ordered early. Meanwhile, Avalon and ASICMiner are already working on second batches, with ASICMiner reporting that their next batch, which is \u201cordered and being produced in the fab already,\u201d [will be 50 TH/s](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=99497.msg1529563#msg1529563). Although the ASIC mining market is unfolding much more slowly than many of us had predicted, it looks like the next two months will be the time that the new machines finally start to come online en masse.", "year": 2013, "month": 2, "day": 15}
{"title": "$13 to $26: Exploring The Bitcoin Rally", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/13-to-26-exploring-the-bitcoin-rally-1360869479/", "birthday": "Feb 14, 2013  2:17 PM EST", "date": "2013-02-14 19:17:00", "content": "Over the past month or so, we have seen Bitcoin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s price leave the comfortable range of $10 to $14 that they had been at for nearly four months and embark on a steady course upward that has almost precisely doubled its value since then. The long road up first started on January 6 when, several days after striking the January 1 low of $13.16, the currency began a slow and steady rise of about $0.15 per day. But it did not really pick up until January 16, a point a few days after the currency broke through $14 for the first time since August where Bitcoin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s value spiked up suddenly to about $14.7. From there, $15 fell quickly and a stream of steady, progressive growth ensued.\nThe first shock came on January 25, just after the price first broke 19:\n\nBitcoin precipitously fell to $18, then $16, then finally, after a brief but temporary recovery to $17.3, hit a low of $15.6, erasing all of the progress of the past\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 four days. From there, however, the price simply picked back up on its course, and kept going. The next run down happened from $20, after the price struck against $21.5, failed to get further, and struggled for two days before suddenly collapsing the moment it went below the $20 threshold.\n\nBut from there, the recovery was rapid. There was no double-dip, and the price spiked back up to pre-drop levels within twelve hours. It fell back to $19.5 for a few hours and then stayed at $20 for a day, but then Bitcoin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s growth simply resumed, almost as if nothing had happened.\nThe third leg, however, has been different. Unlike the first two legs, which were helped along by a background of constant positive news involving Bitcoin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s merchant service providers, positive media attention, and the gambling sector, since then attention on Bitcoin has quieted down somewhat. The Google Trends volume, which hit its highest levels since November on Feb 2, has since receded somewhat, albeit at a higher level than before the rally first started:\n\nThe price continued soaring, climbing an average of fifty cents per day, but signs slowly began to change. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cask\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (selling) side of MtGox\\xe2\\x80\\x99s order book, which was thin enough that a buyer with $600,000 could have brought the currency past the holy grail of $31.91 at $19, has since thickened to the point of such a jump requiring over $1 million to create, despite the current price being twice as close. Bitcoin exchanges\\xe2\\x80\\x99 trade volume decreased \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a common sign that a trend may be nearing completion. For ten days the price kept climbing, touching $26.3 on February 13, but then finally the market changed. The price began to slide down \\xe2\\x80\\x93 slowly at first, but then more quickly once it broke below its two-day trendline, and the market entered panic mode once the price lost its key psychological threshold of $25:\n\nHowever, although the fall was deep, it was also brief, and once the drop encountered serious resistance in the $21.8-$22.8 range it quickly spiked back up again. Even more rapidly than it fell, it rose back to $25.48, and after a brief slump back to $24 went on to hit $26.65, even higher than the $26.3 peak that the price had reached the day before.\n\nWhat are the lessons that we can extract from this whole ordeal?\nAt least for now, it seems like the market does not even want a correction. Traditional technical analysis theory introduces a concept of Fibonacci retracements, where a price correction backtracks 38% or 62% (three eights and five eighths, both ratios between small Fibonacci numbers) of the rally\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gains, and a correction within a correction \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the spike back up that inevitably follows a fall \\xe2\\x80\\x93 itself tends to follow the same patterns. Here, the conventional wisdom has been broken. Bitcoin fell down, but within hours it came back even stronger. Psychological thresholds matter. In the last two price charts above, one can clearly see how the price began to drop quickly once it broke below a key psychological threshold that Bitcoin had gained only a few days earlier. A trading strategy that Bitcoin traders may wish to consider is setting up an automated sell order that would trigger whenever the price breaks below a round number (eg. $25, $30, $40) that it had not gone below for at least a day prior.Trendlines matter. Although with Bitcoin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ups and downs it may seem hard to believe, over the past two years the currency has in fact been following a single, consistent trendline of gentle exponential growth:\n\nNote the log scale on the right, which makes any exponential curve look like a straight line. Notice how every time the price threatened to fall, or simply stagnate, below the line it somehow always spiked back up just in time. This time is no exception. At the beginning of January, the price had simply been at the $10-$14 level far too long, and it was threatening to break the pattern, and so just in time it got the upward boost that it needed. Now, we are well above this line, and so there is considerable room for Bitcoin to fall, but in the near term there is another trendline to watch:\n\nNotice how the three times that the price quickly fell it did go below the line. But then, it quickly came back up again. Unless Bitcoin starts seeing exponential growth in public attention and business adoption within the next few weeks the trendline will likely break, and we may well enter another period of stagnation backed up by the lower trend, but for now the markets appear intent on keeping at it.\nSo what factors are there to show that this recent doubling is backed up by genuine adoption, and not merely a bubble? There is not as much news as in January, but there are a few items to keep in mind:\nYesterday, the Bitcoin Reddit community and the Bitcoin poker site Seals with Clubs both saw a large volume of users. Reddit broke past 300, over three times its usual volume of 100. Seals with Clubs saw over 200 users online at the same time.Coinbase reached its maximum level of purchases. The Bitcoin exchange intermediary had also reported their volume exceeding $1 million per month just a few days earlier, and the more recent news suggests that Coinbase will only keep getting more popular as time goes on.

Market prediction is a difficult thing; if it were easy, Bitcoin would have immediately jumped all the way to some final price back in 2009. Perhaps the best strategy for most of us is to simply wait and see.", "year": 2013, "month": 2, "day": 14}

The monthly deadlines come so quickly that it is difficult to pass sweeping changes through the narrow windows of opportunity. Instead, it is better to make incremental changes during every window that we get.We appreciate your patience and continued support as we make Bitcoin Magazine into a professional, reliable, first-class product, designed to increase the value of every person invested in Bitcoin. Here are some of the improvements we have made in a short period of time:\n1. Delivery Improvements\u00a0Magazines mailed from Downtown Orlando Post office[/caption]One of the challenges that the magazine faced was the slow and unreliable physical delivery to its customers. Bittalk Media LTD, the prior publishing company, had been using the Romanian postal service to mail all magazines worldwide from Romania. Many times they would get lost or delayed, especially to destinations outside of Europe. Starting in January with issue 6, we began to make incremental improvements.\n Issue 6 for all subscribers in North America and South America was mailed from Orlando FL. \u00a0This is more expensive, but the reliability is worth it. Issue 6 is available for sale on Amazon.com (and stored at Amazon\u2019s warehouses so it is eligible for Free Shipping to Amazon Prime members).\n Issue 7 is now available for sale on Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk (for US and UK customers). Again the inventory is stored in Amazon\u2019s warehouses in the USA and UK for quick delivery, and easy Amazon ordering.\n\n2. New WebStoreWe have launched a new webstore that is easier for us to manage on the back-end, but also offers BitPay\u2019s integration with Amazon for fulfillment.If you are in the US or UK, buy issue 7 with Bitcoins at http://bitcoinmagazine.com/shop and your order will be shipped directly to you from Amazon, with Free Shipping! If you are in Europe, your order will be shipped from Romania. If you are anywhere else in the world, your order will be shipped from Atlanta, with free shipping to Canada.If this continues to work well, we will deliver some back issues to Amazon\u2019s warehouses, so all issues (past and future) will be eventually available on Amazon. Again these are only available for shipment within the US and UK. Shipping internationally from Amazon is very expensive.\n3. Advertising\u00a0In the 2 months since we have been handling the operations of Bitcoin Magazine, we have increased the number of advertisers from 5 to 11. Advertising is extremely important to support the creation and the printing of the magazine, so that we can continue to offer low prices to subscribers.\n4. New Website\u00a0We have recently launched a newly designed website that is elegant and full of information. BitcoinMagazine.com will be the go-to place for timely and accurate reporting about Bitcoin.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n5. Next Steps\n We will begin to release issues in a digital format as well, starting with Apple Newsstand. We will begin to translate the digital issues into multiple languages. We will continue to expand our advertising base to provide the funding needed for the new features. We will add back issue stock to Amazon warehouses in the US and UK. We will continue to improve the quality of the content and service. We will strive to make Bitcoin Magazine and https://bitcoinmagazine.com into polished products that everyone in the Bitcoin community can use to help educate their friends and family.\ntony@bitcoinmagazine.com\n\nTony Gallippi,\u00a0Executive Publisher\n\n\n\n", "year": 2013, "month": 2, "day": 20}

The Archive describes itself as \u201ca non-profit digital library offering free universal access to books, movies & music, as well as 267 billion archived web pages\u201d, and is most well-known for two key projects. First, the Archive maintains the Wayback Machine, a service that allows anyone to access old versions of web pages, including potentially web pages that have since disappeared from the internet, from as far back as 1996. Second, the organization\u2019s website features a collection of millions of works in video, music, audio and text. The Archive is also actively attempting to preserve older works of literature by converting them into a digital form, with 23 scanning centers in 5 countries uploading 1,000 new books to its collection every year, and maintains a number of smaller projects including its collection of NASA images.\nThe Archive is not the only \u201copen-source\u201d digital library out there \u2013 the Gutenberg project also comes to mind, but it is one of the largest, and projects like it play an important role in keeping public domain books accessible as we rapidly transition to a digital age. Although companies like Google have also stepped in to fill the role with projects like Google Cache and Google Books, many are worried about what would happen if the only records of a large number of important cultural artifacts were left in the hands of a single large corporation, and to those concerned about such issues the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine and Open Library projects provide a compelling alternative.\nThe organization first started accepting Bitcoin for donations in December 2012. \u201cAt the end of 2011,\u201d Brewster Kahle relates, \u201cwe did a fundraiser, we were trying to raise money at the Internet Archive by putting up a banner, and we got a lot of emails saying we should take Bitcoin. I thought, I\u2019m going to try a test. I took our head of administration \u2013 she\u2019s a capable woman but not technical at all \u2013 and said, if you can figure out how to take Bitcoin, we\u2019ll take Bitcoin. She downloaded BitcoinQt, and it was slow but it worked.\u201d The Archive has received over $5,600 in Bitcoin donations since then.\nArchive.org is listed by Alexa as the 233rd most popular site in the world, placing it only behind Reddit and WordPress in terms of organizations that accept Bitcoin. As far as organizations paying employees in Bitcoin go, however, the Archive is by far the largest. The only other nonprofit known to do such a thing is the P2P foundation, which announced its plans to pay employees in bitcoin in March 2012, although many Bitcoin-specific nonprofits businesses are likely already paying their employees in bitcoin without feeling the need to explicitly mention it \u2013 Bitcoin Magazine itself being one example.\nWhen asked why he is so interested in accepting and promoting Bitcoin, Kahle\u2019s response is one that many people in the Bitcoin community can related to. \u201cI think that at the Internet Archive,\u201d Kahle said in a phone interview, \u201cwe see ourselves as coming from the net. As an organization we exist because of the internet, and I think of Bitcoin as a creature of the net. It\u2019s a fantastically interesting idea, and to the extent that we\u2019re all trying to build a new future, a better future, let\u2019s try and round it out.\u201d\nHowever, Kahle reminds us, the Internet Archive is a nonprofit organization, and relies heavily on donations to keep its services running. Those who support what the Internet Archive is doing and wish to see it continue to preserve and digitize even more content, as well as those who simply wish to help Bitcoin-accepting organizations grow and succeed, are encouraged to donate to its public address, which can be found here on its website (although other methods of payment are also always welcome). If the Internet Archive continues to receive enough funding to maintain this initiative, it will provide yet another boost to Bitcoin\u2019s legitimacy, and perhaps even encourage other organizations and even businesses to follow suit. With bitcoins flowing around in a closed loop, passing from average Bitcoin users to businesses and organizations like the Internet Archive, and from there directly to their employees who then spend it at other Bitcoin businesses without being converted to and from USD along the way, it looks like Bitcoin is well on its way to becoming a true, self-sustaining currency.", "year": 2013, "month": 2, "day": 22}
{"title": "Coinlab Bringing Bitcoin to Wall Street with MtGox Deal", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/coinlab-bringing-bitcoin-to-wall-street-with-mtgox-deal-1361988036/", "birthday": "Feb 27, 2013  1:00 PM EST", "date": "2013-02-27 18:00:00", "content": "Photo: Wallstreet Charging Bull, CC BY 2.0 herval, Flickr\nA venture capitalist backed Bitcoin company wants to make it safe for U.S. and Canadian investors to do large block trades of Bitcoins and keep them ultra-secure from loss. Coinlab has worked for a year to sign an exclusive long term deal with Bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox. The Silicon Valley-based company will take over exchange transactions for all U.S. and Canada clients meaning your money will get moved to a U.S. bank and Coinlab will now be the clearing pool for all peer-to-peer transaction on the Mt.Gox exchange. The safeguards they have set up is a move to drive more U.S. volume in Bitcoins along with paving a way for institutional investors and high net-worth individuals to buy and hold large amounts of the digital currency.\n\u201c80 percent of Mt.Gox traffic already comes from this area. We are essentially buying their book of traffic,\u201d Peter Vessenes told Bitcoin Magazine in an interview. The goal is to move customers\u2019 money from overseas to Silicon Valley Bank by March 22nd. This should cut down on the fees, currently around $60, that clients pay Mt.Gox for international wire transfers to their U.S. bank.\nCoinlab was the first Bitcoin company to get venture capital money, over $500,000, last year. They were known as providing games paid for with Bitcoins but this move into mass retail transaction service takes the firm into a whole new sphere.\nRight now an average Mt.Gox customer pays .6% per transaction, volume over 10,000 pays only .3%. These tier two customers will now get live phone help via Coinlab experts. Vessenes says large transactions will still have to get reported to FinCEN as Coinlab wants to be observant of U.S. money laundering rules. There could be a know-your-customer (KYC) process to opening an account but Coinlab is still working on protecting anonymity.\nVessenes told Bitcoin Magazine in previous interviews last year that whoever can figure out how to store Bitcoins \u2013 in 250,000 to 500,000 blocks \u2013 and make the client feel like they are safely in a bank vault will really help make the digital currency accessible to big money investors.\nThe process Coinlab came up with for safety feels like a James Bond transaction with private and public keys, and they\u2019ve gone old school storing a Rubik\u2019s cube set of private key data in hard safes. The private keys will be split into three parts with only two needed to unlock your transaction. They won\u2019t be stored in a computer database but printed and placed in a vault. Who can open the vault will be divided up; meaning a red team vault opener won\u2019t be able to open the blue team\u2019s vault.\nThe folks at Coinlab are also working to get your data insured for loss. Lloyds of London does these kinds of transactions but Coinlab has yet to finalize an insurance agreement. Of course they\u2019d likely have to make sure there is a plan to make sure that the vault openers don\u2019t get kidnapped. If they can get storage insurance they\u2019ve just jumped the fence into Main Street\u2019s arms.\nIf you want to want to buy large amounts of bitcoins without using your own cash you\u2019ll still have to find a lender to give you leverage though \u2014 Coinlab isn\u2019t a bank \u2013 or regulated by any US or Canadian securities or banking regulators. But there is a hint in their new deal that shows they are working to find a way to get liquidity to Forex broker dealers or private wealth managers to help high net-worth individuals invest long-term in bitcoins.\nVessenes told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cOur deal with Mt.Gox means we just picked a retail customer but I care very much about the needs of the institutional investors.\u201d Coinlab\u2019s strategy page has a nifty live action chart of Bitcoin liquidity which will feature a buy and sell button. The company will also work on alerts to their customers about big price swings.\n\u201cCoinlab\u2019s deal with Mt.Gox is great for Bitcoin liquidity in the US and Canada. It\u2019s nice to see more formalized channels emerging here for Bitcoin FX. This is the start of many terrific things for Coinlab and the global FX market is $4 trillion but we still have a long way to go,\u201d Joel Yarmon of Draper Associates, who invested in Coinlab, told Bitcoin Magazine.\nJay Walker, a forex prop trader, said he\u2019d jump to any forex broker deal that would allow him to do currency pair trades and get paid out in bitcoins. This is something the Bitcoin exchanges could do by signing deals with forex broker deals \u2013 assuming they get through each country\u2019s regulatory process. Walker also said he\u2019d love the opportunity to short Bitcoins. Of course to short Bitcoins some smart entrepreneur would have to come up with a credit or Bitcoin borrow system to make that happen but it\u2019s clear the players in this field are thinking about the market demand for it.", "year": 2013, "month": 2, "day": 27}
{"title": "Introducing Ripple", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/introducing-ripple/", "birthday": "Feb 26, 2013  9:19 PM EST", "date": "2013-02-27 02:19:00", "content": "Up until now Bitcoin has been, by far, the most powerful contender in the cryptocurrency market. Other alternative coins, such as\u00a0Namecoin,\u00a0Solidcoin and\u00a0Litecoin, have arisen to offer various modifications on the core Bitcoin concept but, despite over a year\u2019s worth of development and dozens of attempts, none have achieved anything close to Bitcoin\u2019s level of success. Litecoin is perhaps the most prominent out of all the alternatives, its price hovering around\u00a0$0.07 USD and even slowly increasing over the past six months, but so far the overwhelming majority of merchants \u2013 and merchant platforms, for that matter \u2013 have seen no reason to pay attention to them. Now, that may finally change with decentralized cryptocurrency\u2019s new kid on the block: Ripple.\nThe Ripple project is actually older than Bitcoin itself. The original implementation was created by Ryan Fugger in 2004, the intent being to create a monetary system that was decentralized and could effectively empower individuals and communities to create their own money. All money in Ripple is explicitly represented as debt, with transactions simply consisting of balances being shifted on a series of imaginary credit lines from the payer to the receiver. In order to explain how this works in practice, consider a simple example. Suppose there are two friends, B and C, taking a road trip, and they both decided to bring along a friend of their own; B brought his friend A and C brought his friend D. A knows B, but has never met C and D before and they may well never meet again, and similarly D has never met A and B. Now, suppose that A and D are out getting a coffee, but D does not have money to pay. So A pays for both coffees, $3 each, and D agrees to pay A back through Ripple. Because it would make no sense to have D owe $3 to A, as he may well never have an opportunity to pay back, he instead agrees to owe $3 to C, C agrees to owe $3 to B and B agrees to owe $3 to A.\nPerhaps B already owed $2 to C beforehand \u2013 in that case, the debt would be cancelled and C would only owe $1 to B after the transaction. The key point is that all debts are between people who have an established trust relationship (in conventional financial parlance, \u201ccredit line\u201d), and so can trust each other to pay each other back as needed. By using such a chain of trust, money can change hands even between people who do not know each other at all. It has often been stated that any two individuals in the world are at a distance of, at most, six degrees of separation \u2013 that is, given any two people in the world, one can always connect them together with a chain of people who know each other, with at most five links in between.\nOn some level, this is quite similar to the way the banking system already works today. International wire transfers to and from countries around the world are gathered together by banks, transfers between banks are canceled out as much as possible, and at the end of the day, if one bank gives out more money than it takes in, the banks sort things out through various systems specifically designed for the purpose. In Middle Eastern countries, there exists a somewhat more decentralized version of the concept in the form of hawala networks. What the original Ripple project sought to accomplish is effectively the democratization of this idea: everyone can be their own bank, issuing, accepting and acting as a conduit for loans all at the same time.\nThe project saw some success; the largest current implementations of the idea, maintained by Ryan Fugger himself, can be found at\u00a0classic.ripplpay.com and\u00a0villages.cc, and the former has over four thousand users signed up. In September 2010, Sepp Hasslberger\u00a0wrote that \u201cRipple is alive and well.\u201d However, the Ripple communities that have formed over the years were without exception small and disparate, never extending beyond the isolated communities that originally formed them. The reason why is simple: in order to participate, you have to already have a friend in the network. Otherwise, there would be no way to form a chain of credit lines between you and any other user, and so you would not be able to make any transactions. There was also another flaw: the software was centralized. Although Fugger envisioned a monetary system that was distributed and where anyone could equally participate, the system keeping track of all the credit lines and balances still had to be centrally controlled.\nNow, the Ripple project is finally ready to solve these problems, and has gathered a highly competent team of businessmen and developers to help them do so. The CEO, Chris Larsen, is a new face in the cryptocurrency community, but Bitcoin users are likely to recognize two familiar names: Jed McCaleb, founder of MtGox, by far the largest Bitcoin exchange in the Bitcoin community, and Stefan Thomas, a Bitcoin developer responsible for\u00a0BitcoinJS. Ripple\u2019s parent company, OpenCoin, is not willing to disclose its exact number of employees, but does claim that it is already one of the largest companies in the cryptocurrency community.\nThe level of influence that OpenCoin has over the Ripple network is expected to decrease over time. Currently, the Ripple client and a sample gateway implementation are already available, so the tools are there for alternative Ripple implementations to start to be developed. The server is still closed, but that is a matter of practicality more than control; \u201cChanges are still flying around at a rapid pace,\u201d a Ripple developer writes; \u201cWe want to [open source the server] as soon as we can so people can have more confidence in the system. Right now all we can publicly say is: Soonish, As soon as practical. We recognize that in order to succeed Ripple must be open source.\u201d Once the server is release, in theory OpenCoin will have as little power over the Ripple network as the Bitcoin Foundation has over Bitcoin.\nThe\u00a0new version of Ripple fixes both of the major issues that the old one faced. The problem of disparate communities is solved in two ways: a specialized Ripple-specific currency, and a system of \u201cgateways\u201d. Unlike everything else stored in the network, the special currency, \u201cripples\u201d (or \u201cripple credits\u201d or XRP), is not debt-based \u2013 it can be sent from one Ripple address to another over the Ripple network just like bitcoins are sent over the Bitcoin network. Thus, if you wanted to send money to someone who was not part of your local trust network, all you would need to do is convert it into XRP, send over the XRP, and have them convert it back. Currency conversion can even be done \u201catomically\u201d through the built-in decentralized exchange process \u2013 that is, there is no way for A or B to renege on their side of the deal, as the exchange is encoded into the ledger all at the same time.\nGateways are the other major development in the new Ripple\u2019s solution to the sparse user problem. A gateway is essentially a commercial service that plays the role of being a credit intermediary for those who do not already know anyone already using Ripple to connect through \u2013 or perhaps those who do not want to connect through someone that they already know, preferring the professionalism of a commercial service. The gateway would serve as the first link in the trust chain between the user and the recipient whenever the user wants to make a payment, and the last link whenever the user wants to receive one. A user can trust many gateways at the same time, so the system still preserves a measure of decentralization comparable to mining pools.\nThere is nothing special about the status of a gateway; anyone can become one, and so a continuum of network topologies ranging from a replica of modern centralized banking to a full peer-to-peer system can function under the Ripple protocol. For the first few years, the Ripple developers believe, gateways are likely to be the norm, but if Ripple succeeds and grows, it may well happen that as the system gains enough market share to support it, a friend-to-friend architecture, as envisioned by the original Ripple project, will gradually emerge.\nThe gateway system is not perfect. There is no inherent mechanism to ensure that gateways will not default on their loans, and long-time Bitcoin users familiar with the debacles of MyBitcoin, Bitcoinica, Pirate and Bitfloor are, rightfully, wary of a system that requires trust in third-party organizations in order to function. So far, Ripple developers have not come up with a clean and satisfying response to the problem, and it may well be that no such response exists. Ultimately, Ripple does not provide a cryptographic solution to the trust problem, and keeping fraudulent gateways under control will have to be done by more traditional mechanisms instead \u2013 clear, industry standard, expectations on gateways\u2019 security, in a similar spirit to all major Bitcoin exchanges\u2019 policy of keeping over 80% of customer funds stored in an offline location where there is no way to access them without manual assistance, and outright fraud will have to be met with the help of the good old-fashioned legal system.\nThe other main aspect of Ripple is its decentralization. At the core, Ripple\u2019s mechanism for keeping track of balances is similar to Bitcoin; there is a concept of addresses, public and private keys, and modifications to the database are done through a system of digitally signed transactions. In fact, Ripple uses precisely the same elliptic curve specifications as Bitcoin, with the exception of a different leading byte in the address format (hence addresses starting with \u201cr\u201d and not \u201c1\u201d), so one can use the same private and public keys to sign transactions and messages in the Bitcoin,\u00a0BitMessage and Ripple networks. However, that is where the similarities end. Ripple has no proof of work and no concept of mining; instead, transactions are simply propagated through the network, and given a set of contradictory transactions \u2013 for example, a dishonest customer writing transactions to send the same $100 to ten different merchants with the hope of getting $1000 worth of goods, clients determine which one came first, and which ones should therefore be thrown out as illegitimate, through a process that the Ripple developers call consensus.\nConsensus is essentially an improved version of the process that already takes place in the Bitcoin network for zero-confirmation transactions. Individual nodes decide which version of a new ledger to accept by polling the nodes around them to see what the majority opinion is, allowing the network to quickly settle on a single choice. The process is much faster than Bitcoin block confirmation; a new ledger state is created roughly every 5-10 seconds, allowing for nearly instant confirmations.\nThe Bitcoin developers had the option of implementing such a strategy themselves, but they did not do so for two reasons. First, if applied to Bitcoin, the approach would have a significant risk of causing chain fragmentation, where two parts of the network settle on irreconcilable transaction histories, and so Bitcoin essentially splits in half. Second, the approach, at least as described above, is vulnerable to something called a\u00a0Sybil attack \u2013 an attacker can employ various forms of proxying and IP address spoofing techniques to pretend to be a million separate nodes, and so overwhelm the opinion of the rest of the network through sheer numbers.\nRipple fixes both of these problems by introducing a concept of trust. Every user in Ripple has a \u201cunique node list\u201d (UNL), a list of nodes that they know are not likely to collude against them \u2013 the operative word being \u201ccollude\u201d. Each individual node may well be owned by a shady character who is trying to pull off double spending frauds themselves, and the system would still likely work just fine. What matters is that the nodes are not likely to work together to push a single fraudulent transaction history that could compete against, and potentially overcome, the majority consensus of the network. Competing major businesses, a diverse set of trusted community members, gateways and nonprofit organizations are all likely to be part of individual node lists.\nThe UNL system also ensures that the network is tightly linked. Every node is connected to every other node in millions of ways, and so all nodes are only at most a few hops away from each other. Thus, any fragmentation would rapidly resolve itself. \u201cAs long as there is some degree of inter-connectivity between UNLs,\u201d the\u00a0Ripple wiki article states, \u201cconsensus will rapidly be reached. UNLs will at least be what is called a small world network (similar to the networks of friends on Facebook) though we suspect in practice there will be much more overlap than that.\u201d For those who are unsatisfied with this explanation, \u201cA more rigorous mathematical proof is coming soon.\u201d\nRipple does have a \u201cledger chain\u201d, similar to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, but with one major difference. Unlike the Bitcoin blockchain, every Ripple ledger state consists of a \u201ctransaction tree\u201d, showing the transactions that have taken place since the last ledger, and the \u201cstate tree\u201d, containing all of the information needed to know all of the account balances and credit limits in the Ripple system, reducing the information that a node needs to store to serve as a fully functioning member of the Ripple network to just the last ledger state. Additionally, there is a minimum balance of 200 XRP for creating an address and an additional 50 XRP for creating a credit line, creating a strong disincentive against bloating the ledger state with many addresses. As a result, it is expected that the majority of Ripple clients will, in fact, be fully participating nodes, as the cost of full participation is small enough to be negligible for most computers.\nThe lack of mining introduces an aspect to Ripple which can be thought of as both a strength and a weakness. Because there is no mining, there can be no fair mechanism to automatically distribute XRP to users, and so the Ripple developers went with the simplest solution: starting off with all 100 billion XRP that will ever exist in their own wallets. OpenCoin intends to give XRP away to people around the world as widely as they can, targeting Bitcoin users first as an initial userbase, and then moving on to offering XRP to anyone who wants it, limiting abuse by requiring authentication mechanisms like Facebook accounts and cell phone numbers to hand out the credits. The handout process seems awkward, but given the circumstances it is the best that the Ripple developers can do; \u201cif we could immediately distribute all the Ripple credits that we want to distribute equally to everyone in the world, we would,\u201d Ripple CEO Chris Larsen says in a phone interview. OpenCoin intends to give away over 55 billion XRP through their various giveaways, and the rest of the Ripple credits the company will use to fund development and promotion of the Ripple system.\nHowever, because of the monetary distribution, OpenCoin may well face an uphill battle convincing the community that they can be trusted. The developer of another alternative cryptocurrency, Tenebrix, tried the strategy of creating an initial number of coins for himself in 2011, ostensibly (and, quite likely, genuinely) for the purpose of funding development, but the community widely decried the move as unfair and moved on to Litecoin as an alternative. Perhaps Ripple will be different; unlike Tenebrix, Ripple introduces a substantial number of features beyond those that Bitcoin itself already offers, to the point of being an innovation in digital currency almost as significant as Bitcoin itself. \u201cRipple will be a great thing for the world,\u201d an OpenCoin employee who wishes to remain anonymous reminds us, \u201cbut unfortunately, in order to make it work, we have to have funding. If the community has any ideas on how we can handle this fairly, we\u2019re open.\u201d\nAnother consequence of the lack of mining is the rapidly deflationary nature of XRP. Unlike BTC, where the total number of currency units in existence increases more and more slowly with every passing year until eventually stabilizing at a permanent 21 million in 2140, the number of XRP starts off at an all-time maximum of 100 billion and then immediately starts permanently decreasing as transaction fees are paid.\nFor those who want to try Ripple now, there are already two gateways working with Ripple: BitStamp and WeExchange, both of which offer the ability to deposit a number of different currencies into your Ripple account. There is already one merchant accepting Ripple, the VPN provider Private Internet Access. For more details on how to use Ripple, see our how to article here.\nAltogether, what Ripple has accomplished is impressive. With Ripple, we have a way of sending, receiving, and holding any currency \u2013 not just one specific cryptocurrency \u2013 in a decentralized way. The currency can be anything; one can imagine storing USD, CAD, gold or even airplane miles in the Ripple network, as long as there are enough people, or at least one gateway, willing to deal with them. For those who want the advantages that cryptocurrency offers, such as the increased financial freedom and privacy, cryptographically guaranteed security, minimal fees, irrelevance of national borders, and advanced features such as cryptographically enforced\u00a0contracts and\u00a0brainwallets, but do not want to deal with Bitcoin\u2019s volatile value, Ripple is the solution. Ripple also has the potential for much greater integration with the existing banking system, as its currency exchange is a service that even existing financial businesses will quickly be able to benefit from. For those who are afraid of the prospect of gateways defaulting or disappearing, or who wish the greater privacy that Bitcoin\u2019s trust-free anonymity offers, Bitcoin continues to be the best bet. Regardless, the fact that Bitcoin now has a strong and compelling alternative makes it clearer than ever that the idea of cryptocurrency as a whole is here to stay.\nAn expanded version of this article will appear in Bitcoin Magazine print edition, issue 8.

{"title": "Ripple: Getting Started Guide", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/ripple-getting-started-guide-1361931573/", "birthday": "Feb 26, 2013  9:19 PM EST", "date": "2013-02-27 02:19:00", "content": "By now, you may have already heard of Ripple, the new decentralized cryptocurrency project that has been making waves (pun intended) in the Bitcoin community. While Bitcoin allows anyone to hold, send and receive bitcoins over a decentralized network to and from anywhere in the world with extremely low fees, Ripple seeks to allow anyone to do the same thing with any other currency as well.\nIn order to get started with Ripple, you will first need to open a Ripple wallet. Just like Bitcoin in 2009, there is currently only one Ripple client available, the official one at ripple.com, although it is much more powerful and much easier to use than BitcoinQt \u2013 the client is a web interface, no software downloads required. The process is as simple as creating an account at any other website; simply click \u201cStart ripple\u201d followed by \u201cCreate an account\u201d and go from there.\nOnce you have an account, the next step is to activate it. Unlike in Bitcoin, you cannot simply create as many Ripple accounts as you want simply by generating new private keys; you also need to make an initial deposit of 50 XRP, Ripple\u2019s internal currency, in order for the account to become usable. At this point, there are two ways to get this initial deposit. First, OpenCoin sometimes makes free XRP giveaways, handing out generous quantities of XRP to as many people as it can reach. For now, the company is targeting the Bitcoin community, and so its first major giveaway required users to post in a forum thread on [Bitcointalk](http://bitcointalk.org), a popular Bitcoin forum. Later on, giveaways based on Facebook accounts and cell phone numbers are both likely to take place. If you are not lucky enough to spot a giveaway, or too impatient to wait for one, you can find someone else to buy XRP from. The largest Ripple communities right now are at https://ripple.com/forum/ and http://reddit.com/r/ripplers; if you have BTC to trade, you can easily find someone to give XRP in exchange. If you want to buy more XRP later there is also a \u201cdecentralized exchange\u201d inside of Ripple that allows you to exchange any other currency within the Ripple system for XRP, but it requires you to already have 50 XRP in your account to use.\nThe process for sending and receiving in Ripple is the same as with Bitcoin; in the \u201cReceive\u201d tab of the Ripple wallet, the interface provides you with a Ripple address, which looks exactly like a Bitcoin address with the exception of starting with an \u201cr\u201d instead of a \u201c1\u201d. To send a payment to someone, you simply enter their address, the currency and the amount you wish to send in the \u201cSend\u201d tab. The process can be used to send any currency that you have in your Ripple account, although if you and the recipient are not linked through a chain of trust the only currency that you will be able to convert is XRP.\nOnce your account is loaded with at least 50 XRP, you will likely want to get some money in other currencies (eg. BTC or USD) into your account. In order to do this, you will need to open an account at a gateway. There are two options for gateways so far: WeExchange and BitStamp. The process with WeExchange works as follows. First, sign up and create a WeExchange account. Login to WeExchange and go to Funds -> Add Funds -> BTC to get a Bitcoin address that you can deposit your bitcoin to (fiat currencies can be deposited too but, as usual, Bitcoin is by far the easiest). Once WeExchange confirms your deposit, go to Funds -> Withdraw Funds -> Ripple. At the bottom of the page, you will see a list of addresses you can trust. Open your Ripple wallet and go to the \u201cAdvanced\u201d tab. Click \u201cTrust\u201d, and add the BTC address to your trust list, entering a trust amount at least as large as what you are depositing. This creates a credit line between you and WeExchange that allows WeExchange to send you BTC \u2013 or, more precisely, an IOU for BTC, through the Ripple network. Then go to the \u201cReceive\u201d tab and copy your Ripple address. Back in WeExchange, select \u201cBTC\u201d as the withdraw currency, enter the deposit amount and paste in your Ripple address. And, there you go, you have BTC in your Ripple account.\nIn order to convert the BTC into another currency, once again in Ripple go to the \u201cAdvanced\u201d tab and click \u201cTrade\u201d. At the top of the trade interface, select the \u201cBTC/XRP\u201d option if it is not selected already, and click on \u201cchange issuer\u201d. Copy in the same Ripple address that you entered into your trust list to set WeExchange as the currency issuer for BTC. Then, through the trade interface, sell your BTC for the other currency just like you would trade BTC for fiat currency at an exchange like MtGox or BitStamp. Unless you decided to make an offer above the current \u201cbid\u201d price in an attempt to secure for yourself a better deal, the trade should process quickly and, voila, you have the currency of your choice.\nAs for where you can spend your Ripple funds, so far there is only one merchant accepting Ripple for payment: Private Internet Access. Private Internet Access currently only takes XRP \u2013 no Ripple USD or BTC transfers yet, and the XRP payment option is, for now, fairly expensive compared to the USD or BTC price of $39.95 per year since XRP does not yet have a clear market price. Note that when Private Internet Access provides the address for you to send the XRP, the address that it gives includes a numerical token at the end \u2013 something like r9EUYx41zx3audeARUwpkDF7VuwcmbwYTU?dt=2399767994. Make sure to include the full address, with the token, when making your payment \u2013 the token is included in the Ripple transaction, and tells Private Internet Access which order the payment is for.\nHopefully, soon more merchants will start accepting Ripple for payment, and even before that happens there is always the option of buying goods or labor over-the-counter on https://ripple.com/forum/ or http://reddit.com/r/ripplers. For now, good luck exploring the latest and greatest that cryptocurrency has to offer!", "year": 2013, "month": 2, "day": 27}

They accused Megaupload owner Kim Dotcom of a number of criminal indictments and begun a legal case.\nMega (previously Megaupload) is now accepting Bitcoin through two resellers. They are immune to economic censorship through the power of cryptocurrency.\nThe Megaupload case followed on from a few months of increasingly aggressive posturing and sharp words from US law enforcement towards internet services, in particular file sharing services that allow people to share files amongst each other. Seeking to make an example out of one of the biggest, they started a large scale operation to take down Megaupload.\nThis happened once before. Here in the UK, the IWF (Internet Watch Foundation) is a censoring system for the internet. In 1996, the Metropolitan Police started requesting the banning of illegal content by ISPs in the UK. With veiled sly threats they asked that ISPs engage in \u2018self-enforcement\u2019 rather than forcing them to enforce the law on them.\nMost of the ISPs complied except Demon internet. Demon was a British ISP that contributed to the Open Source community, ran several IRC servers and were pioneers of their time. They objected on the grounds of it being \u201cunacceptable censorship\u201d. A few days later, a tabloid expose appeared in the Observer newspaper alleging that the director of Demon was supplying paedophiles with photographs of children being sexually abused.\nThen the police let it be known that during that summer, they were planning a crack-down on an unspecified ISP as a test-case (translation: making an example of them). Between the threats and pressure, the IWF was formed- a supposedly voluntary organisation but in fact a fake-charity and a quango. The IWF is a disgraceful secretive group with an awful corrupt history and no public oversight.\nWe saw the same tactic used against Megaupload. Using the threat of violence to coerce companies, the British police created their own laws. The SOPA legislation did not go their way, so they resulted to immoral tactics of repression.\nGovernment agencies typically create laws through a three pronged attack of creating new legislation, setting court case precedents and putting pressure through regulatory agencies and their state department. A favourite tool of states to repress services is through applied pressure to their payment services. This was the tactic used on Megaupload, Wikileaks and other services.\nPayment services are monopolised in the hands of a few companies. When these companies fail to service someone, it is an effective form of censorship. This censorship becomes particularly odious when it comes to political services like Megaupload or Wikileaks.\nFrom ACTA which is decided behind closed European chambers, the UK\u2019s DEA which was pushed through undemocratically at alarming speed before elections, evil La Hadopi and the failed SOPA/PIPA in the US, there is nowhere to run. The nepotists are determined to push through these legislation. At all costs. This is not about piracy- it never was and will not do a thing. It is about control.\nMega no longer sells accounts directly through their website. To protect themselves you must use one of their 12 resellers (a tactic used by gambling websites). If 11 resellers are attacked, they have one to fall back on; BitVoucher, the Bitcoin reseller. hosting.co.uk started accepting Bitcoin at the end of January but their main form of payment is credit cards and PayPal.\nBitVoucher is a Mega themed site using a newly established payment services company called Zipbit. Zipbit was founded by Bitcoin investor Brian Cartmell in New Zealand, and currently only services New Zealand and Bermuda merchants.\nWordPress wrote:\n\n\u201cPayPal alone blocks access from over 60 countries, and many credit card companies have similar restrictions. Some are blocked for political reasons, some because of higher fraud rates, and some for other financial reasons. Whatever the reason, we don\u2019t think an individual blogger from Haiti, Ethiopia, or Kenya should have diminished access to the blogosphere because of payment issues they can\u2019t control. Our goal is to enable people, not block them.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is more than drugs, sex and criminal gangsters. It is a tool for freedom and speech. To empower good citizens to participate in the economy as equals without censorship and unfair constraints that do more harm than good. Mega\u2019s acceptance is a small but important step towards the free monetary future. TEST", "year": 2013, "month": 2, "day": 17}

We have seen BitPay grow from near-irrelevance to processing transactions for over 2000 merchants around the world, Coinabul expand its gold-selling business from nothing in October 2011 toover 120,000 BTC of gold sold this year, entirely new Bitcoin-accepting businesses likeCoindl andthe Bitcoin Store open their doors, and hundreds more innovative services, of which there are unfortunately far too many to mention. Of course, life in the Bitcoin world has been far from perfect. We saw the margin trading service Bitcoinicacome crashing down after a series of hacks, all in the tens of thousands of BTC in size, a Ponzi scheme grow to a size of $5 million at its peak beforecollapsing in August, and Bitcoin exchangeBitfloor lose $250,000 to another thief in September. However, after these events, the Bitcoin community has begun to take security much more seriously and, among other security upgrades, policies of keeping at least 85% of customers\u2019 assets in offline cold storage have become an industry standard for Bitcoin exchanges. Scams too have become much more difficult to pull off. Also, in the last two months alone, Bitcoin has gained a large amount of public legitimacy, as popular services likeWordPress and4Chan began accepting it, and Bitcoin Central partnered with a licensed payment services provider in France to integrate its exchange accountsdirectly into the traditional banking system. And, last but not least, the Bitcoin price itself increased from $4.72 on Jan 1 to $13.51 on Dec 31, a 186% increase.\nNow that 2012 is behind us, it\u2019s time to start looking forward to what the Bitcoin community will bring in 2013. There are a considerable number of projects scheduled for release this year. A few of the projects, like ASIC mining computers, have simply been delayed from last year, some are services that accept Bitcoin, several provide ways to use Bitcoin more securely, and still others are new projects entirely. Here is a short list of what 2013 has in store.\nASICs \u2013 Butterfly Labs first opened preordering for its upcoming line of application-specific integrated circuit-based mining hardwarein June, originally planning to release them in fall 2012. The mining chips use hardware optimized to perform the sole task of carrying out the SHA256 calculations that make up the bulk of Bitcoin mining, and will thus be able to crank out ten times as much hash power per dollar of hardware and per dollar of electricity compared to FPGA or GPU-based solutions. However, a series of delays has pushed the shipping of these devices to the first quarter of this year. Other companies are rapidly catching up; Avalon ASIC has boldly put down a countdownon their website until the time that they ship, which they have scheduled for January 19, and DeepBit\u2019s own ASICs are stillscheduled for March. Once these devices are released, the Bitcoin network\u2019s hashpower is projected to increase by a factor of ten, making the network extremely robust against attacks from traditional, general-purpose supercomputing networks.Bitcoin Wireless \u2013 ThisBitInstant project intends to provide a way of buying credits for prepaid cellphone and data plans from over 300 carriers around the world at competitive prices. The project was announced months ago and has been followed by near-silence since then, but it is still under development and will likely come out soon.The Bitcoin Debit Card \u2013 Although BitInstant\u2019s plan for aBitcoin-backed debit card originally announced in August has been delayed by months after its original scheduled release date in October, the project is still in the works. And if BitInstant\u2019s card takes too long, the Bitcoin Central exchange in France, armed with many of the powers of a bank through their recentpartnership with the licensed payment services provider Aqoba, is planning to release one of their own as well.Ripple \u2013 This project is anotherbank-free payment network that operates on principles somewhat different from Bitcoin. Ripple seeks to exploit the concept ofsix degrees of separation: that any two people in the world are connected through a chain of relationships that is, on average, only six links long. When one person wants to pay a given amount of money to another, the system finds such a chain between the two people, and registers a debt owed by each person in the chain to the one after them. Thus, everyone gains a credit and a debt within the system, except for the sender and receiver, who are the only ones who see a net increase or reduction to their balance. Friends and colleagues can always settle debts between each other, and Ripple seeks to leverage these relationships to enable payments between any two people in the network without ever moving any actual money. The project has been around for years, but recentlythere have been telltale signs that something is brewing. It looks like the Bitcoin community will have to wait and see to find out what Ripple has in store.BitMessage \u2013This project by Jonathan Warren aims to use many of Bitcoin\u2019s ideas tocreate a secure, decentralized protocol for sending messages. Like Bitcoin, BitMessage uses a peer-to-peer network to propagate information, but unlike Bitcoin, messages only stay in the system to be downloaded by the receiver for two days, limiting the Bitcoin issue of \u201cblockchain bloat\u201d. Version 1.0 turned out to be a flop due to serious security issues, but version 2.0 will switch to a much more secure design based on Bitcoin-like elliptic curve cryptography, as well as being subject to a much more stringent security audit. If BitMessage succeeds, it may well provide a compelling, security and privacy-friendly alternative to thenotoriously insecure email system that we use today.Slush\u2019s USB Hardware Wallet \u2013 In November, Marek Palatinus, operator of the Slush mining pool, announced a project to developa physical Bitcoin wallet device that would take the form of a USB key. Wallet security has been a significant problem for Bitcoin; at one point, a Bitcoin userlost $500,000 when an online attacker managed to gain access to his computer. Since then, Bitcoin clients have added wallet encryption to increase security, which would have prevented the $500,000 loss, but Palatinus intends to go further. With his USB wallet, no private information will ever leave the device; the device outputs transactions signed with its internal private key directly. This, combined with a physical button and display on the wallet that can be configured to be required to press to sign a transaction, ensures that computer intruders or viruses have no way of stealing or emptying the wallet without the user\u2019s express permission. Physical theft will not be a problem either; the wallet will have an option to require a PIN to sign transactions, and the user himself is asked to write the device\u2019s randomly generated root private key down during initialization. Upon losing the device, one can quickly use the key to move all of the stored bitcoins to a temporary location before buying a new one.Multisignature Transactions \u2013 This is a technology that has been available for nearly a year and in the workssince 2011, but which has still seen no significant real-world application. While bitcoins sent to a normal Bitcoin address can only be spent by transactions signed by the one specific private key associated with that address, a multisignature address is associated with N private keys, of which M must be used to sign a transaction spending from that address. N and M can be set to whatever values are necessary. A simple use case is a 2-of-3 wallet for an escrow transaction. For example, suppose Alice wants to buy an expensive product from Bob, but the two do not trust each other. Alice can send the money to a 2-of-3 address with keys controlled by Alice, Bob and a third-party mediator, who is also potentially untrustworthy. Bob sees that the money is in the address and sends off the product. If all goes well and the product arrives, Alice and Bob sign a transaction to send the money locked in the 2-of-3 address to Bob. If the product does not arrive and Bob is unresponsive, Alice can ask the mediator to sign a transaction with her to give her the money back. If the product does arrive and Alice refuses to release the payment, Bob can do the same thing. Finally, if Alice and Bob lose trust in the mediator, they can sign a transaction to send the money to another 2-of-3 address with another mediator. No other mechanism in Bitcoin \u2013 indeed, no other payment system in history \u2013 has the potential to allow this kind of minimal-trust long distance arrangement to take place. The technology also has applications in secure wallets, as one can create 2-of-2 wallets with one key on your machine and the other under the control of a third party, ensuring that anyone wishing to steal your bitcoins must compromise both the provider and your own machine. If the adoption ofdeterministic wallets was the main breakthrough in Bitcoin cryptographic technology in 2012, multisignature transactions may well be the defining development of 2013.Bitcoin Conference \u2013 This year\u2019s Bitcoin conferencewill take place in May in San Jose, California, and will be hosted by the Bitcoin Foundation. This will be the third Bitcoin conference to take place, following one inPrague in November 2011 and another inLondon in September 2012. The topics that will be covered include Bitcoin tech, Bitcoin mining, Bitcoin business and regulatory issues. Hopefully we will be able to see speakers from outside the Bitcoin community too, even if not as many aswe had in 2012; the previous two conferences have turned out to be a great opportunity for fostering dialogue between the Bitcoin community and the internet civil liberties community as a whole.", "year": 2013, "month": 1, "day": 3}
{"title": "ASIC Mining Updates: ASICMiner Deploying, Butterfly At CES", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/asic-mining-updates-asicminer-deploying-butterfly-at-ces-1357664338/", "birthday": "Jan 8, 2013  11:58 AM EST", "date": "2013-01-08 16:58:00", "content": "After over three months of delays from all major competitors, it seems as though the race to develop the first ASIC-based Bitcoin mining computer is finally drawing to a close. Less than three weeks ago, Avalon ASIC announced a hard shipping deadline for themselves of January 19, and placed a countdown on their website. On December 28, another competitor, ASICMiner, published pictures of fully completed mining chips, and on January 3, their PR representative published a post on the Bitcointalk forums: \u201cThe samples passed all functionality tests. The power consumption is also within the expected range. And as our overclocking tests had shown, they still have a lot of potentials compared to our original spec. This means that the biggest risk of our project is gone and our NRE is a fruitful spend. The first production batch of chips will be out of the packaging service tomorrow. Our deploying is on its way.\u201d\nButterfly Labs, the company that originally started the current rush toward ASIC development with its announcement in June, is intent not to fall behind. Today, Butterfly Labs is unveiling a prototype (pictured) of its ASIC miner at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where it is sharing a booth with BitPay. The device has an Android Nexus 7 tablet incorporated.\nOut of the four major competitors, ASICMiner has a business model that is different from the others: while Butterfly Labs, Avalon and BTCFPGA are all seeking to make money by selling their ASICs, ASICMiner intends to keep all of its ASICs in-house, instead gaining the initial capital needed to develop their product by selling shares. The shares were originally released in August on the (now-defunct) Global Bitcoin Stock Exchange, opening up 7.5% of the company\u2019s future profits to investors at a valuation of 40,000 BTC for the entire company. The offering was a success, selling out within days. However, the setup proved to be problematic when the GLBSE unexpectedly shut down, with the result that the company had no way of knowing who its investors were. ASICMiner did finally receive the shareholder database from the GLBSE in December, and shares will once again start trading and paying dividends on a yet-unspecified alternate platform soon.\nAs of today, the four main contenders in the race are:\nAvalon ASICs, offering 60 GH/s for $1,299. These are scheduled to come out on Jan 19, and Avalon stated on Jan 9 that this continues to be the expected deadline. Updates on Avalon can be found here.Butterfly Labs, offering the 60 GH/s Single SC for $1,299. These are likely to come out arund the same time as Avalon, although certainly not by the 14th.BTCPFGA\u2019s bASIC, offering the 72 GH/s bASIC NextGen Bitcoin Miner for $1,069. Unfortunately, BTCFPGA has been suffering serious delays, and its projected shipping data now appears to be the second half of March.ASICMiner, not offering any physical product, but expected to contribute at least 2.8 terahashes, and likely more, to the 23-terahash Bitcoin network.\nOne positive outcome of this stiff competition is that it significantly reduces the chance of any attacks on the Bitcoin network during the transition to ASICs over the next few months. Three months ago, when Butterfly Labs\u2019 Josh Zerlan was asked why he chose the business model of selling his products as opposed to simply mining with them himself, he replied: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we mine with our own equipment? Because we believe the best way to secure bitcoin and help it to succeed is to get as much product out to as many people as widely as possible. That makes it exceptionally difficult, if not impossible, for any individual, corporation or hostile government to destabilize and wreck Bitcoin from within.\u201d When he said this, however, almost everyone was fully expecting that Butterfly Labs would be the first to come out with ASIC hardware, and have a monopoly over it for possibly even over a month, and so the worry that Butterfly Labs would attempt to use its mining power to attack the network was prevalent. Now, however, there are a number of providers, all coming out with ASICs around the same time.\nThus, neither Butterfly Labs nor Avalon, BTCFPGA or ASICMiner will have a particularly long window of time within which to build up enough hashing power to attempt a 51% attack. For those who are interested in seeing when ASICs start coming online in significant numbers, the best place to watch is the Bitcoin network charts at Bitcoin Watch. Once Butterfly, Avalon and BTFPGA customers and ASICMiner turn their entire first batch of computers on, the network hashrate is expected to skyrocket. ASIC mining computers are ten times more efficient than the semi-specialized FPGA machines that came before them, and even more efficient than GPUs. By the time the dust settles, we may be looking at hash rates well in excess of 100 terahashes per second \u2013 making what is already the most powerful distributed computing network ever to have existed even faster.", "year": 2013, "month": 1, "day": 8}
{"title": "Review of AcceptBit: The Trust-Free Payment Processor", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/review-of-acceptbit-the-trust-free-payment-processor-1357337085/", "birthday": "Jan 4, 2013  5:04 PM EST", "date": "2013-01-04 22:04:00", "content": "Joining the ranks of Coinbase, MtGox and Blockchain, Bitcoin developers Stefan Thomas and Jeremias Kangas have released a lightweight Bitcoin payment processor of his own, with a twist: you do not have to trust it to use it. The way that all other payment processors to date have kept track of individual orders is by creating a unique address for each payment, and forwarding any payments that they receive to the merchant. This does prevent the main issue with not bothering with payment processors and instead just having a single address \u2013 namely, that if you receive a payment you have no way to tell who sent it, but it also presents a trust problem: the merchant must trust the processor to hand back the bitcoins. Although over the normal course of business the incentives are aligned for the processor to do just that, as otherwise the merchant would immediately abandon the processor and the processor would lose that merchant\u2019s revenue forever, in reality merchants\u2019 revenues are often not a smooth daily trickle. For example, when Butterfly Labs opened up their ASIC mining computers to pre-orders this June, they received $250,000 in a single day. One can easily see how a merchant might be uncomfortable with trusting a third party with such a large windfall.\nOne solution is for the merchant to provide a few hundred addresses controlled by himself for the payment processor to use, but that requires the merchant to constantly have to replenish the processor\u2019s database with new addresses. One could give more addresses at a time, and release an automatic script for generating addresses and including them in one\u2019s wallet, but the problem remains that either the merchant must at some point replenish the processor\u2019s address database, a concept foreign to any other payment system used today, or the initial database would have to be impractically large. In order for such a setup to work nicely, the merchant would have to somehow give an infinite number of addresses to the payment processor at the same time \u2013 in a finite amount of data. AcceptBit, in effect, does exactly that.\nExplaining how AcceptBit does such a thing requires a basic knowledge of the mathematical properties of Bitcoin\u2019s elliptic curve cryptgraphy. A private key in Bitcoin, used to sign transactions, is a number roughly between 0 and 2256. A public key is a point, with coordinates (x,y) both in approximately the same range. Elliptic curve mathematics has an operation of \u201cadding\u201d two points to generate a third point, such that this addition satisfies the standard mathematical properties of commutativity and associativity (ie. a+b = b+a and a+(b+c) = (a+b)+c). Thus, you can \u201cmultiply\u201d a point by a number by repeatedly adding it to itself (or more efficiently with the double-and-add algorithm), and this multiplication is also associative. The elliptic curve standard also defines a specific point (Gx,Gy) as the \u201cbase point\u201d, the values of which can be looked up in Bitcoin source code or the SEC2 specification. A public key in Bitcoin, from which Bitcoin addresses are derived, is simply the base point multiplied by the private key. It turns out that there is no known way of determining the private key corresponding to a given public key in less than about 2128operations (at current levels of computing power, longer than the lifetime of the universe), and this is part of the basis of Bitcoin\u2019s security. There exist operations of \u201csigning\u201d a message and \u201cverifying\u201d a signature for a given message such that signing requires a private key and verifying requires the corresponding public key. Public keys are, as their name implies, public, and so the entire Bitcoin network can verify that the owner of a given address actually signed transactions that appear to be spending from that address by verifying the signatures with the address\u2019s corresponding public key.\nAcceptBit takes advantage of the \u201cmultiplication\u201d operation that elliptic curve mathematics allows. It asks you to take a root private key, which you keep to yourself, and multiply it by the base point to generate a root public key, which you submit to AcceptBit. AcceptBit can generate new addresses by multiplying the root public key by a given number, for which you can generate the private key, and therefore spend from, by multiplying your root private key by the same number. AcceptBit can keep multiplying the key by different numbers to generate new addresses, so the number of addresses that they have is basically infinite. However, AcceptBit can only watch the addresses that it generates; it cannot spend from them \u2013 solving the payment processor trust problem.\nThis is not a new idea; the concept has already been implemented in the popular Bitcoin client Electrum and is formalized in the BIP 0032 specification. However, AcceptBit is the first service that makes use of it to do something that would not be possible without it. For now, the only wallet that includes built-in support for the specification is Electrum, and so an Electrum wallet is currently required to use AcceptBit.\nAcceptBit has a simple form where you fill in your business\u2019s name and your root public key from Electrum (obtained with electrum get master_public_key), and you can start generating invoices immediately. The form for generating an invoice is simple; just fill in a currency amount, a currency (with dozens to choose from) and click \u201cCreate\u201d. You then get a payment page containing an address to pay to and a QR code to scan, and which shows the status of the transaction: unpaid, paid or confirmed. The main page also shows a list of all invoices that have been generated, allowing you to see which of them have been paid.\nHowever, there are a few features which are still lacking from the service. One major weakness is a lack of automatic updating for the payment pages. Currently, in order to see whether an invoice has been paid or not you need to refresh the payment page. The service would become much more usable if it included a script which checks for payment every couple of seconds and updates the page automatically. Another flaw is its lack of an API. The only way to generate invoices is to fill in the form on your main merchant page; there is no convenient way to generate invoices automatically. Of course, one can hack one\u2019s way around the restriction by filling in the form automatically; the command line script for this is \u201d wget --header 'Cookie: csrftoken=0' http://acceptbit.com/m/3psKTF6icX2GU9Beo1PPgb --post-data 'csrfmiddlewaretoken=0&currency_amount=0.1&currency=USD' \u201c, substituting in your own merchant page and desired amount. However, this is far from convenient, and there is no way to keep track of invoices that is convenient for an automated script either. Thus, using AcceptBit to accept payments on one\u2019s website is currently difficult.\nIf AcceptBit implements these missing features, it can become a competitive means of accepting payments even for those who are willing to trust an established third party merchant provider. It and Blockchain are the only two providers that do not require any kind of account to use, and right now Blockchain mirrors its weaknesses; although its merchant system has an exemplary interface for automated scripts, its operators have not seen a need to develop any merchant interface for human beings. Blockchain also has another weakness: less privacy. Because its merchant system requires you to specify a specific address to send bitcoins to, unless you specify a list of a hundred addresses to randomly choose from all of your customers\u2019 payments will be collected in one place. AcceptBit, on the other hand, has the ability to generate new addresses that belong to you with every invoice, solving this problem. Although AcceptBit\u2019s model of providing addresses that are already directly under the merchant\u2019s control does mean that it will never be able to match BitPay and WalletBit\u2019s offerings to convert earnings directly into fiat currency deposited in the merchant\u2019s bank account, for those merchants who simply want an easy-to-use, hassle-free solution with minimal setup required AcceptBit definitely has the potential to become the best choice.", "year": 2013, "month": 1, "day": 4}
