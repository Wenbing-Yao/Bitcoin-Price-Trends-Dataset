Also, the bitcoin price here is much higher than the international market price,\" said Liang.\nBitKan, which\u00a0began offering over-the-counter (OTC) trading earlier this year, noted Bitcoin's big potential in India, stating that the country does represent an interesting market. BitKan, a Shenzhen-based bitcoin startup, provides an all-in-one application with real-time news feeds, price monitoring and alerts, as well as a bitcoin wallet. BitKan's OTC trading platform supports 15 currencies including INR, USD, CNY and RUB. The company\u00a0raised $1.6 million from bitcoin mining giant Bitmain back in April.\nGiven India's underdeveloped banking system and the unstable monetary policies, Bitcoin represents a good alternative for locals, Liang said.\nAs India tries to crack down on corruption and \"black money,\" the announcement in November that large notes were no longer legal tender, increased sales volume for bitcoin on several exchanges. Queries for bitcoins went up by 20 percent to 30 percent in the days that followed the news, according to ZebPay, a local Bitcoin exchange platform.\n\"People who never talked about bitcoins called me,\" Saurabh Agrawal, CEO and co-founder of Zebpay,\u00a0told the Hindustan Times. \"Financial companies also want to invest in bitcoin. That's a big change in a country where bitcoins have never taken off.\"\nZebPay added 50,000 news users in November, more than doubling the company's normal rate of 20,000 new users per month. \"Our trade volume in November touched INR 120 crore (US$17.6 million), up by 25 percent compared to October, and our revenue grew 25 percent as well,\" Agrawal\u00a0told the Economic Times in an interview yesterday.\nThis article constitutes sponsored content and as such does not necessarily represent the opinions or any endorsements of or by Bitcoin Magazine, its affiliated publications, staff or parent companies.", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 16}

The Sub-Committee will actively promote blockchain education, it said at the conference.\nLiu Yang, CEO of Shenzhen Digital Singularity (BitKan), told Bitcoin Magazine that industry could greatly benefit from blockchain, which has the potential to significantly streamline logistics and supply chains by cutting out intermediaries and upgrading traditionally paper-based and time-consuming processes for the digital age.\nIn addition to cost savings and greater efficiency, the blockchain could bring an unprecedented level of transparency to all processes by allowing better tracking of orders and assets, reducing errors, and enabling supply chain entities to identify attempted fraud more easily.\n\"The procedures of logistics are so long that problems occur constantly,\" said Yang. \"Problems like losses and cargo shipping mistakes require powerful tracing ability. It is obvious the blockchain technology can perform well for logistics in that regard.\"\nShenzhen Digital Singularity (BitKan), the only blockchain company participating on the Sub-Committee, will work with traditional logistics and supply chain companies to develop comprehensive blockchain solutions that address real problems, the company said. It will also be responsible for setting standards and regulations for the field. Yang said he will run for \u201cthe Presidency of the Standard Committee.\u201d\nSupply chain needs in China have changed dramatically in recent years as China has shifted from being an underdeveloped manufacturing country to becoming a world leader in exports.\nChina overtook Japan as the leading Asian exporter in 2004, three years after its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). The country surpassed the United States in 2007 and Germany in 2009 to become the world's leading exporter.\nIn 2012, China's merchandise exports accounted for 12 per cent of the world's trade merchandise exports,\u00a0according to the WTO.\nBlockchain for Financial Supply Chains\nInitially known as the underlying technology powering Bitcoin, the blockchain has caught the attention of the financial services industry, and now the logistics industry, by promising greater efficiency. Applications and use cases for the blockchain have greatly expanded beyond Bitcoin, Yang said.\nYet, the blockchain is in its infancy, he acknowledged, and players are still exploring the opportunities and challenges related to the technology.\nNevertheless, Yang believes that in the near future, \"the perfect combination of blockchain technology and logistics industry will tackle the financial hindrances in logistics, and significantly improve efficiency.\"\nThe Sub-Committee said it is working on a \"blockchain-based company credit mechanism.\" The system would use blockchain to \"tag and anchor the credit rating of supply chain companies.\"\nThe group said it will be targeted at small and medium sized companies which cannot rely on traditional lenders for loans. Big corporations impose tough payment terms on smaller vendors, forcing them to wait for weeks, if not months, before being paid.\n\"On-credit orders are a big concern for the industry. Upper stream companies cannot receive timely payments from big companies. A one month of delay is commonly seen,\" Yang said.\n\"That's why small companies are struggling. Banks will simply turn away: they need factories and warehouses as collateral. Blockchain technology, however, can help by making company financials transparent to the extent that the financial institutions can understand their operational status thus, ultimately, removing the hindrance for loan.\"\nFounded in 2013, Shenzhen Digital Singularity (BitKan) was launched by former employees of China-based IT and internet giants, Huawei and Tencent. The company operates\u00a0BitKan, a popular all-in-one app that lets users track bitcoin\u2019s price, set alerts, keep up with industry news and trade bitcoins\u00a0over-the-counter.\nThis article constitutes sponsored content and as such does not necessarily represent the opinions or any endorsements of or by Bitcoin Magazine, its affiliated publications, staff or parent companies.", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 21}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nYours is an upcoming social media application that intends to bridge the gap between content and payments. The system uses bitcoin micropayments (via a system similar to the Lightning Network) to allow users to send money to each other.\nCreating a new social media platform powered by bitcoin is not a new concept. Zapchain and ChangeTip tried to build businesses around the concept of \u201csocial tipping\u201d in the past, but neither project was able attain a large amount of success.\n\u201cThe problem with tipping is that most people just don\u2019t tip,\u201d explained Yours CEO Ryan X. Charles on the latest episode of Blocktalk. \u201cIt\u2019s not very incentivizing to tip people. Some people do it, but you\u2019re almost certainly not going to earn a living from just waiting for people to voluntarily give you money just because they like you.\u201d\nThe Yours team is currently working on finding the right combination of incentive structures to bring together content creators and their paying audience members. Charles explained three possible content monetization models during his recent appearance on Blocktalk.\nThe Endorsement Model\nThe first way described by Charles that content creators could get paid on the Yours platform was through what he called the endorsement model. The idea is that those who are endorsing content via the Yours equivalent of Reddit upvotes or Facebook likes will pay a few cents to the content creator for each endorsement; however, the content creator only receives half of the funds attached to each endorsement (except for the first one), and all of the previous endorsers receive the other half.\nCharles explained the benefits of the endorsement model:\n\u201cFirst of all, it rewards the content creator. Secondly, it encourages people to endorse content because if you\u2019re good at it and you are one of the first endorsers on something that becomes popular, you will profit from doing so.\u201d\n\u201cIt gives a profit motive for endorsing content,\u201d added Charles.\nBlocktalk host Alex Sterk pointed out that the endorsement model sounds similar to a multi-level marketing (MLM) scheme, and Charles agreed that it may be similar to some type of MLM or affiliate marketing strategy.\nCharles also admitted the endorsement model is not perfect. \u201cNot everyone can profit,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way this works is if most people are actually losing money. Those people are not going to be very happy about the endorsement model.\u201d\nThe Purchase Model\nThe next content monetization model outlined by Charles was the purchase model. This method is much more straightforward as users are essentially just buying content from other users on the site.\nThe key differentiation here is that users are able to preview a large chunk of the content before paying for it. For example, the writer of a sci-fi novel could allow readers to enjoy the entire book, except for the last chapter, for free. The author could then charge a fee for readers to find out how the story ends in that last chapter.\n\u201cAnybody who actually likes an article and really wants to read what your conclusion is will want to read that last [paragraph],\u201d said Charles.\nCharles noted that there could be a large amount of flexibility offered to users with this method. It can work for basically all different types of content (music, podcasts, articles, books, videos, etc.), and content creators can choose how much to charge and how much of the content they should give away for free.\nThe Investment Model\nThe final content monetization model outlined by Charles during the interview was the investment model. This is an extension of the purchase model that allows users to invest in content creators on Yours. Instead of buying an article for ten cents, a user may decide to invest ten dollars in exchange for a percentage of all future revenues obtained from the article.\nDuring the interview, Charles remained practical in terms of whether or not any of these options will turn out to be the killer use case for Yours. \u201cWhatever we launch will be an experiment,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee that it will actually work. [But] I\u2019m completely convinced some combination of content and payments will work, and it\u2019ll be huge.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 16}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nPublicism, a Dutch social enterprise established earlier this year, wants to leverage the potential of blockchain technology to guarantee press freedom. The initiative is backed by a \u20ac50,000 (~$52,000 U.S.) subsidy from the\u00a0Dutch Journalism Fund (\u201cStimuleringsfonds voor de Journalistiek\u201d), an organization supported by the country\u2019s Ministry of Education, Culture and Science that seeks to stimulate the quality, diversity and independence of journalism.\nPublicism is an initiative of three Dutch media veterans: Pieter Haasnoot, Annemieke Teune and John Oliveira. Concerned by the decline of press freedom around the globe, the team believes blockchain technology could be part of a solution to reverse this trend.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Haasnoot explained:\n\u201cDue to both technical as well as economic factors, freedom of the press is under siege all across the world. Technically, it\u2019s relatively hard for journalists to keep their own data private, as well as data provided by their sources. Economically, a bigger share of the monetization pie ends up in the pockets of internet giants like Google or Facebook, rather than media companies to invest in investigative journalism.\u201d\nPerhaps most importantly, blockchains should be able to offer censorship resistant and immutable broadcasting tools. Of course, technologies like Tor and BitTorrent are out there as well, although \u201coften not legal or not readily available for those who need them most,\u201d Haasnoot said. \u201cUtilizing the potential currently still requires quite a bit of technical know-how. We can do better.\u201d\nAt the heart of the project, Publicism plans to make these tools easily available for journalists through a convenient dashboard. Publication of stories and also payments and ownership rights will be managed through this dashboard, all the while preserving anonymity for both journalists and their readers.\n\u201cBlockchain technology, or more specifically smart contracts, can be applied to realize micropayments,\u201d Oliveira told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cOr to manage grants or crowdfunding from readers, donors or supporters who themselves wish to remain anonymous \u2014 with no need for middlemen.\u201d\nWhile the mission is clear, Haasnoot, Teune and Oliveira acknowledged they\u2019re still in an exploratory phase to figure how how best to accomplish their goal. Launched as a part-time effort, Publicism has yet to fill in many of the specifics, both on conceptual as well as practical levels. The team recently partnered with World Press Photo and Radboud University Nijmegen to explore different options.\n\u201cWe initially went in a bit naive, and were under the impression that many of the solutions were already out there \u2014 think of\u00a0Decent or\u00a0Steemit,\u201d Haasnoot admitted. \u201cAs we learned more about this technology and these kinds of projects, we found that many of them were still trying to figure out the answers themselves, and several seemed primarily focused on making money from some kind of token-scheme.\u201d\nTo turn Publicism into a real product, the team for now primarily focuses on\u00a0Hyperledger, which Haasnoot, Teune and Oliveira consider a good environment for learning the basics of blockchain technology and experimenting. For future stages, Publicism may consider other blockchains, like Bitcoin, possibly in combination with the Ethereum-like\u00a0Rootstock sidechain. A proof of concept for Publicism should be finished by February, while a minimum viable product is scheduled for July.\nPublicism is open to tips or any other information that may be helpful to their cause.

However, as a young nonprofit working with a nascent technology, time was needed for the technology and BitGive to mature.\n\u201cAfter accomplishing some early goals and building strong partnerships, we felt ready to tackle this last year and started out on the journey with our charity partner, The Water Project,\u201d said Gallippi.\nAs an early adopter integrating bitcoin into its fundraising options in 2014, Peter Chasse, the president and founder of The Water Project, has built his organization in a transparent and accountable manner, while also being equally interested in building a platform that leveraged aspects of bitcoin, said Gallippi.\n\u201cWe recognized early on, alongside BitGive, that the blockchain provides a whole new way to allow confidence-inspiring real-time auditing of how organizations like ours spend the public\u2019s donations,\u201d said Chasse. \u201cGiveTrack will allow charities to prove, in an approachable way, what they\u2019ve been doing all along, namely providing sustainable, cost-effective solutions to people who need them the most.\u201d\nDespite working with other prominent nonprofits such as Save the Children, TECHO, Fundaci\u00f3n Parlas and Team Rubicon, BitGive has limited the initial launch of GiveTrack to The Water Project and Medic Mobile, an organization that works in 23 countries around the world and supports over 13,000 health workers. \u00a0BitGive and its community-based fundraising campaign raised enough funds to support Medic Mobile\u2019s new programs in Nepal with 640 new phones for health workers.\nAt present BitGive wants to ensure that the platform runs smoothly, and to work out any potential issues before opening it up to additional organizations. The long-term plan is to have as many organizations as possible on the platform as it continues to grow.\n\u201cThe goal with developing GiveTrack is to provide a solution for nonprofits to offer transparency to their donors, thereby building trust and hopefully gaining more support toward their mission and work,\u201d said Gallippi.\nBy leveraging blockchain technology, GiveTrack delivers a level of confidence to donors who will be able to see the status of their contribution from the initial donation to the allocation and deployment phases of funds. By giving donors a blockchain-based platform through which they can receive status updates and trace the pathway of their funds, donors will have peace of mind, knowing that their donation has been received by the charity in real time while always maintaining confidentiality.\nBitcoin\u2019s Impact on Charities\nImplicitly, Bitcoin offers faster and more secure transactions for lower fees. As Gallippi notes, this is especially helpful for organizations like The Water Project, who have most of their work in Africa and need to move significant funds there on a regular basis.\n\u201cCryptographically secure, cross-border transactions in just minutes with minimal fees is a very significant improvement to current methods,\u201d said Gallippi. \u201cBanks and wire-transfer services take days or even up to a week to move funds, can charge up to 13 percent or more, and are vulnerable to fraud.\u201d\nAnd yet, with the launch of GiveTrack and the transparency aspects of bitcoin, BitGive can offer real-time accountability for organizations to offer their donors and build trust and drive more impact.", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 19}

I am fortunate enough to live in one of Africa\u2019s advanced economies, South Africa, where I am based in Johannesburg, the continent\u2019s pride and joy. This is where thousands of Africans migrate every year from all over the continent to earn a living. The city has every first world facility you can think of \u2014 like high speed trains, world-class airports and some of the globe\u2019s best sporting facilities. It was the only city in Africa to host a FIFA World Cup Final in 2010. It\u2019s sad that, despite this, African people still know very little of digital currencies and blockchain \u2014 even bitcoin, which has been in existence over seven years now.\nI interviewed Zimbabwean immigrant Lovemore Tavengwa at the bustling Johannesburg park station in the city centre where he works as a hawker, wanting to know about how he and other Zimbabweans send money to their loved ones back home.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough situation,\u201d Tavengwa laments. His country uses the U.S. dollar, South African rand and the Chinese yuan as currencies. \u201cYou see, most of us are unbanked in South Africa and in Zimbabwe. So we use payment methods like Western Union and others. The problem is the fees are high. So the best thing for us is to carry the cash when we go home, or ask a bus driver or anyone going home to courier it for us. This has resulted in monies being lost along the way.\u201d\nWhen I asked if he knew anything about bitcoin, he said he had little knowledge and believed bitcoin was used only to participate in Ponzi schemes. \u201dI\u2019m still skeptical about that,\u201d he said. He did, however, tell me that he would welcome any payment method that would ensure his loved ones received their money safely and quickly.\nTavengwa is not the only one who is still misinformed about bitcoin and how it works. Most people in South Africa and the rest of Africa are still in the dark about it, from university students to professionals. I\u2019ve asked people in shopping malls, gyms and churches about their knowledge of bitcoin and discovered that a vast majority of them didn\u2019t have any idea what I was talking about.\nIt\u2019s not all doom and gloom though. South African startup Bitbuybit, based in the capital city of Tshwane/Pretoria, is seeing an increase in bitcoin awareness. Established in May 2015, Bitbuybit is an educational programme designed to educate the general population of South Africa and its neighboring countries keen to learn more about bitcoin and other digital currencies. I spoke to its founder, Reuel Leach, who also runs South Africa\u2019s first bitcoin shop.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about educating people about bitcoin,\u201d Leach enthused. \u201cWhen we started, we attracted interest from a variety of people. There were entrepreneurs who were just interested in making money out of bitcoin when it gains value. We also had people who were enticed to join Ponzi schemes using the currency, but had no idea of how it works, and there those who just wanted to learn,\u201d he said. \u201cSoon the auditoriums were packed, week in, week out, and we were overwhelmed by interest from the media and people in general who wanted to know just how legitimate the digital currency is.\u201d\nAnd then there is BitPesa, a universal payment and trading platform founded in Nairobi, Kenya, in 2013. Focusing on business-to-business customers, it allows users to convert digital currencies, such as bitcoin, into local currencies. BitPesa now operates in Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda and Tanzania. Anyone in these countries can trade with businesses around the globe using BitPesa.\nDevelopments like BitPesa and Bitmari, which allows users to trade with each other in their native languages while helping female farmers in Zimbabwe, are indeed beacons of hope for Africa.\nWe need, however, more awareness campaigns to educate people about bitcoin. The African continent needs needs more initiatives like the Blockchain & Bitcoin Africa Conference, which held its inaugural event in Cape Town in 2015. With the Bitcoin ecospace now safer than before \u2014 with the availability of bitcoin safes like Trezor, for instance \u2014 I don\u2019t see a reason why we shouldn\u2019t adopt bitcoin for use in large numbers.\nFormer South African president, Thabo Mbeki, an economist and a staunch proponent of ideas for an African Renaissance, once suggested that Africa should develop its own currency, which could be used in all African states like the euro is used in Europe. This was welcomed as a brilliant idea by many, but never came to fruition. Now, I\u2019m not suggesting bitcoin be the \u201cAfrican currency,\u201d but if it were, it would improve millions of lives on the continent and create opportunities.\nThis op-ed is a guest post by Zama Dyani.

And yet, for many in the extreme-sports world, the digital currency provides the perfect avenue for funding and exposure.\nTake motorcycle racing and paragliding. Two completely different sports, but they have one thing in common: bitcoin.\nParaglider Rhys Fisher is not your normal 9-to-5 kind of guy. U.K.-born, the 26-year-old professional pilot is blazing an uncommon trail and attempting to demonstrate that bitcoin is a viable solution for extreme sports.\nBrought up amongst the vineyards of southeast Spain from the age of 12, Fisher returned to the U.K. in 2008 at the age of 18 during the economic collapse. Within two months, though, he was back in Spain, up north, working for Ryanair as one of the cabin crew. However, after a few years, the bug to move on returned, which saw him landing a job in Belgium.\nDuring this time, though, he admits that he struggled to find the time for paragliding. Eventually, he decided to leave his demanding job and put his passion first and focus on his first love of gliding through the air.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Fisher said that he\u2019s been finding freelance work along his journey, sometimes pursuing more entrepreneurial projects.\n\u201c[This] eventually led me to launching the Thermal Crossings project, which is my attempt to rewrite the adventurers\u2019 rule book.\u201d\nThermal Crossings is an experiment to explore crowdfunded sports expeditions from training to the final trip. According to Fisher, he hasn\u2019t seen anyone do anything like it before, which he believes is similar to Bitcoin: new, relies on technology and demonstrates the power of the people.\nCurrently based in Algodonales, Spain, Fisher has always been passionate about technology, more specifically the internet. It wasn\u2019t until this year, however, that he had the opportunity to meet a friend who set him up with his first bitcoin wallet and bitcoins.\nKeen to learn more about the digital currency and what it can do for extreme sports such as paragliding, Fisher undertook an experiment.\nAt 4,000 feet, Fisher demonstrated to another paragliding pilot he was introducing bitcoin to that he could make a mobile top-up anywhere with Bitrefill.\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m crossing mountain ranges with my paraglider, having mobile credit in an emergency provides an important safety margin,\u201d Fisher said. \u201c[As] paragliders have a very narrow weather window, when the weather conditions are flyable, I want to be in the air, not waiting for mobile top-up stations to open.\u201d\nTo pull off the experiment in flight, Fisher switched on his SkyDrop \u2014 a GPS device \u2014 and took off from El Buey, Jumilla, in Spain. Using the thermals to get up to the cloud base, he used the altitude to fly away from the mountain, positioning himself for the good view of the ridge he took off from.\n\u201cThe website worked flawlessly, and the Bitrefill arrived within a few seconds,\u201d he said.\nFor Fisher, bitcoin has provided a simple and effective solution to what was previously a problem for him.\nFor his next adventure, he is raising funds for a trip to Nepal and India next spring. It will require over 16 bitcoins to take him and his team there, and he intends to explore and demonstrate the possibilities with bitcoin.\nBy embracing the digital currency as a viable travel currency, Fisher wants to highlight what it truly means to leave behind the comforts of fiat currency while pursuing extreme adventures.\n\u201cI\u2019m always finding new services that make it more useful as a currency, and can\u2019t help but think it\u2019s the money of choice for living an agile existence,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cI could never imagine that a currency that isn\u2019t backed by a government or bank could work, but it does, and it works well.\u201d\nIsle of Man TT\nWhen you think of the Isle of Man TT, the international motorcycle sport event held every year on the island situated in the Irish Sea between England and Ireland, you don\u2019t necessarily equate it with bitcoin.\nAnd yet, CoinCorner, the Isle of Man\u2013based bitcoin-solutions provider, is changing that. In 2015 and 2016, CoinCorner sponsored ten-time TT winner \u201cFlying Kiwi\u201d Bruce Anstey. During the event, Anstey sported the CoinCorner logo and the Bitcoin logo on his helmet.\nThe Isle of Man is known as \u201cBitcoin Island,\u201d and Bitcoin Magazine caught up with Molly Spiers, marketing manager at CoinCorner, who said that as a local business CoinCorner is keen to support its local community.\n\u201cThe added benefit of sponsoring the Isle of Man TT is that it now has a large global audience and is viewed by millions of people on TV and online, so we can get global exposure for bitcoin and CoinCorner at the same time as sponsoring a local event,\u201d said Spiers.\nWhile it\u2019s true that Anstey may know more about motorbikes than bitcoin, CoinCorner was keen to support a local event and, in particular, someone who has similar characteristics to their business: polite, calm, but with a cold hard determination to succeed. According to Spiers, Anstey embodies these characteristics.\nSpiers states that just like the TT, bitcoin will continue to grow as more people adopt it for online transactions and cross-border payments.\n\u201cThe TT has grown from humble beginnings to become a global phenomenon with a huge online presence that attracts visitors from all over the world, [so] the parallels between the TT and bitcoin are easy to draw.\u201d\nThe 2017 Isle of Man TT has the potential to further highlight the positive impact bitcoin can have on the public. With many people\u2019s trust in the banking system diminishing, bitcoin provides them with the ideal avenue to essentially become their own banks, reducing reliance on the traditional banking systems.\n\u201cIf the Bitcoin logo is increasingly seen in public, it will reinforce the idea that bitcoin as a currency is here to stay,\u201d added Spiers. \u201cPeople will gain comfort from the fact that the Bitcoin brand is growing.\u201d\nWatch Rhys Fisher\u2019s mobile top-up at 4,000 feet:\n", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 19}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nWhile Silk Road popularized the industry back in 2011, AlphaBay is the now the most widely used darknet market in existence. Usage statistics are hard to come by when it comes to Tor hidden services, but in an interview with Deep Dot Web earlier this year, the site\u2019s head administrator claimed many vendors from the now-defunct Evolution marketplace have moved over to AlphaBay.\nThe popularity of AlphaBay is also obvious on the darknet markets subreddit, a popular forum of choice for those who shop on the darknet.\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to AlphaBay to get their thoughts on Bitcoin scaling and two privacy-focused altcoins: Monero and Zcash.\nOn Bitcoin Congestion\nMany Bitcoin-related companies have had to deal with an increase in support tickets due to the increased congestion on the network this past year, and AlphaBay has not been spared this headache. \u201cIt has become an issue when there is [a] backlog on the blockchain, as many newbie users complain about missing deposits while they are in fact unconfirmed,\u201d a member of the AlphaBay support team told Bitcoin Magazine.\nAlthough various improvements to privacy and scalability were discussed at a Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Milan this past October, AlphaBay does not currently have any plans to run a Tumblebit hub or a Lightning Network node. \u201cWe have our own proprietary tumbling platform,\u201d said the support representative.\nIt should be noted that the code for these projects are still works in progress. While the upcoming social media app Yours has implemented their own micropayments solution, a more elegant version of the Lightning Network will be possible if or when Segregated Witness is activated on the network. Tumblebit does not require any changes to the Bitcoin protocol, although it would be improved by Segregated Witness. At least two implementations are currently in development.\nAre AlphaBay Users Paying with Monero?\nAfter AlphaBay and Oasis (another darknet market) integrated Monero payments in late August, the market cap of Monero grew from around $25 million to over $170 million in a couple of weeks. The market cap has now settled around $110 million.\nWhile Oasis appears to have pulled an exit scam (they ran away with users\u2019 money) since their Monero announcement, AlphaBay is still alive and kicking. An AlphaBay support representative told Bitcoin Magazine that Monero accounts for 2 percent of AlphaBay\u2019s business.\nAccording to MoneroStats, there were less than 500 transactions per day on the Monero network before the darknet markets took an interest in the Bitcoin alternative. Now, there is usually three times that amount. It\u2019s unclear how much of that transaction growth is due to real usage and how much is an increased number of speculators moving their coins between exchanges.\nZcash Worth Consideration\nZcash has launched since AlphaBay adopted Monero, and many are wondering if this could be the next altcoin tested out by the darknet markets. The Zcash market cap is currently less than a tenth of Monero\u2019s.\nWhen asked whether AlphaBay will adopt Zcash, a support representative told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cIn the future we might. It looks like a good alternative.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 21}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin right now is\u00a0not really anonymous. Monitoring of the unencrypted peer-to-peer network and analysis of the public blockchain, combined with Know Your Customer (KYC) policies and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulation, can reveal a lot about who is using Bitcoin and for what.\nThis is not great from a privacy perspective. For example, Bitcoin users might not necessarily want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own; similarly, businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors.\nAnd the fact that the transaction history of each bitcoin is traceable puts the\u00a0fungibility of all bitcoins at risk. \u201cTainted\u201d bitcoins may be valued less than other bitcoins, possibly even calling into question bitcoin's value proposition as money.\nBut this can be improved. Perhaps one of the most promising solutions is designed to be an integral part of one of Bitcoin\u2019s highly anticipated scaling layers: the\u00a0lightning\u00a0network. Utilizing the \u201cSphinx\u201d protocol, lightning payments will be routed over a Tor-like anonymity network to offer privacy and protect fungibility.\nPayment Channels and the Lightning Network: A Brief Recap\nThe lightning network essentially consists of bi-directional payment channels, creating a peer-to-peer network.\nBi-directional payment channels increase privacy even without the lightning network. Two users \u2014 let\u2019s say Alice and Bob \u2014 can open a bi-directional payment channel and transact over this channel through a private medium. Only once they are finished transacting will they broadcast the final state of the channel to the blockchain. This public transaction reveals how much money Alice sent to Bob \u2014 or the other way around. But there is no way to tell whether this was through ten transactions, a hundred small transactions, or maybe even a thousand transactions back and forth. This ambiguity is a boon for privacy.\nUnfortunately, a disadvantage is introduced when these bi-directional payment channels are all linked to create a peer-to-peer network. If Alice pays a third user \u2014 Carol \u2014 through Bob, Bob will know that Alice paid Carol, and how much. While Alice and Carol still have relative privacy in relation to the rest of the world, they do not have privacy in relation to Bob. And if there are two or more intermediaries \u2014 \u00a0not only Bob but also Dan \u2014 both Bob and Dan learn about the transaction between Alice and Carol.\nNot ideal.\nSphinx\nThe current lightning network\u00a0specification includes a solution to mask routing data from all intermediaries, based on Sphinx.\nDesigned by academic researchers, George Danezis and Ian Goldberg, Sphinx is a protocol to relay anonymized messages over a peer-to-peer network. The solution was first\u00a0proposed in May 2009, and had nothing to do with the lightning network or even Bitcoin. It was Lightning Labs\u2019 Olaoluwa Osuntokun who realized Sphinx could be utilized and, in collaboration with Blockstream\u2019s Christian Decker, modified the protocol to better fit the lightning network.\nSphinx shares similarities with the well-known anonymizing communication tool, Tor (the Onion Router). As with Tor, any data package sent with Sphinx \u2014 including the receiving IP address \u2013 is encrypted. This encrypted package is then itself encrypted a couple times over until it consists of several \u201clayers\u201d of encryption (hence the \u201conion\u201d metaphor for Tor).\nUsing clever cryptographic tricks, all these layers of encryption are applied so that each intermediary along a route toward the final destination of the package can unwrap only one layer. This layer reveals to each intermediary where the package must be forwarded to, but nothing else. (Compared to Tor, Sphinx uses improved cryptographic algorithms and creates a constant-size data package to better obfuscate a node\u2019s position in the route.)\nOn lightning, the payer determines a path over the peer-to-peer network and wraps a payment package in layers of encryption. And, apart from just relay information, each intermediary also unpacks some additional data. This includes amounts, fees and more, along with allowing all intermediaries to set up a step in the payment chain. (In a future version of the lightning network, this may be extended with a protocol called \u201cHornet\u201d to further streamline the whole process \u2014 but this is not strictly needed for the lightning network to function.)\nImportantly, all intermediaries only learn from which channel they receive bitcoins, and to which channel they must forward the payment. The intermediaries have no idea whether they are the first step in the chain, the last step, a step somewhere in the middle, or perhaps even the only step. Whoever originally sent the transaction, and the one who ultimately receives it, remain known to only the sender and the receiver.\nWhenever channels close, the advantages offered by bi-directional payments channels are clear \u2014 on steroids. While everyone gets to see how many bitcoins Alice sent to Bob over the duration of the channel, again, it remains unknown whether these were ten transactions, a hundred small transactions, or maybe even a thousand transactions back and forth. Moreover, Alice may not even have sent much of the money to Bob at all: perhaps most payments from Alice to Bob were actually routed to Carol, or to someone else, anywhere on the network.\nFor technical details on lightning routing, see\u00a0part four of the lightning network specification as explained by Blockstream\u2019s Rusty Russell, or Olaoluwa Osuntokun\u2019s presentation at Scaling Bitcoin Milan.", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 19}

A pilot project, which will start in the first quarter of 2017 and run for four months, plans to leverage distributed ledger technology to track and trace pork in China and produce in the U.S. \u2014 two high-volume product categories with large markets.\nThis will be one of the first major tests of blockchain distributed ledgers outside the financial services industry. According to the WSJ, blockchain technology can help in overcoming delays and errors, resulting in more streamlined and efficient supply chain management. In fact, the supply chain management sector is a prime target for advanced applications of blockchain technology. Among companies in consumer goods and manufacturing, 42 percent plan to spend at least $5 million on blockchain technology in the next year, according to a Deloitte survey.\nAs explained in a recent Distributed article titled \u201cHow Blockchain Technology Is Reinventing Global Trade Efficiency,\u201d the supply chain sector represents billions of dollars in enterprise revenue, but is fraught with losses and inefficiencies resulting from risk, fraud or anachronistic manual paperwork delays.\nAccording to Frank Yiannas, Vice President of Food Safety at Walmart and leader of the blockchain effort, the pilot project will give Walmart a sense of how blockchain technology works and how well it scales. The main challenge, Yiannas explained, is setting up technology for farmers, field workers and others to collect data and insert it onto a blockchain. Innovative data entry tools running on ubiquitous smartphones, with backends in the cloud, are expected to allow field workers to input relevant data to a blockchain ledger that tracks all data, making it accessible \u201cin minutes, rather than days,\u201d Yiannas said, thereby improving Walmart\u2019s supply chain efficiency, identifying bottlenecks and reducing food waste.\nThe project \u2014 a collaboration between Walmart, IBM and Tsinghua University in Beijing \u2014 was first unveiled in October, when the project partners claimed they were creating a new model for food traceability, supply chain transparency and auditability. \u201cBy harnessing the power of blockchain technology designed to generate transparency and efficiency in supply chain record keeping, this work aims to help enhance the safety of food on the tables of Chinese consumers,\u201d noted an IBM press release. In fact, the pilot project was initially planned to track and trace Chinese pork; U.S. produce was added later.\nThe technical platform that Walmart will use is based on IBM\u2019s blockchain technology developed for the Linux Foundation, Hyperledger fabric. An open source blockchain technology intended as a foundation for developing blockchain applications, the platform has modular architecture that allows for plug-and-play components, such as smart contract, consensus and membership services. In September, IBM unveiled a collaboration with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (BTMU), which leverages the same technology to automate and streamline business transactions.\n\u201cAs advocates of promoting greater transparency in the food system for our customers, we look forward to working with IBM and Tsinghua University to explore how this technology might be used as a more effective food traceability solution,\u201d said Yiannas.\n\u201cAdvanced technology has reached into so many aspects of modern life but it has lagged in food traceability, and in particular in creating more secure food supply chains. Our collaboration with Walmart and Tsinghua University is a step of global significance to change that,\u201d added Bridget van Kralingen, Senior Vice President, Industry Platforms, IBM. \u201cFood touches all of us, everywhere, so we are experimenting in China with Walmart and Tsinghua, given the size and scale of food consumption in this country.\u201d\nThe Walmart pilot project will use transaction security and authentication technology developed by Tsinghua University, \u201cChina\u2019s rapid economic growth has led to massive opportunities for innovation, but it has also presented quality of life challenges, including helping to assure that food sold in the country is safe to eat,\u201d said Tsinghua professor Chai Yueting from the National Engineering Laboratory for E-Commerce Technologies.\nChai added that Tsinghua University is also committed to in-depth research of food safety \u2014 one of the most important areas that the world is focusing on. \u201cWe believe the work with IBM and Walmart can serve as a global model for others to follow and replicate,\u201d he said.", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 21}

The announcement states that the payments were fully processed and cleared in a few minutes, highlighting the potential of blockchain technology to eliminate delays, unexpected fees and processing errors, paving the way for real-time cash management.\n\u201cBlockchain technology applied to cross-border payments offers an innovative way of processing in near-real-time high value transactions between different companies,\u201d said Panini Group Treasurer, Fabrizio Masinelli. \u201cThis proof of concept shows how powerful such technology can be and how it can be utilized as an effective and efficient response to the main issues that treasurers face on a daily basis. This great achievement was possible thanks to the collaboration between Panini\u2019s Group Treasury teams and the various teams of BNP Paribas.\u201d\nThe pilot project is part of the Bank\u2019s Cash Without Borders program for international payments, which leverages distributed ledger technology to avoid delays, unexpected costs and processing errors, and provide settlement and reporting in real time. BNP Paribas hasn\u2019t provided detailed information on its specific blockchain technology solution, but the takeaway message is clear: one of the world\u2019s largest banks is beginning to offer its main clients next generation payments with the speed and low cost offered by blockchain fintech.\n\u201cThis proof of concept demonstrates that blockchain technology offers real opportunities to considerably improve our offer for corporate treasury managers,\u201d said Jacques Levet, Head of Transaction Banking EMEA at BNP Paribas CIB, \u201cOn the payments front, this confirms our strong commitment to follow closely and further accelerate our participation in a number of market initiatives aiming at improving the corporate payments experience using blockchain technology.\u201d\nA Growing Interest in Blockchain Tech\nBNP Paribas, a French bank headquartered in Paris, was formed through the merger of Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and Paribas in 2000. Based on 2012 information, BNP Paribas was ranked by Bloomberg and Forbes the third-largest bank in the world, as measured by total assets. Fully integrated in the BNP Paribas Group, BNP Paribas Corporate and Institutional Banking (CIB) provides solutions to corporate and institutional clients.\nThe bank has been quietly exploring distributed ledger technology for some time. In July 2015, Bitcoin Magazine reported that BNP Paribas financial securities research analyst Johann Palychata, writing for the bank\u2019s financial magazine, Quintessence, praised Bitcoin as an innovative and disruptive open source technology for the financial world. \u201cIts core is the first successful attempt for a secure and decentralized register,\u201d said Palychata. \u201cIt should be considered as an invention like the steam or combustion engine.\u201d\nFollowing other high profile financial institutions, BNP Paribas joined two leading blockchain fintech development groups. In November 2015, the Bank joined R3, a global financial services company focused on applications of cryptographic technology and distributed ledger-based protocols within global financial markets. In July this year, BNP Paribas joined the Hyperledger Project, a collaborative cross-industry effort to advance blockchain technology led by The Linux Foundation. The bank is also on the Board of Digital Asset Holdings, a key player in the Hyperledger group. The Hyperledger news release didn't include a statement from BNP Paribas, which indicates that the Bank was not ready to unveil its blockchain-related plans at the time.\nIn September, BNP Paribas announced that it was reinforcing its commitment to distributed ledger fintech, launching a new in-house Innovation Lab, and hosting its first Blockchain Bizhackathon in New York, following previous Bizhackathon events in Europe.\n\u201cBNP Paribas\u2019 focus on new technology has been a priority for decades so we are glad to be hosting the first American Bizhackathon in New York,\u201d noted Bruno d\u2019Illiers, the Bank\u2019s Deputy Head of CIB for the Americas. \u201cWith the creation of our new in-house Innovation Lab we want to initiate a dialogue with our clients around blockchain and find new solutions to integrate the technology that will allow BNP Paribas to better serve them.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 22}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin is surging. The exchange rate of the leading digital currency broke the $800 mark earlier this week, to reach a two-year high of about $875 today. The all-time high of over $1,100 or even over $1,200 depending on the exchange, may well be tested soon.\nArguably, an even more important milestone has already been reached. Due to the increased number of bitcoins in circulation, Bitcoin breached its all-time market cap high measured in USD \u2014 in several ways.\nThe Straight-Up All-Time High Market Cap\nProbably the bluntest way to measure Bitcoin\u2019s all-time high market cap is to take the total number of coins that have been mined at any given time, and multiply that number by the highest exchange rate bitcoin was trading for at that time on a popular exchange.\nBy that measure, Bitcoin reached this benchmark on November 25, 2013. Not long before that date, the total amount of coins mined had surpassed the 12 million mark, and had on that day reached about 12,035,000 coins. Meanwhile, the bitcoin price on Bitcoin\u2019s then-biggest exchange \u2014 MtGox \u2014 topped at $1,242. As such, Bitcoin\u2019s all-time high market cap was just short of $15 billion, reaching a total of some $14,947,470,000.\nToday, a total of some 16,055,000 bitcoins have been mined throughout the duration of Bitcoin\u2019s existence. And on\u00a0Bitstamp,\u00a0itBit and\u00a0GDAX \u2014 some of Bitcoin\u2019s most used exchanges today \u2014 bitcoin\u2019s exchange rate topped out at $875. This makes for a market cap of about $14,048,125,000.\nWhile this calculation means Bitcoin\u2019s current market cap is at a three-year high, it still has about 6 percent to go to break the all-time high. Strictly speaking, therefore, there is no record yet.\nThe Non-MtGox All-Time High Market Caps\nHowever, going by the MtGox exchange rate of November 2013 is probably not the most accurate or fair way to measure bitcoin\u2019s all-time high. Although the specifics are beyond the scope of this article, there is\u00a0reason to believe MtGox had been cooking the books (at least partially cooking) to artificially boost the exchange rate that month.\nPerhaps, therefore, MtGox\u2019 all-time high of $1,242 should simply be ignored, in favor of bitcoin\u2019s exchange rate on a different exchange. This is perfectly doable: While MtGox had dominated the market for years, by November 25, 2013, it was no longer the only exchange in town. Bitstamp,\u00a0BTC-e and\u00a0Bitfinex were all claiming significant trading volume.\nOf these three, Bitfinex reached the highest exchange rate at $1,175 on November 25, 2013. With about 12,035,000 coins in circulation, this makes for a non-MtGox all-time high market cap of $14,141,125,000.\nFast-forwarding to this week, as noted, Bitstamp, itBit and GDAX, saw bitcoin\u2019s exchange rate top at $875, for a market cap of about $14,048,125,000. Less than a percentage point shy of the all-time high market cap \u2014 but, again, not a record just yet.\nUpdate Friday, December 23th (GMT): With some 16,060,000 bitcoins mined, and a high of $914 on Bitfinex, the non-MtGox all-time high market cap reached $14,678,840,000. A record.\nThe Weighted-Average, All-Time High Market Cap\nOf course, measuring market caps by any single exchange is not ideal either. Prices always deviate from one exchange to the other, and especially so in an immature market like Bitcoin, as well as during times of increased volatility experiencing price peaks or \u201cbubbles\u201d.\nA better way to determine an overall exchange rate is to take the average across exchanges, weighed by trading volume. There are several services to weigh these averages, such as Bitcoin Average.\nOn November 25, 2013, the Bitcoin Average high topped out at $1,163. Multiplied by the roughly 12,035,000 coins in circulation at that time, this adds up to a market cap of $13,996,705,000.\nToday, the exchange rate on Bitcoin Average reached $874. With some 16,055,000 bitcoins in circulation, that makes for a market cap of $14,032,070,000.\nIndeed, a record breaking, all-time high market cap!\nThe Non-Artificial-MtGox, All-Time High Market Cap\nAnd perhaps there\u2019s an even better way to measure Bitcoin\u2019s all-time high. As noted, MtGox\u2019 all-time high of $1,242 seems to have been at least partially artificial. It makes sense, therefore, to ignore the MtGox price.\nAnd this could be taken one step further. Since the MtGox price was probably at least partially artificial, other exchanges were most likely dragged along to artificially high prices as well. Traders performing arbitrage between different exchanges would buy bitcoins on Bitstamp, BTC-e or Bitfinex, to sell these on MtGox, artificially driving up prices across the board.\nAs such, perhaps the peak of November 2013 should be ignored completely. Instead, the MtGox $266 all-time high on April 10, 2013 should be considered the last \u201cnatural\u201d all-time high before the price was artificially increased. With about 11,010,000 coins in circulation, April 2013 made for a record-breaking market cap of $2,928,660,000.\nFrom that starting point, and ignoring the November 2013 peak (and the aftermath until the collapse of MtGox,) Bitcoin\u2019s all-time high market cap has been breached several times. The first time was on May 26, 2014, when bitcoin traded on Bitstamp at around $683, with a total coin supply of about 12,820,000, for a market cap of $8,756,060,000. The second time was earlier this year, on June 13, as bitcoin was trading on Bitfinex for $789. With about 15,655,000 coins in circulation, that made for a market cap of $12,351,795,000.\nAnd, indeed, today, as bitcoin traded at $875 on Bitstamp, itBit and GDAX, the market cap broke out to about $14,048,125,000.\nAnother record.\nThe Adjusted-for-Lost-Coins, All-Time High Market Cap\nLastly, some \u2014 like\u00a0Gyft founder and Civic Founder Vinny Lingham \u2014 have suggested that Bitcoin\u2019s market cap should be adjusted for lost coins. Lost coins, or bitcoins for which the private keys have been deleted or otherwise lost for good, will never be spendable at all. This means that any \u201cvalue\u201d these coins hold is lost as well and, therefore, represent no meaningful economic weight.\nUnfortunately, it is impossible to determine how many bitcoins have been lost over the years. By simply looking at the blockchain, there is no way to discern between cold storage coins that simply haven\u2019t moved for a while and coins that are actually lost.\nPerhaps rough estimates can be made, however. Most coins were probably lost in the early days, back when they weren\u2019t worth much \u2014 if anything at all. Then-worthless Bitcoin wallets could have easily been forgotten about and deleted, or otherwise lost over the years.\nBased on when the coins were first mined, and how long they haven\u2019t moved, estimates suggest that between 1.5 and 4 million coins have been lost over the years. And this number has probably remained relatively stable: Most people likely started to become more careful about backing up their private keys when bitcoin\u2019s value moved beyond $100 a coin.\nSo let\u2019s say the total number of lost coins is 2.5 million.\nThis would mean that on November 25, 2013, there were about 9,535,000 \u201cactive\u201d coins in circulation.

This new partnership is designed to allow freelancers or employees in India to receive a better rate on the payments they receive from outside the country.\nFreelancers in India have already been taking advantage of the better rates they get by telling their employers to pay them via Bitcoin rather than PayPal, and Bitwage has the potential to make the process of getting paid via Bitcoin much simpler for remote workers in the country.\nArbitrage Opportunities for Bitcoin in India\nBitcoin exchange rates in India have been much higher than the rates found in the United States or China due to the lack of liquidity in the country. The digital asset traded at a 20 percent premium compared to rates in other countries last month.\n\u201cThe reason that the price in India is so high is because companies like ours are not able to settle against foreign exchanges due to capital controls \u2014 meaning that we are unable to send large wire transfers every day or two,\u201d Unocoin President and Co-Founder Sunny Ray told Bitcoin Magazine in November.\nInternational Payments Bring Bitcoin Liquidity to India\nOf course, bitcoin prices in India have now normalized a bit. \u201cIf there is an opportunity to make money, Indians will figure out a way to capitalize,\u201d said Ray. \u201cThe arbitrage eventually disappeared because people from abroad would buy bitcoin and then send them to home to people in India until the markets normalize again (among many other factors).\u201d\nIn Ray\u2019s view, remittances and other forms of international payments have been the perfect way to bring more liquidity to India because it allows people in the country to earn a premium in the process. These new remittance applications are powered by Unocoin\u2019s API.\nThe Bitwage and Unocoin Partnership\nWhile it has already been possible for Indian freelancers to get paid in bitcoin, Bitwage streamlines the process for both sides of a transaction. An employer can pay with their bank account on one end and the employee receives bitcoin in a Unocoin account on the other end. The bitcoin can be immediately converted into Indian rupees, which means the workers do not need to worry about holding the digital asset.\nThis is an example of two companies providing a valuable, Bitcoin-based product that can be attractive to those who aren\u2019t already interested in the peer-to-peer digital cash system for ideological reasons. In the past, some investors, such as Blockchain Capital Managing Partner Brock Pierce, have noted that the most successful Bitcoin-related companies may be the ones that abstract away the technical intricacies of the digital currency.\nAccording to a press release about the partnership between Bitwage and Unocoin, an employee in India receiving $1,000 from the United States receives 8 percent more when paid via Bitwage rather than PayPal, though these rates aren\u2019t set in stone. Workers in India who are paid via Bitwage essentially receive a 4 percent increase in their pay.\nIn addition to their new venture with Bitwage, Unocoin also has a partnership with Canadian-based remittance app, Paycase.", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 21}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nTo track the progress and value of a digital currency, most people go to a website like CoinMarketCap or CoinCap.io to see the different tokens ranked by their current market capitalization. A digital currency\u2019s market cap is the total supply of coins multiplied by the token\u2019s current market price. While nothing else really comes close to bitcoin, there is an interest is seeing which other digital currencies can be found in the top ten.\nWhile market cap is an interesting data point to some, it doesn\u2019t really tell the whole story. There are a variety of other metrics that must also be taken into account when comparing various digital currencies, and market caps can sometimes be deceiving.\nA Misleading Market Cap\nDigital currency market caps can be misleading in situations where units included in the market cap calculation are not easily available for trade (if at all). This issue most commonly occurs with coins that are premined, although that\u2019s not always the case.\nThe best example of an inflated digital currency market cap due to a premine may be Auroracoin. This altcoin was reported to have a market cap of over $1 billion, but the reality was that the vast majority of the coins were not available to anyone. When counting only the coins that were available in the wild, the market cap was closer to $10 million.\nAuroracoin\u2019s current market cap is just over $1 million.\nRipple\u2019s XRP token is another asset that has been accused of overvaluation due to the company owning the vast majority of all the XRP in existence. Many also see Ripple as a permissioned ledger rather than a digital cash system, so it\u2019s unclear if it should be compared to the likes of bitcoin or even some of the altcoins.\nThe latest example of an inflated market cap has come via Steem. Large amounts of Steem are locked up and unavailable for trade due to the fact that much of the new Steem is issued as Steem Power, which cannot be withdrawn and sold immediately. The market cap for Steem peaked at around $400 million in July, and now sits at roughly $40 million.\nIn a blog post earlier this year, Civic CEO Vinny Lingham pointed out that lost coins should also play a role when calculating a digital currency\u2019\u2019s market cap. Indeed, this logic can also be applied to bitcoin, where more than one million coins could be inaccessible.\nThe Importance of Liquidity\nWhile there are definitely issues with the ways in which digital currency market caps are calculated, the good news is that other data points are also worth mentioning. \u201cThere are two big factors,\u201d said longtime bitcoin investor Trace Mayer on a recent episode of The Bitcoin Report. \u201cOne is market cap; one is liquidity. How much daily volume is getting turned over? If you need to sell $50 million worth of ethers, can the market handle that in a single day?\u201d\nMayer went on to point out that dumping a large amount of bitcoin may move the price by a couple of dollars, but that wouldn\u2019t be the case for any other digital currency. \u201cJust because you have a high market cap doesn\u2019t mean you have high liquidity,\u201d he said.\nMayer also discussed forms of liquidity found outside of the traditional digital currency exchanges. Unlike all of the altcoins, bitcoin has actual users who use the token for more than just speculation. There are merchant processors, people who earn an income in bitcoin, trading that happens off exchanges, and other forms of liquidity for bitcoin that is unrelated to pure speculation.\n\u201cBitcoin has a medium cap market cap \u2014 medium cap type stock \u2014 but it\u2019s got the liquidity of a large cap,\u201d said Mayer.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re with an experimental little project like Ethereum, Dash, or Steem \u2014 I think Steem is kind of an interesting little experiment, but there\u2019s no volume there,\u201d continued Mayer. \u201cYou want to sell $5 million worth of Steem? You\u2019re going to tank the price to zero. But you\u2019re not going to see that in bitcoin.\u201d\nA Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund\nIn Mayer\u2019s view, the various bitcoin ETFs currently undergoing review at the SEC could bring an even greater amount of liquidity to bitcoin. \u201cI don\u2019t see any other projects out there that are garnering the liquidity \u2014 let alone the security and other aspects \u2014 that we have with bitcoin,\u201d he stated.\n\u201cA big issue is determining what the price of bitcoin is,\u201d said Mayer when asked why the Winklevoss Twins\u2019 ETF proposal has yet to be approved.\nMayer sees the recently released bitcoin price index from CME Group as a sign that a proper ETF could be right around the corner because it establishes a bitcoin spot price from a trusted, traditional financial institution.", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 22}

If you like a Plantoid, you can show it appreciation by sending bitcoin to its wallet. Once a Plantoid has earned sufficient funds, it chooses an artist and commissions the artist to produce a new version of itself.\nOf course, Plantoids are different from forms of life \u2014 e.g., plants, birds, dogs and people \u2014 we are familiar with. Yet, it can be argued that Plantoids meet a more general, extended definition of life, which is flexible enough to include cybernetic ALife forms and not just organic creatures. In fact, Plantoids acquire \u201cenergy\u201d from the environment in the form of bitcoin donations, and use energy to move to new locations \u2014 for example, an art gallery that wants to exhibit a Plantoid \u2014 where they can acquire more energy, reproduce and evolve. The life, reproduction and evolution of Plantoids is ultimately mediated by people, but similar patterns are found in biological life and evolution. In fact, the relation between people and Plantoids is similar to the relation between bees and flowers.\nThe non-visible part of a Plantoid is a DAO \u2014 a Distributed Autonomous Organization with a set of smart contracts to manage the Plantoid\u2019s life cycle and reproduction. The active members of the DAO (those who have donated funds or work to a Plantoid) participate, within rules set in the smart contracts, in decisions regarding where the Plantoid may be exhibited, exactly how it is to be reproduced, which artist will be selected to create the next generation, and how to allocate the collected funds.\nSmart contracts on the blockchain that manage a Plantoid include specifications for governance rules and business logic. An interesting part of Plantoid business logic \u2014 a sort of \u201cpyramid scheme\u201d where part of a Plantoid\u2019s income is sent back to its ancestry \u2014 encourages evolutionarily successful designs. Smart contracts for a Plantoid also specify the required aesthetic parameters (such as form, size or materials) that must be respected by the artist chosen to create the Plantoid\u2019s offspring.\nDAO members can submit proposals on how to implement the next Plantoid, or comment and bid on other members\u2019 proposals. It is expected that different artists will implement different kinds of Plantoids, able to attract different types of donors or contributors to reproduce.\n\u201cPlantoid is an attempt at using art to illustrate what I consider to be one of the most innovative and disruptive aspects of the blockchain \u2014 the ability to create autonomous entities which are completely independent and self-sufficient,\u201d says Primavera De Filippi, the Founder of Okhaos, the art collective behind Plantoid, as reported by Singularity Hub. \u201cAs a \u2018blockchain-based life form,\u2019 the Plantoid brings the concept of autonomy to a whole new level.\u201d\nPlantoids have no legal status at this moment, since the law does not recognize the legal personhood of DAOs, unlike corporations. However, it seems plausible that legal systems will recognize DAOs at some point, in which case Plantoids could legally own themselves. It\u2019s also interesting to speculate on the possible evolution of Plantoids. The Plantoid ecosystem is designed for spontaneous Darwinian-like evolution to take over after the inception of the first Plantoids, and it seems likely that evolutionarily successful Plantoids will incorporate new emerging technologies.\nFor example, robotics and Internet of Things (IoT) technology could power future generations of more dynamic and interactive Plantoids. Another possibility, which sounds like science fiction but could one day become science fact, is that of intelligent Plantoids.\n\u201cWe should think of smart contracts as applications that can themselves be decentralized, autonomous, and pseudonymously running on the blockchain,\u201d notes futurist Melanie Swan in Blockchain: Blueprint for a New Economy, a 2015 book with a special focus on advanced future applications of distributed ledger technology. \u201cThus, the blockchain could be one potential path to artificial intelligence (AI) in the sense that smart-contract platforms are being designed to run at graduated stages of increasing automation, autonomy, and complexity.\u201d Swan mentions Daniel Suarez\u2019s science-fiction books Daemon and Freedom, in which \u201cthe world economy ends up radically transformed by the smart-contract type agents inexorably following their programmed code.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 26}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nCentralization of mining pools is often considered one of the biggest problems Bitcoin faces. Only a handful of pools typically control well over half of all hash power on the network, and there is little indication this trend will reverse anytime soon.\nWhile several dynamics contribute to pool centralization, one important factor is \u201corphan rates\u201d \u2014 i.e., the number of mined blocks rejected in favor of conflicting blocks. Solutions to limiting orphan rates have been proposed, usually focused on decreasing block relay time. But, unfortunately, most of these solutions do not hold up very well if mining pools are willing to disadvantage competitors.\nA different area of research trying to solve this problem is Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), also known as \u201cbraided\u201d blockchains. This solutions could tackle the selfish mining problem too... if \u00a0worked out properly.\nHere\u2019s an introduction.\n\u201cOrphans\u201d\nWhenever two blocks are mined at (or around) the same time, they both \u201crace\u201d over Bitcoin\u2019s network to reach as many nodes as possible. The first of these blocks to have a new block mined on top of it becomes part of the longest chain and is therefore considered valid by the entire network.\nThe rejected block \u2014 while otherwise valid \u2014 does not become part of the longest chain, and is therefore disregarded by the network. The block is \u201corphaned.\u201d\nThis means that all hash power spent to find that block was wasted. Valuable resources \u2014 like electricity \u2014 are lost, with no block reward to show for it. That\u2019s bad news for the miner of the orphaned block.\nMoreover, these mechanics open the door to types of\u00a0selfish mining attacks, first\u00a0described by Cornell University researchers\u2019 Ittay Eyal and Emin G\u00fcn Sirer. In short: large mining pools can strategically withhold blocks they mine to give themselves a head start against smaller competitors. This attack can be profitable even if a pool (or a combination of pools) controls as little as some 25 percent of all hash power on the network.\nThe best way for miners to mitigate these risks is to join a large pool and share profits. But, of course, this centralizes mining into fewer and larger pools, which is bad news for the decentralization of the Bitcoin network.\nBraiding\nMost solutions that deal with this problem \u2014 as described, for example, in this\u00a0two-part article \u2014 attempt to minimize relay time, so blocks can find their way across the entire network faster. This shorter relay time decreases the odds of two conflicting blocks circulating over the network. It also cuts down the total number of orphans, and in many cases works quite well.\nBut these solutions only work well if miners are \u201chonest,\u201d and don\u2019t attempt some kind of selfish mining attack. If large miners do attempt a selfish mining attack, it doesn\u2019t matter much how fast blocks can propagate over the network. The blocks are withheld anyways.\nBraiding offers a different solution.\nInstead of speeding up propagation, braiding decreases the negative effect of slow propagation \u2014 and therefore also the negative effects of selfish mining.\nIn a braided blockchain, conflicting blocks are not orphaned at all. Rather, a subsequent block is built on top of both of the conflicting blocks. Both blocks become part of the shared history, and both blocks earn their respective miners a block reward.\nThe main challenge that arises when braiding a chain, is that there still needs to be a conflict-resolution mechanism for double-spend transactions. On a regular blockchain the solution is simple: miners decide which transactions they include in blocks, and the network agrees that the longest chain of blocks is valid. Braided chains require more novel solutions, such as voting schemes; this is where the different proposals vary most.\nAs an added benefit \u2014 assuming the double-spend problem is solved \u2014 braiding opens the door to significantly reduced block intervals. A perk of Bitcoin\u2019s 10-minute block interval is that it\u2019s relatively rare for two blocks to be mined at the same time by coincidence. However, as the block interval time decreases, the odds of conflicting blocks increase, which is undesirable.\nSince with a braided chain conflicting blocks are no longer a significant issue, most proposals specify block intervals of much less than a minute.\nConcrete Proposals\nBraiding is not a new concept.\nDAGs were first\u00a0proposed by researchers Yonatan Sompolinsky and Aviv Zohar in 2013, as the GHOST (Greedy Heaviest Observed Sub-Tree) protocol, a\u00a0version of which is implemented in Ethereum. About a year ago, Dr. Bob McElrath presented a different implementation of the idea \u2014 now called braiding \u2014 at the\u00a0Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Hong Kong. More recently,\u00a0Sia developer David Vorick presented his braiding solution, called Jute, at\u00a0Scaling Bitcoin Milan. As well, Sompolinsky and Aviv Zohar, along with Yoad Lewenberg, proposed their latest braiding-like protocol,\u00a0Spectre in December of 2016.\nThat said, the concept is, generally speaking, still in the research and exploration phase. By braiding a blockchain, new problems are introduced \u2014 including the aforementioned increased risk of double-spends, but also a potential higher inflation rate and changed fee economics.\nAnd the bad news is that, because braiding is still in this phase of research and testing, these solutions probably won\u2019t soon be rolled out on Bitcoin\u2019s main chain. Furthermore, even if all problems were to be resolved, braiding probably wouldn\u2019t be easily adopted by Bitcoin. All braiding proposals so far constitute a significant overhaul of Bitcoin\u2019s mining protocol, and can probably only be rolled out as a hard fork \u2014 a switch to an entirely new network that users come to consider \u201cBitcoin.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 27}

These can be extended to\u00a0the\u00a0Lightning\u00a0Network, allowing users to transact securely with minimal footprint on the blockchain. Performance of these solutions would be significantly improved by\u00a0Segregated\u00a0Witness, the protocol upgrade proposed by the\u00a0Bitcoin Core development team. However, the Segregated Witness soft fork has not activated yet.\nLast week, four researchers from\u00a0Imperial College London and\u00a0Cornell University \u2014 Joshua Lind, Ittay Eyal, Peter Pietzuch and Emin G\u00fcn Sirer \u2014 proposed a different payment channel solution. Loosely resembling the OtherCoin concept, the researchers published a\u00a0white paper detailing their implementation, dubbed \u201cTeechan,\u201d and successfully tested an early version of the software.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Eyal said he believes Teechan is superior to the proposed alternatives.\n\u201cTeechan is more efficient than other payment channels. It\u2019s faster to complete a payment, and allows for more payments per second,\u201d the Cornell University researcher said. \u201cPlus, it doesn\u2019t require any changes to the current Bitcoin protocol.\u201d\nThe Good Ol\u2019 Payment Channel\nIn essence, Bitcoin payment channels are just multisignature (\u201cmultisig\u201d) addresses, but leveraged in clever ways.\nLet\u2019s say Alice and Bob want to open a payment channel between them. To do so, they create a 2-of-2 multisig address, for which each will generate and control one private key. Funds from this multisig address can be spent only if both Alice and Bob sign a transaction with their private keys.\nNext, both Alice and Bob send funds to this address; perhaps one bitcoin each. This funding transaction is broadcast and recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, so the bitcoins are \u201clocked in.\u201d\nAs such, the \u201cchannel state\u201d is 1-1: they both have a balance of one bitcoin each.\nNow, Alice wants to buy a pair of shoes from Bob worth 0.1 bitcoins. Instead of sending 0.1 bitcoins to Bob on the blockchain, Alice and Bob just agree that Bob should now get 1.1 bitcoins from the multisig address, and Alice 0.9 bitcoins.\nAs such, the channel state is 0.9-1.1. Alice has effectively paid Bob 0.1 bitcoins.\nIf Alice or Bob (or both) want to close the channel, they sign and broadcast a transaction from their multisig address, which pays each their share as determined by the latest channel state. In this case 0.9-1.1.\n\u201cThe beauty of payment channels is that, in the meantime, Alice and Bob could have transacted thousands of times,\u201d Eyal said. \u201cAs long as they don\u2019t broadcast transactions to the Bitcoin network, they can keep updating the channel, effectively paying each other \u2018off-chain\u2019 as much as they want.\u201d\nOf course, there are some challenges in making all this work securely. Most important, payment channels require some kind of solution to ensure that counterparties sign off on a transaction representing the latest channel state. And payment channels require some kind of solution to ensure that counterparties sign off only on the latest channel state. (If Alice, for example, could broadcast an older channel state, it would allow her to claim the full 1 bitcoin even after she bought the shoes.)\nTypical bidirectional payment channels solve this problem in novel ways that require time locks and other trickery. This works, but in some cases it requires a malleability fix (Segregated Witness) \u2014 which is still awaiting activation.\nLind, Eyal, Pietzuch and Sirer propose a different solution.\nWhat\u2019s in the Box?\nTeechan, which stands for Trusted Execution Environment Channel, is a new payment channel protocol. Like Bitcoin itself, the solution is based on open-source software: transparent and verifiable by anyone.\nBut to ensure that Alice or Bob can broadcast the latest channel state and only the latest channel state, Teechan leverages \u201ctrusted execution environments\u201d (TEEs). TEEs are secure hardware components included in Intel CPUs with Software Guard Extensions (SGX); many new computers have them. (See full list\u00a0here.)\n\u201cWith SGX TEEs, no one can \u2018look inside\u2019 to see what\u2019s going on. Unencrypted data never leaves the chip, and so not even the owner of a computer with an SGX can observe what these chips are doing; they only see the end result,\u201d Eyal explained.\nWith Teechan, both Alice and Bob first have their own TEE generate a public and private key pair. Because these keys are generated inside of the TEE, neither Alice nor Bob knows what \u201ctheir\u201d private keys are.\nThen, Alice and Bob have their TEEs connect and swap public keys. As such, their TEEs can actually communicate in encrypted form, ensuring that Alice and Bob cannot decipher what their TEEs are communicating.\nAdditionally, Alice and Bob have both their TEEs generate a Bitcoin private key. Again, neither Alice nor Bob know what \u201ctheir\u201d own Bitcoin private key is; it\u2019s inside the TEE.\nAlice and Bob\u2019s TEEs swap their private keys, in encrypted form over their secure channel. So, both TEEs now have both private keys \u2014 while Alice and Bob themselves know neither.\nThen, with these private keys, their TEEs establish a pretty regular payment channel. They generate a multisig address, which both Alice and Bob then fund with, say, 1 bitcoin. This funding transaction is broadcast and recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain and is \u201clocked in.\u201d\nWhenever Alice and Bob pay each other, they update the state of their payment channel, all from within their TEEs. In practice, this just means their TEEs keep track of the channel state. And both TEEs will update the channel state only if both Alice and Bob agree.\nFinally, if Alice wants to close the channel, her TEE uses both Bitcoin private keys to sign a transaction reflecting the latest channel state. This transaction is broadcast to the Bitcoin network, and both Alice and Bob get their funds as determined by the latest channel state. (If Bob wants to close the channel, of course, Bob\u2019s TEE signs this closing transaction.)\nThe TEEs solve both main payment channel challenges. Since both Alice\u2019s and Bob\u2019s TEEs control both Bitcoin private keys, they can always be sure to get their funds out. And the reason Alice and Bob cannot broadcast older channel states is simple: the Teechan software won\u2019t allow it.\nAll the Trust That's Required to Make It Work ...\nAll this really only leaves one problem: Alice could lie to Bob about using a TEE in the first place \u2014 or Bob could lie to Alice.\nEven though they would claim they created their Bitcoin private keys inside of the TEEs, and even though they\u2019d exchange encrypted messages, they could be doing all of this from a regular CPU. Alice could hold on to all of her keys, allowing her to also decrypt Bob\u2019s Bitcoin private key. With it, she could take all the funds from the channel.\nThis is where a little bit of trust comes in.\nBy a process called \u201cremote attestation,\u201d Intel \u2014 the creator of the SGX CPU that both Alice and Bob use \u2014 has a way to verify whether Alice and Bob are telling the truth. Using a special private key that only Intel should have, the technology company can use the first package Alice and Bob send across (the encrypted funding transaction), and check that it was produced both with the Teechan software and from their TEEs. However, Intel does not get to see the the content of the package; it remains encrypted.\nIf Alice and Bob trust Intel not to lie to them, they can be sure their counterparty really created the funding transaction from their TEEs. Alice and Bob can be sure neither of them know the Bitcoin private keys for their shared multisig address.\nThis works well if you trust Intel. Though of course, for this very reason, some Bitcoin purists won\u2019t like the solution. For one, they don\u2019t want to have to trust anyone, not even Intel. And second, the solution is not entirely permissionless: it requires a remote attestation license from Intel, which so far has been difficult to obtain.\nEyal, however, believes these concerns are overstated.\n\u201cAnyone running their Bitcoin software on an Intel machine is already placing their trust in Intel, so trusting the SGX mechanism seems natural,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if they don\u2019t, there are alternatives TEEs, if one prefers another TEE vendor due to trust or availability considerations. Additionally, the trust is limited to the involved parties: the participants in the payment channel, and the TEE vendor. Anyone outside the channel \u2014 all other Bitcoin users \u2014 remain oblivious to the channel construction and trust relations involved.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 28}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin, digital currency and blockchain technology experienced another explosive year in 2016. While bitcoin breached the all-time high in USD market cap, several new digital currencies claimed a place in the spotlights as well, while the blockchain buzz arguably peaked it all.\nOf course, Bitcoin Magazine kept up with all of it. Looking back on 2016, we compiled three top 6 lists, with our best-read topics in technology, business and news.\nThese were 2016\u2019s six top stories in technology, by popularity.\n6: BIP 151\u2019s End-to-End Encryption\nCommunication between Bitcoin nodes \u2014 and between nodes and SPV clients \u2014 is currently not encrypted by default. Unless precautions are taken, data transmitted over the Bitcoin network can be tracked by internet service providers, open-WiFi providers and anyone monitoring the Bitcoin network.\nBut that may soon change.\u00a0Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 151, drafted by\u00a0Bitcoin Core developer Jonas Schnelli, is designed to make encryption between Bitcoin nodes the standard. If widely adopted (and alternative Bitcoin implementation bcoin already did adopt the solution), this should make it harder to censor specific transactions or blocks, while potentially offering increased privacy to Bitcoin users.\nAlthough\u00a0not everyone believes BIP 151 is preferable over conventional methods such as Tor or VPNs, the proposal garnered a lot of interest among Bitcoin Magazine readers, securing a sixth place on our list for 2016.\n5: The Lightning Network\nThroughout most of 2016, the central topic of debate within the Bitcoin community was, undoubtedly, scaling. The question of how best to increase transaction throughput on the Bitcoin network was on nearly everyone\u2019s mind, while preferred solutions vary.\nAs one of the most promising proposals,\u00a0the\u00a0lightning\u00a0network could just be a game changer. The innovative solution \u2014 which is especially suited for micropayments \u2014 should minimize the amount of \u201con-chain\u201d transactions required, while also realizing instant confirmations and increased privacy.\nThe lightning network and similar, compatible projects like Amiko Pay and Thunder were first proposed in 2015, and are by now developed by at least six companies. In a best-case scenario, production-ready software could be launched this winter \u2014 though much depends on activation of the Segregated Witness soft fork as proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team.\nWhether the lightning network will be as successful as many hope remains to be seen, but it was definitely one of the most popular topics on Bitcoin Magazine, placing fifth on this year\u2019s list.\n4: Multisig\nNumber four on our list is an oldie but a goodie: multisignature, or multisig, transactions.\nMultisig transactions are transactions that require multiple signatures to be valid. Using multisig, several people can for example share a single wallet and be sure no single person runs off with the funds. More recently, multisig has become the basis for more complex solutions, such as the lightning network.\nTechnically, multisig has been part of the Bitcoin protocol ever since Satoshi Nakamoto launched the code in 2009, though it was nonstandard during the first years. It became a standard part of the Bitcoin protocol in 2012. Over the four years since, multisig has become fairly common, with several wallets offering the option by default.\nMultisig is probably still the most basic, but also the most used, smart contract application to date, which could explain why Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s article on the topic is still among the most popular pieces on the website.\n3: Ethereum and Turing Completeness\nIn many ways, 2016 was the year of\u00a0Ethereum. The smart contract platform itself (Ethereum) and its native token (ether/ETH) experienced a boom throughout the first half of the year: ETH increased from less than $1 to over $20. And while the exchange rate has since dropped to around $8, it\u2019s still one of the best-performing digital currencies of 2016.\nThe Ethereum smart contract platform, moreover, has been heralded by some as the future not only of digital currency but perhaps even of computing itself. While Bitcoin is somewhat limited in scope, Ethereum\u2019s Turing completeness allows for the creation of any blockchain-based software application.\nBut Ethereum has also been through a rough second half of 2016. First, the high-profile multimillion-dollar investment platform \u201cThe DAO\u201d was compromised, after which the Ethereum Foundation opted for a controversial emergency hard fork to restore lost funds \u2014 causing a split in the blockchain. Later, Ethereum was subject to a series of attacks, which had to be solved with more hard forks.\nWhile some see this series of hard forks to be a useful process to make Ethereum more robust against future attacks, others question whether Turing completeness is really a desirable feature for a digital currency, after all.\nEither way, Ethereum and its Turing completeness were the focus of much attention throughout 2016, securing a third place on our list.\n2: Segregated Witness\nFirst publicly presented a couple weeks before the close of 2015,\u00a0Segregated\u00a0Witness was developed and tested throughout most of 2016 and officially launched late October of this year.\nA centerpiece of Bitcoin Core\u2019s scalability road map, the proposed soft fork could offer several benefits. Perhaps most important, Segregated Witness would fix malleability, in effect laying the groundwork for optimized versions of the aforementioned lightning network. The proposed protocol upgrade would also extend Bitcoin\u2019s flexibility through script versioning; it includes an effective block-size limit increase and more.\nHowever, throughout the last quarter of 2016, it became clear that activation of the soft fork is not a given. At least one mining pool \u2014 China-based ViaBTC \u2014 actively opposes activation of the Segregated Witness soft fork. Whether or not the proposal will be adopted could well turn out to be one of the most important stories of 2017.\nFor 2016, SegWit has secured second place on our list.\n1: Zcash and zkSNARKs\nEthereum was not the only Bitcoin alternative to steal headlines in 2016.\nStarted off as an anonymity layer for Bitcoin back in 2013, Zcash launched as an altcoin in October.\nThe digital currency that is being developed by Zooko Wilcox-O\u2019Hearn and his team immediately generated massive hype. Partly due to its controversial but heavily publicized \u201ctrusted setup,\u201d partly due to its crazy market action shortly after launch and, of course, also partly due to its underlying technology: zkSNARKs.\nA zkSNARK \u2014 the \u201czk\u201d stands for zero-knowledge and the \u201cSNARK\u201d for Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge \u2014 is a novel cryptographic technique that guarantees the validity of transactions while revealing almost no data about these transactions at all. In Zcash, this is utilized to hide which addresses are transacting and how much money is sent. Zcash achieves a level of anonymity not seen before in any digital currency.\nBitcoin Magazine was as engaged in the Zcash launch process as the rest of the digital-currency world, securing the brand-new currency and its underlying tech the top spot in our top 6 tech trends of 2016.", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 29}

In fact, according to the authors of the paper, the \u201cplatform revolution\" represented by these two companies, as well as similar companies such as Etsy and Lending Club, works to enrich the platform owners while preying on the value creators.\nAt the same time, the authors, Paolo Tasca, a Director at the UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies, and Mihaela Ulieru, President of The Impact Institute, propose that distributed ledger technology could enable real sharing economy marketplaces without intermediaries and central hubs, where all transactions between consumers and service providers are routed through decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) networks.\nUber and Airbnb present very appealing frontends to consumers, offering services that are often faster, cheaper and better than traditional alternatives, delivered via sophisticated yet easy to use apps. To the consumer, the possibility to buy services directly from individual providers gives the impression that Uber and Airbnb are decentralized, P2P networks.\nIn fact, these are both centralized systems because the transactions between individual consumers and providers are routed through infrastructure, hubs and software that belong to the companies that own the platform. Besides taking a fee, the platform owners are in complete control of the network. In particular, they can dictate their conditions to the value creators \u2014 drivers and rental owners \u2014 and perhaps eventually alienate them, which would result in alienating also the consumers in the long run.\n\u201cTo the novice, Uber-like networks seem to be decentralized,\u201d note Tasca and Ulieru. \u201cYet, while Uber runs on a \u2018smart\u2019 phone, it does so via a quite \u2018dumb\u2019 application (app) which links into a centralized platform, which is completely controlled by and supports the goals of the company. Centralized innovation means slow innovation. It also means innovation directed by the goals of a single company. Finally, it means single point of failure.\u201d\nAnother shortcoming of the centralized sharing economy is its vulnerability to regulatory action The economists note that, as centralized sharing economy operators reach \"too big to fail\" proportions, there will continue to be regulatory and policy skirmishes on every possible front.\nEnvisioning an Authentic Sharing Economy\n\u201c[What] would a platform enabling an authentic sharing economy, with the value created being equitably returned back to reward the value creators, look like?\u201d wonder Tasca and Ulieru. \u201cAre there principles which can guide the design of such platforms?\u201d\nAmong the options presented in the paper, the possibility to route user-to-user services through blockchain-based platforms on the top of open and decentralized networks seems especially relevant. Open decentralized networks, of which the early phases of the internet itself provide good examples, enable the creation of all sort of services at the edges.\nThe blockchain \u201coffers one service: securely time-stamped scripted transactions,\u201d note the economists. \u201cEverything else is built on the edge-devices as an app. It allows any app to be developed independently, without permission, on the edge of the network. A developer can create a new app using the transactional service as a platform and deploy it on any device.\u201d\nEventually, centralized sharing economy platforms controlled by single owners could be replaced by decentralized cooperatives that issue blockchain-based shares or crypto-equity tokens to give ownership or membership rights to workers and stakeholders. In other words, Uber without Uber, controlled by the commons, where all revenue after overhead costs goes to the members of the co-op, who also control the platform and make decisions.\nTasca and Ulieru are persuaded that, in a not-so-distant future, we will organize our economic life around P2P decentralized sharing economy platforms, with the potential to dramatically narrow the income divide, democratize the global economy and create a more ecologically sustainable society. \u201cThese possibilities will be multiplied by the combination of blockchain-based platforms with other emerging technology breakthroughs,\u201d they conclude.", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 1}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nWikiLeaks\u2019\u00a0public donation address recently received its 4000th bitcoin. The nonprofit whistle blower site, which to a large extent relies on donations, reached this milestone on November 12, with well over 25,000 incoming transactions over five years time. The total amount of bitcoins WikiLeaks received is even higher, as the media organization also lets users\u00a0generate custom Bitcoin donation addresses if they prefer not to donate to the public address.\nDigital currency has proven vital for WikiLeaks\u2019 survival over the past years. Shortly after the release of classified U.S. diplomatic cables in November 2010, all donations to WikiLeaks were\u00a0blocked by major payment providers, including Bank of America, VISA, MasterCard, PayPal and Western Union. This embargo is said to have initially destroyed 95 percent of the organization\u2019s revenue \u2014 almost killing WikiLeaks in the process. By opening up to bitcoin and litecoin donations, over the years the media organization\u00a0received a majority of all funds in digital currencies.\nThe 4000 bitcoins sent to WikiLeaks\u2019 public donation address add up to almost $3 million at today\u2019s price, though the media organization received most donations throughout 2011 and 2012 \u2014 when the digital currency was worth less than $10. A rough estimate of total donation value suggests WikiLeaks received a total of over $177,000 worth of bitcoin on the public address.\nWikiLeaks held on to most of the bitcoins it received, speculating on a price increase that proved lucrative, as Assange said in a Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything):\n\u201cWikiLeaks\u2019 strategic investments in the currency saw more than 8,000 percent return in three years, seeing us through the extralegal U.S. banking blockade.\u201d\nHistory\nInterestingly, the idea to have WikiLeaks accept bitcoin donations was initially met with some resistance from the Bitcoin community. On a Bitcointalk thread that was started shortly after the banking blockade was initiated, several forum members \u2014 including Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto \u2014 argued it was too early in Bitcoin\u2019s life to be associated with an organization like WikiLeaks.\n\u201cNo, don't \u2018bring it on\u2019,\u201d Nakamoto\u00a0posted in response to another forum member arguing in favor of donating to WikiLeaks. \u201cThe project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cI make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a small beta community in its infancy. You would not stand to get more than pocket change, and the heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage.\u201d\nA\u00a0PC World article published soon after suggested the same idea, once again to the dismay of Bitcoin\u2019s inventor.\n\u201cIt would have been nice to get this attention in any other context,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWikiLeaks has kicked the hornet's nest, and the swarm is headed towards us.\u201d\nIt was Nakamoto\u2019s second-to-last message ever posted on the forum.\nAssange\nWikiLeaks Founder and Editor-in-Chief, Julian Assange, later acknowledged he had seen Nakamoto\u2019s plea, and agreed that his organization shouldn\u2019t jeopardize Bitcoin\u2019s future. In his book When Google Met WikiLeaks, Assange explained, \u201cWikiLeaks read and agreed with Satoshi\u2019s analysis, and decided to put off the launch of a Bitcoin donation channel until the currency had become more established. WikiLeaks\u2019 Bitcoin donation address was launched after the currency\u2019s first major boom, on June 14, 2011.\u201d\nDuring the above mentioned AMA, and more recently speaking\u00a0at an event, the WikiLeaks founder also argued for the importance of Bitcoin from a non-monetary perspective.\n\u201cBitcoin is an extremely important innovation, but not in the way most people think,\u201d he said. \u201cBitcoin's real innovation is a globally verifiable proof publishing at a certain time. The whole system is built on that concept and many other systems can also be built on it.

One of the three cryptographers who first broke the U.S. Government's hash standard, and advised on the latest iteration, Yin moves from research work into practical blockchain development related to the security concerns and cryptography challenges the industry faces. Yin\u2019s work, known around the world, provides the foundations of numerous global cryptography standards.\n\"Having a deep understanding of advanced cryptographic techniques is crucial to the successful development of distributed ledger technology, which requires dedicated security and privacy solutions for its implementation and deployment,\u201d Yin told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cProviding value to users of the technology means maintaining the highest standards of data security and integrity without sacrificing functionality, scalability or decentralization.\"\nYin, who received her doctorate in applied mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has over twenty years of experience in research, implementation, consulting and standardization of cutting-edge security technologies. She served as Chief Editor of IEEE P1363, the first comprehensive standard for public key cryptography, which became the foundation for major cryptography standards used today.\nYin was one of three researchers who broke SHA-1, the U.S. Government hash standard, in 2005. \u201cSHA-1 has been broken,\u201d announced legendary cryptographer Bruce Schneier. \u201cNot a reduced-round version. Not a simplified version. The real thing.\u201d Schneier added that he expected this to happen, \u201cbut not nearly this quickly and not nearly this impressively,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Chinese cryptographers deserve a lot of credit for their work, and we need to get to work replacing SHA.\u201d\n\u201cCryptography and computer security are extremely fast-moving fields, so it is imperative to be able to take full advantage of the latest developments, to anticipate and proactively address new forms of attacks,\u201d said Symbiont\u2019s Co-Founder and CTO Adam Krellenstein. \u201cLisa\u2019s deep knowledge in cryptography, and her broad connections to the research community and the industry, will allow us to leverage a wide spectrum of expertise in these fields.\u201d\nSymbiont is implementing blockchain and smart contracts in Delaware, and has publicly deployed the technology with 15 financial institutions and European financial services provider, Allianz. With information this sensitive, it is of paramount importance that the company's cryptography standards be of NSA-quality, and this is where Yin is expected to make a difference. In her new role as Symbiont\u2019s Chief Security Officer and Chief Cryptographer, Yin will lead the development of advanced security and privacy solutions for Symbiont\u2019s platform.\n\u201cThe Symbiont team has already solved hard problems that give its platform a competitive edge in terms of both security and performance,\u201d said Yin. \u201cI am very excited to join the team, and I look forward to keeping Symbiont ahead of the curve on developments in cryptography, which is a critical building block for distributed ledger technology.\u201d\nSymbiont claims that its platform already has a competitive edge in performance. \u201cSymbiont\u2019s ledger is currently processing 80,000 transactions per second in a single region, and tens of thousands per second globally,\u201d said prominent financial veteran Caitlin Long when she joined Symbiont as President and Chairman of the Board of Directors. \u201cPlus, transaction latency is on the order of milliseconds. So Symbiont\u2019s software is not just outperforming all competitors whose comparable statistics we know \u2014 it\u2019s outperforming them by multiple orders of magnitude.\u201d \u201cWe've proven that we can build a fast, secure and powerful distributed ledger capable of meeting the high demands of institutional finance,\" said Krellenstein, confirming the performance figures quoted by Long.\nOffering a competitive edge in security is therefore also a strategic priority for Symbiont, as more and more high profile institutional and corporate clients start deploying Symbiont\u2019s platform. Symbiont is working with the State of Delaware on the Delaware Blockchain Initiative to store State archival records on a distributed ledger. In the catastrophe insurance market, Allianz and Nephila Capital have both successfully piloted the use of blockchain smart contract technology based on the Symbiont platform. Credit Suisse, Ipreo, Symbiont and R3 have successfully completed the initial stage of a project demonstrating how blockchain technology can be used to improve the syndicated loan market.\nThese high profiles users can only commit to a platform offering the highest security standards, and hiring Yin seems a smart and timely move for Symbiont.", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 2}

Along with evidence that evidence-tampering may have taken place, this fact was documented in a discovery letter this week by his legal team.\nThe revelation follows last year\u2019s conviction of Drug Enforcement agent, Carl Mark Force IV, and Secret Service / NSA agent, Shaun Bridges, both of whom were Silk Road investigators. Both used pseudonyms to pilfer bitcoins from the site, and attempted to extort money from DPR. In addition, they both had high-level admin access to the site, with the ability to access accounts, manipulate data and change passwords.\nIn 2013, Ulbricht was arrested for running Silk Road as DPR, a multimillion dollar online enterprise popular with drug dealers and others engaging in anonymous transactions. He was later sentenced to life without parole plus 40 years on five non-violent counts:\u00a0Distribution of Narcotics by Means of the Internet; Continuing Criminal Enterprise; Conspiracy to Commit and Aid and Abet Computer Hacking; Conspiracy to Traffic in Fraudulent Identity Documents; and, Money Laundering Conspiracy. Early in the case there were also allegations of murder-for-hire schemes involving Ulbricht, but he was not charged with them at trial and they have never been substantiated.\nFederal authorities have cast Ulbricht as generally dangerous, a potential threat to society. Others with more of a libertarian, anarcho-capitalist bent go so far as to assert that he is being made an example of for having the audacity to champion freedom and liberty.\nThroughout Ross\u2019 journey of imprisonment, his mother Lyn Ulbricht has been his biggest champion. She has doggedly persisted in advocating for his release, traveling the world to speak at freedom festivals and events while garnering thousands of dollars in support of her son\u2019s appeal. She has been a lightning rod for public discourse on topics ranging from due process rights and sentencing laws to fair trials and internet rights.\nIn an exclusive interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Lyn shared the contents of a letter written to her by Ross from prison. With her permission, below are a few excerpts that he shared about his imprisonment and the wisdom he has garnered from the experience:\nOn the Brutal Realities of Prison Life\nThe scope of my life became very narrow once I was locked up. My contact with the outside was limited to an hour visit each week, 300 phone minutes, letters and whatever was on TV and the radio. My diet was, well\u2026let\u2019s just say it\u2019s not what I\u2019d like it to be. And my social circle became the 99 other prisoners in my unit and a handful of regular guards. This was shocking on a visceral level, like being thrown in an ice bath. The contrast with freedom was especially intense because I spent the first six weeks in different levels of isolation.\nSettling Into Life Among the General Prison Population\nOnce I\u2019d been released from solitary into the general population and somewhat settled into my new reality, the war within truly began. It started with boredom. There were very few things to distract me during the many hours of the day. I did what I could to prepare my defense. I played ping pong for hours on end. I had textbooks sent in to study. I read several books every month. I took up yoga and practiced diligently for months and months. Eventually the distractions wore thin and a kind of subtle panic set in.\nOn Handling Day-to-Day Prison Life\nThere\u2019s another route I\u2019ve seen some men take in here and I\u2019ve done my best to emulate them. The first who taught me how to do time had spent 12 years in maximum security penitentiaries. I noticed he was never in a rush. Crossing his path could turn into an hour-long conversation about anything, either serious or funny, but never dull. He taught me acceptance.\n\u201cYou have to confront the horror of your situation, come to grips with it and accept where you\u2019re at,\u201d he said to me one day as we sat chatting in his cell. \u201cGive yourself a pass for a few days, maybe a week. Don\u2019t worry about anything else and just feel the sadness, the fear, the loss, but don\u2019t wallow in it for too long either. Get back to your yoga and the rest of your routine when you\u2019re done.\nA Major Revelation\nThis hit home recently when I was locked in (with) my last cell mate. The facility I\u2019m in is widely regarded as one of the most constrained and difficult to live in. I realized, even if I spend the rest of my life behind bars as I\u2019ve been sentenced to do, I\u2019ll never be worse off than right now.\n\u201cI got this,\u201d I thought. \u201cNo matter what happens I can get through it and come out better on the other side.\u201d I looked over at my cellmate, who was looking kinda bored, and a silly impulse hit me. I kneeled next to him where he lay on his bunk and held his gaze in mock seriousness.\n\u201cWe got this,\u201d I whispered intensely.\nThe full text of Ross\u2019s letter can be found on the FreeRoss.org website.\nLyn Ulbricht: \u201cWe Only Know The Tip of the Iceberg\u201d\n\u201cRoss is a wonderful person, as the 100 letters written to the judge (and posted at FreeRoss.org) demonstrate,\u201d said Lyn Ulbricht in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cHe is no danger to anyone, but on the contrary could contribute to others and his community if set free. In addition, he did not receive a fair trial, as his appeal argues. Rather, it was a travesty of justice that must be rectified.\u201d\nWith respect to the recent revelations that could prove significant in his case, Lyn comments:\n\u201cWe have recently learned that someone using the Dread Pirate Roberts account logged into the Silk Road forum nearly seven weeks after Ross was arrested. A record of this was buried deep within the five to six terabytes the government produced in the discovery. The evidence shows that the last login by DPR was made November 18, 2013, four days before the Silk Road forum was taken offline on November 22, 2013. Ross Ulbricht was arrested on Oct. 1, 2013, and has been in custody ever since.\u201d\nLyn says that the recently uncovered evidence is mentioned in the demand for additional discovery that was sent to the AUSA in Maryland:\n\u201cThere is a record in the database for every account, showing the most recent login. We don\u2019t know when that person or persons originally gained access, or how many times they logged into Silk Road as DPR. We don\u2019t know how many DPRs there were. What we now know from the discovery evidence provided by the government is that the last time someone using the DPR account logged into the Silk Road Forum was November 18, 2013, when Ross Ulbricht had been in prison for nearly seven weeks.\u201d\nShe continues:\n\u201cJoshua Dratel, Ross' lawyer, said a long time ago that we only know the tip of the iceberg regarding the corruption in this case. This week we have seen another big chunk of ice revealed: evidence tampering and apparently at least one additional DPR. If this backup of the forum database had not been saved or discovered; if logins made by DPR after Ross' arrest were not found, no one would be the wiser. This begs the question: how much more is there? Unfortunately we may never know, as it's the nature of digital evidence that it's easily changed, planted or deleted without a trace. That my son \u2014 or anyone \u2014 would get a life sentence without parole based on vulnerable digital evidence, especially when it's been corrupted, puts us all in peril.\u201d\nThroughout her son\u2019s imprisonment, Lyn says that her main fear is that his time spent behind bars would break his spirit. But she notes that Ross has shown great strength, both mentally and emotionally. \u201cOf course he has his down times, but he pulls himself out of it. He has worked at being intentionally positive in a very tough place, and makes a point of contributing to fellow inmates in many ways, including tutoring, teaching classes and being a good example.\u201d\nLyn says she tires of hearing the myths being perpetuated in the media and otherwise regarding Ross and Silk Road. \u201cAnyone who knows Ross will tell you that it is absurd to depict him as a thuggish kingpin who would advocate violence to protect his empire. And it is important to note that murder-for-hire charges were never made at trial. Ross is not motivated by money or power, but rather is committed to his ideals of freedom and peace. This is obvious in his writings, and to anyone who knows him.\u201d\nAmid the ongoing flow of new information pouring in about Ulbricht\u2019s case, public support for his release continues to grow. This Sunday, December 4 from 2-10 p.m. EST, a Free Ross-A-Thon livestream is being hosted by FreeRoss.org to bring awareness to Ross Ulbricht\u2019s Silk Road trial, and to raise funds for the printing and binding of Ulbricht\u2019s appeal documents.\nThe livestream will feature well known bitcoiners, economists, activists, policy analysts, historians, filmmakers, musicians and thought leaders, including Jeffrey Tucker, Jeff Berwick, Roger Ver, Jesse Ventura, Brian Doherty, Carla Gericke, Tatiana Moroz, Tom Woods, Bob Murphy, Doug Casey, and the Ulbricht family among many others.\nIn terms of what\u2019s next for Ross in the new year, Lyn says, \u201cHe will probably receive the appellate court's ruling on his appeal and will then know if he will be allowed a new trial. If he is, hopefully this time it will be a fair one in which the jury is told all the evidence.\u201d\n", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 2}

The trend was strong enough to be noticed by the mainstream financial press, and The Wall Street Journal ran a story titled \u201cChinese investors buying up bitcoin as yuan falls.\u201d\nBitcoin Magazine contacted leading Bitcoin operators and exchange CEOs in China to take the pulse of the market in light of this most recent upward price trend.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very exciting to see bitcoin\u2019s current price rally,\u201d said BTCC CEO Bobby Lee. \u201cIt\u2019s about time! We\u2019ve been seeing record trading volumes in China this quarter, as the devaluation of the renminbi continues. I think bitcoin\u2019s price might surpass its 2013 all-time high, as soon as early 2017, reaching or surpassing $1,500.\u201d\u201cBesides the devaluation of the yuan, I think the main reason behind bitcoin\u2019s 80 percent price rise this year is because of major global political and economic upheavals, including Brexit, Trump\u2019s election, turmoil in the banking sector, India\u2019s cancellation of larger-denomination banking notes and Venezuela\u2019s introduction of more stringent capital controls,\u201d Lee told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cI also think bitcoin\u2019s relative stability and its improvements \u2014 such as the implementation of SegWit this year \u2014 have made it a safe choice for investors, in comparison with altcoins.\u201d\u201cLooking to the long term, I think bitcoin will reach several thousand U.S. dollars, and might even reach $10,000, before the next block-halving in 2020,\u201d concluded Lee. \u201cThis prediction makes sense if you look at how much governments have continued expanding the supply of fiat currencies through printing money and other quantitative easing solutions. Remember: as money supply continues to rapidly increase over time, bitcoin\u2019s price will go up because bitcoin price is measured in units of these inflating currencies.\u201d\n\u201cSince the Trump election, the PBOC [People\u2019s Bank of China] has allowed the CNY to weaken within a hair's breath of 7.00 [per US dollar],\u201d said Arthur Hayes, Co-Founder and CEO of BitMEX. \u201cDuring this recent period of devaluation, Beijing closed one of the most important channels of capital flight, offshore M&A [mergers and acquisitions]. Chinese companies acquiring overseas firms must now get approval from the government.\u201d\nSimilar to its behavior on other exchanges, the exchange rate of bitcoin at BitMEX is surging noticeably at the time of writing.\n\u201cFor regular comrades, it is getting harder and harder to escape the weakening CNY,\u201d Hayes told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cMany tried to escape into the commodity markets after the stock market crashed and property became unaffordable. Beijing is not keen on this rampant speculation and has increased margin requirements, thus causing a collapse in commodity futures trading volumes.\u201d\u201cBitcoin remains one market where Chinese people can speculate 24/7, and they can convert some wealth into bitcoin as a hedge against a weakening domestic currency,\u201d concluded Hayes. \u201cThat is why bitcoin is trading at 2-year highs in China.\u201d\n\"With the recent blockchain hype decreasing, many startups are turning their eyes on bitcoin,\u201d BitKan CEO Leon Liu told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cBitKan tx volumes are suggesting that the usage of bitcoin in China and many other emerging markets is growing. Previously, Chinese users are speculation-driven, but number of actual users is increasing fast. Based on the statistics, we are bullish on the bitcoin price.\"\nAccording to the data from the domestic trading platform, Huobi.com, December 2 saw a precipitous increase in Bitcoin price. At 10 a.m. in China, bitcoin prices reached their highest level since January of 2014, maxing out at a high of 5497 RMB at 1:56 p.m.\n\"From a global economic perspective, we are in an era of increasingly uncertain variables,\u201d said Huobi COO Zhu Jiawei. \u201cBitcoin\u2019s price jumped 21 percent on the day of Brexit. Risk aversion has begun, and outside investment channels are ready.\n\u201cFrom the investment environment in China, RMB depreciation continues, leading to strong demand for hedges,\u201d Jiawei told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cAnd with real estate market regulation, people are looking to futures and bitcoin to hedge against RMB depreciation. And for bitcoin itself, awareness this year has increased and investors have paid increasing attention to it as an investment product.\u201d\n\u201cThe central bank has contributed to popularizing digital currency, hiring new digital currency talent, and announcing that the digital currency initiative of the central bank has completed the two rounds of revision,\u201d concluded Jiawei. \u201cAll of this is leading to more people in China seeing the value of bitcoin.\"\n\"In the past two years, the Chinese government has had a relatively loose attitude towards bitcoin,\u201d CHBTC CEO Dawei Li told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cChina's central bank also is actively preparing to issue its digital currency, which is a positive signal for bitcoin companies and investors. The recent devaluations of the CNY has also helped to legitimize bitcoin; this coupled with current macroeconomic crises around the world, we believe, has lead to substantial inflows of capital into bitcoin as it is increasingly seen a safe haven asset in the eyes of local investors.\"\nGongShi Tan, BTC Media\u2019s Chinese affiliate, touched base\u00a0with outspoken Chinese bitcoin miner and ltc1btc CEO Zhuo\u2019er Jiang, who said that he sees the price of bitcoin being in a \u201cbull market cycle \u2026 especially if we complete a big block expansion, which will lift the limitations of the transactions and active IP addresses. According to Metcalfe's law, the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system. In that case, I think the bitcoin price is very likely to hit twice its highest point, which would be 16,000 RMB.\u201d\n\u201cThere have been a lot of discussions in the past month on new regulations and attention from the regulators on controlling cross-border capital flow, which is certainly driving a certain amount of interest in bitcoin in China,\u201d said Zennon Kapron, Founder and Director of Kapronasia, a leading financial industry research and consultancy firm specializing in Asian markets. The author of Chomping at the Bitcoin: The Past, Present and Future of Bitcoin in China, Kapron has more than 20 years experience in the finance and technology sectors, working at Citibank and Intel before setting up KapronAsia in 2007.\u201cWe are also seeing some of the major blockchain initiatives waiver, like R3, which seems to be losing investors,\u201d Kapron told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cAlthough the banks pulling out appear to be either following competition initiatives or starting their own, it could also represent the mood that it indicates a longer-term pivot by the financial industry back to bitcoin.\u201d\u201cA significant amount of money has flowed into other crypto launches, most notably Zcash, which had some tremendous volatility in the month since launch,\u201d concluded Kapron. \u201cSome of that money is likely coming back to bitcoin, especially as the price of Zcash drops along with its volatility.\u201d\nKapron\u2019s observations on the \u201cback to bitcoin\u201d trend seem especially interesting. In fact, despite the interest raised by alternative blockchains, only bitcoin has achieved real popularity as a safe asset for investors, Therefore, a weak CNY is likely to continue to make switching to bitcoin more and more appealing for Chinese investors.\n\u201cThis has clearly been a year of blockchain in China with positive government involvement and major investment,\u201d said John Riggins, Editor of GongShi Tan. \u201cMeanwhile, bitcoin prices have snuck up past 2-year highs.\u201d\n\u201cThis bitcoin price momentum has shown that bitcoin, the original blockchain use case, is still alive and well and that China can continue to be the driver in terms of adoption and price movement,\u201d added Riggins. \u201cThe team at GongShi Tan is excited to cover these developments from the ground in Shanghai, as we aim to be a reliable and insightful information source in China and bridge from China to the English-speaking world.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 2}

This proposed directive which will now be pushed back to June 2017, proposes stricter controls around corporate entity structures and virtual currencies, with greater powers granted to tax authorities to investigate crimes. A January 25, 2017 vote of the European Parliament\u2019s Economic and Monetary Affairs has been scheduled before it moves on to a wider vote by the European Parliament.\nTerrorist acts in Brussels and Paris, along with tax evasion concerns following the Panama Papers scandal, has led to calls by the European Commission for tightened oversight and regulatory due diligence for banks and financial services firms. Greater accountability and monitoring practices involving digital currencies and other forms of payment have been proposed in an attempt to mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The commission in particular has targeted bitcoin for increased attention, noting its ease of use in facilitating anonymous funds transactions for criminal purposes.\nIf enacted, this move would certainly create concerns among exchanges and wallet providers that foster transactions between fiat and virtual currencies as they would likely be required to turn over client lists to authorities. The commission is also exploring the possibility of establishing a mandatory (self declaratory) database of digital currency users to thwart digital money traders from masking their identity. These efforts at capturing user data mirror recent efforts by the U.S. Department of Treasury to identify users of the bitcoin exchange Coinbase.\nIn addition, national financial intelligence units charged with monitoring suspicious transactions and other data pertaining to money laundering will be issued more powers. This includes the ability to demand information from banking and financial services firms irrespective of whether reports of suspicious activity have been issued.\nFinally, beneficial owners of business entities will be more closely watched for tax evasion purposes and would be subject to severe noncompliance penalties and fines.\nEfforts at enacting regulatory controls are also afoot on a nation-by-nation basis. Germany and Austria are funding a project targeting financial crimes, again with an emphasis on digital currencies. Concerned about the proliferation of \u00a0digital currencies being used independent of central banks or other authorities, this collaborative effort known as BITCRIME will bring together funding from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the Austrian Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology (BMVIT).\nSwitzerland is also set to introduce legislation in 2017, which includes licensure for FinTech companies. There are also plans to establish a regulatory \u201csandbox,\u201d or an innovation ecosystem, for firms involved in experimental early stage innovation projects. Moreover, the Financial Market Supervisory Authority which will serve as the primary regulator, plans to pursue deeper efforts aimed at understanding both digital currencies and blockchain technology.\nJoe Ciccolo, Founder of the U.S. based BitAML, which provides regulatory compliance solutions for digital currency startups, sees various pockets of state-by-state regulation as anathema to the purpose of the EU. \u201cState-level licensure has delayed growth and innovation in the United States, and has placed the country at a disadvantage when compared to its peers. The EU appears interested in raising its barriers to entry to match that of the U.S.\u201d\nHe goes on to note that the U.S. and EU appear to be switching their trajectory on licensure. \u201cIn the U.S., regulators and lawyers have been working on piecing together a national license regime or limited charter to alleviate the burden of state-by-state licensing. Meanwhile, the EU appears to be transitioning from a single member-based licensing approach to a country-by-country approach.\u201d\nPawe\u0142 Kuskowski, CEO and Co-Founder of the compliance and verification platform Coinfirm is on the advisory board of the International Compliance Association, a group responsible for developing knowledge about rules and regulations regarding compliance and AML in Central and Eastern Europe, building international cooperation in the region. Kuskowski says that new EU regulations will put almost the same standards on digital currency entities as current standards for traditional financial concerns. He feels that the crypto and blockchain market is not ready to comply since compliance typically encompasses large investment and ongoing costs, if done in the traditional way. This, he notes, may mean that certain exchanges and wallets could be pushed out of the market.\nSays Kuskowski: \u201cIn a lot of our discussions with clients and companies in the ecosystem we find that they are spending up to 25 percent of their time and pouring enormous amounts of money into compliance. This is not acceptable. At the end the day, businesses should be able to focus on doing business, serving clients, and developing new products as opposed doing compliance.\u201d\nDespite the challenges these developments are creating for the digital currency landscape, Kuskowski also believes that there is a case to be made for regulatory efforts aimed reducing criminal activity and keeping our world safe. \u201cWhether we like it or not, the sector needs regulations to protect the customer and to limit money laundering and terrorist financing. This is a certainty and we see this in Europe with the EU AML Directive and we\u2019re seeing it with the OCC and IRS. Despite having the effect of stunting and damaging the growth of the digital currency ecosystem and creating regulatory uncertainty, I do believe all of this will ultimately provide a clearer path towards commercial and institutional adoption and growth.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 5}

(In fact, transactions with lower fees or even no fee at all were often included as well.)\nWith the increased competition for block space, a fixed 0.1 mBTC fee is often insufficient to have a transaction included in the next block; it gets outbid by transactions that include higher fees. While even a low fee transaction will probably confirm eventually, it can take a while.\nTry increasing the fee\nIf you want to have your transaction confirmed faster, the obvious solution is to include a higher fee.\nIf your wallet (by default) includes an insufficient fee, you may be able to adjust the fee manually, either as part of the wallet settings, or when you send a transaction. (Or both.)\nWebsites like\u00a021.co monitor the network and suggest how much of a fee you should include per byte, as well as how fast you can expect your transactions to confirm at different fee levels.\nIf you need the payment to go through in the next block or two, you need to pay a higher fee. For less urgent payments, you can include a lower fee; it will just take a bit longer to confirm.\nCheck if your wallet includes dynamic fees\nThese days, most wallets support dynamic fees. Based on data from the Bitcoin network, these wallets automatically include a fee that is estimated to have a transaction included in the next block, or maybe in one of the first blocks after that.\nSome wallets also let you choose the fee priority. Again, higher fees let your transactions confirm faster, lower fees could make it take a bit longer.\nIf transactions from your wallet are often delayed during peak hours, and you have no option to adjust to higher priority fees, your wallet is most likely outdated. Check if there is an update available, or switch to a new wallet.\nConsider switching wallets\nIf you do switch to a new wallet, you of course need to transfer funds from your old wallet to your new wallet. If you\u2019re not in a rush and don\u2019t mind paying the fee, you can just send it from your old wallet to the new wallet through the Bitcoin network. It will probably arrive eventually \u2014 even if the fee is low.\nIf you are in a rush, some wallets allow you to export your private keys or the private key seed, and then import them into the new wallet. This requires no transaction on the Bitcoin network. From the new wallet, you can immediately start transacting.\nAfter You\u2019ve Sent It\nIf you\u2019ve already sent a transaction and it gets stuck, that transaction can, in some cases, be made to \u201cjump the queue.\u201d\nOpt-in Replace-by-fee\nThe easiest way to make your transaction jump the queue is using an option called Opt-In Replace-by-Fee (Opt-In RBF). This lets you re-send the same transaction, but with a higher fee.\nIn most cases, when the same transaction is re-sent over the network, but with a higher fee, the new transaction is rejected by the network. Bitcoin nodes typically consider this new transaction a double spend, and will therefore not accept or relay it.\nBut when sending a transaction using Opt-In RBF, you essentially tell the network you may re-send that same transaction later on, but with a higher fee. As a result, most Bitcoin nodes will accept the new transaction in favor of the older one; allowing the new transaction to jump the queue.\nWhether your new transaction will be included in the very next block does depend on which miner mines that next block: not all miners support Opt-In RBF. However, enough miners support the option to, in all likelihood, have your transaction included in one of the next couple blocks.\nOpt-In RBF is currently supported by two wallets:\u00a0Electrum and\u00a0GreenAddress. Depending on the wallet, you may need to enable Opt-In RBF in the settings menu before you send the (first) transaction.\nChild Pays for Parent\nIf your wallet does not support Opt-In RBF, things get a bit more complex.\nChild Pays for Parent (CPFP) may do the trick. Applying CPFP, miners don't necessarily pick the transactions that include the most fees, but instead pick a set of transactions that include most combined fees.\nWithout getting into too many technical details, most outgoing transactions do not only send bitcoins to the receiver, but they also send \u201cchange\u201d back to you. You can spend this change in a next transaction.\nSome wallets let you spend this change even while it is still unconfirmed, so you can send this change to yourself in a new transaction. This time, make sure to include a high enough fee to compensate for the original low fee transaction. A miner should pick up the whole set of transactions and confirm them all at once.\nIf your wallet does not let you select which bitcoins to spend exactly \u2014 meaning you cannot specifically spend the unconfirmed change \u2014 you can try spending all funds in the wallet to yourself; this should include the change.\nLike Opt-In RBF, not all miners currently support CPFP. But enough of them do to probably have your transaction confirmed in one of the next blocks.\nOr...\nIf neither Opt-In RBF nor CPFP are an option, you can technically still try and transmit the original transaction with a higher fee. This is typically referred to as \u201cfull replace-by-fee,\u201d which some miners accept. However, publicly available wallets currently do not support this as an option.\nOtherwise, you may just have to wait either until the transaction confirms or until the bitcoins reappear in your wallet. It\u2019s important to note that until a transaction confirms, the bitcoins are technically still in your wallet \u2014 it\u2019s just that it often doesn\u2019t appear that way. The bitcoins are not literally \u201cstuck\u201d on the network and cannot get lost.\nUpdate: Since completion of this article, mining pool\u00a0ViaBTC started offering a \u201ctransaction accelerator\u201d. If your transaction is stuck and includes at least 0.1 mBTC fee per kilobyte, you can submit the transaction-ID to ViaBTC, and the pool will prioritize it over other transactions. Since ViaBTC controls about seven percent of hash-power on the Bitcoin network, there is a good chance it will find a block within a couple of hours. The service is limited to 100 transactions per hour, however.\nAs the Receiver\nOf course, a transaction can also get stuck if you\u2019re on the receiving end of it.\nIf your wallet allows spending unconfirmed transactions, this can be solved with CPFP as well. Much like as mentioned before, you can re-spend the unconfirmed, incoming bitcoins to yourself, including a fee high enough to compensate for the initial low fee transaction. If the new fee is sufficient, the transaction should typically confirm within a couple of blocks.\nThe only other option is to ask the sender whether he used Opt-In RBF. If so, he can re-send the transaction with a higher fee.\nUpdate: Of course, ViaBTC\u2019s transaction accelerator (mentioned above) works for incoming transactions as well.", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 6}

The organization claims that the Stellar network enables money to move directly between people, companies and financial institutions as easily as email, enabling more access for individuals, lower costs for banks, and more revenue for businesses.\nCoins.ph, a mobile financial services provider for the underbanked in Southeast Asia, has announced that its Stellar integration is now live. Starting today, people using a Stellar wallet can send global remittances to anyone in the Philippines or from any institution connected to the Stellar network.\nFlutterwave, a pan-African financial technology and services company, will use Stellar to support cross-border payments for M-Pesa, a mobile platform for money transfer and financial services used by 21 million people in Kenya. M-Pesa users will now be able to send payments regardless of whether they are based in Kenya, Ghana or Nigeria.\nIndian ICICI Bank will use the Stellar network to transfer money within India and internationally. The bank will launch a pilot program on Stellar for cross-border payments without traditional wire fees, as well as a mobile wallet application built on Stellar for university and office campuses. \u201c[Stellar] technology is enabling us to conduct business a lot quicker and cheaper, with lower error rates and lower vulnerability to cyber threats,\u201d said Raj Chowdhury, Head of ICICI Bank\u2019s blockchain initiative.\nTempo Money Transfer, a European-licensed remittance provider headquartered in Paris, is also integrating with the Stellar network. Users can now send remittances through Tempo to Europe, as well as to global financial institutions, such as Coins.ph in the Philippines, which are connected to the Stellar network.\n\u201cCoins.ph, ICICI, Flutterwave and Tempo are leading the charge to make blockchain real and bringing the benefits of the software to market\u201d said Jed McCaleb, CTO of Stellar.org. \u201cWhile they made the decision to integrate with Stellar because of efficiency and cost, these partnerships bring us closer to our goal of making money move as easily as email. This is the start of achieving our mission of enabling a worldwide financial network that anyone can use.\u201d\n\u201cA New Global Infrastructure for Payments\u201d\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to McCaleb to ask how Stellar wants to position itself in the fintech area, what makes the Stellar platform uniquely suitable for the remittance sector, and what applications are being envisaging by the Stellar team for other sectors with similar requirements.\n\u201cStellar is an internet level protocol for payments,\u201d McCaleb told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThe Stellar protocol can be used by any financial institution to easily send money to anyone else on the Stellar network. The Stellar network is open source and overseen by the Stellar Development Foundation, a nonprofit entity. Our goal is to position Stellar as a universally accessible payments standard that can be used by financial institutions, payments providers and people to send money globally. At Stellar, we want sending money to be more like sending email; easy, fast, low cost and accessible to everyone.\u201d\n\u201cFrom the beginning, the Stellar network was designed to serve as a new global infrastructure for payments,\u201d continued McCaleb. \u201cYou can think of it as an open source SWIFT-like network that allows connected organizations to transact with one another. As a unifying layer between all payments and currencies, Stellar is able to link siloed financial institutions and services, such as Coins.ph and Tempo, and reduce the friction that contributes to higher fees. Given the diverse nature of global financial services today, this interoperability can substantially lower global remittance costs by making transactions that cross national boundaries, currencies and financial institutions much more efficient. Transactions processed on the Stellar network take only three to five seconds to complete, and are extremely low cost regardless of the size of the payment amount \u2014 attributes that make the platform uniquely suitable for international remittances.\u201d\n\u201cAs an organization, Stellar is focused on creating a solution for payments, particularly international remittances,\u201d McCaleb explained to Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cHowever, the platform can certainly be used across other sectors. A great example of this would be B2B (business-to-business) payments, particularly for small and medium sized (SME) businesses processing international payments. In addition, B2E (business to employee) and G2C (government-to-consumer) payments are also easy-to-apply use cases for the Stellar network. In the B2B use case example, we are working with several large international development organizations which support or own microfinance banks, and are very interested in developing an effective payments product for their SME customers.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 7}

Worldwide, only 2 percent of the population possesses a mobile money account; in Africa, 12 percent of the population uses mobile money.\nAfrica\u2019s affinity for mobile money is one of the main reasons why many members of the Bitcoin community believe that the region is fertile ground for bitcoin adoption, especially to meet the needs of the large underbanked population that often relies on mobile money to send and receive payments.\nHowever, the reality is that African mobile money and e-payments adoption is heavily clustered towards specific countries and is not a continent-wide phenomenon. The vast majority of Africans still rely on cash to conduct their daily financial transactions.\nAccording to KPMG\u2019s\u00a0Payment Developments in Africa 2015 report, 94 percent of retail transactions in both urban and rural Africa are conducted in cash, which means that only 6 percent of transactions are made with bank cards or e-payment systems. Credit card adoption is notoriously low in Africa, whereas mobile payment systems are on the rise as more Africans have mobile phones than they do bank accounts. However, even mobile money and e-payment adoption is still in its early stages for most of the continent.\nLow Internet Penetration Delays\u00a0Adoption\nThe biggest challenge to e-payments adoption, and that includes bitcoin, is Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s low rate of internet use. Africa\u2019s internet penetration rate is currently at 28.7 percent. It is therefore no surprise that those countries with the highest internet adoption rates, such as South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya, also have the highest adoption of e-payment systems.\nAccording to\u00a0data collated by the World Bank, South Africa has an internet penetration rate of 51.9 percent, with Nigeria at 47.8 percent, Ghana at 23.5 percent and Kenya at 45.6 percent. These figures are in stark contrast with levels of internet use in some of Africa\u2019s largest countries, such as Angola with 12.4 percent, DR Congo with 3.8 percent, Tanzania at 5.4 percent and Mozambique with 9 percent.\nKenya is regularly highlighted as Africa\u2019s poster child for mobile money adoption, as\u00a086 percent of its households have mobile money accounts. With its M-Pesa mobile money service, Telecom giant Safaricom holds the lion\u2019s share of the Kenyan mobile money market.\nThe use of bitcoin to make payments, however, is virtually nonexistent in Kenya as there is effectively zero merchant adoption both on and offline. While bitcoin trading volumes are increasing according to\u00a0LocalBitcoins data, and the country\u2019s small bitcoin community is growing, the reality is that bitcoin in Kenya is more of a myth than a reality, as rightfully stated in a\u00a0VICE Motherboard article earlier this year.\nBitcoin awareness across Africa echoes the situation in Kenya. In most countries, there is a small bitcoin community and a handful of startups that are aiming to leverage bitcoin as an alternative store of wealth and a means to make international remittances. However, digital currency is still a big unknown to the vast majority of Africans. Until internet penetration increases across the board, this will likely remain the case in the years to come.\nSouth Africa Leads in Bitcoin Adoption\nThere is, however, one country that stands as a beacon of hope for bitcoin in Africa. South Africa boasts a small but vibrant bitcoin startup community and has a central bank that is friendly to the digital currency.\nSince 2014, South Africa is also home to Africa\u2019s first bitcoin ATM, which is located in Johannesburg. The city also acts as the base for several leading African bitcoin exchanges, such as\u00a0BitX and\u00a0Ice3x.\u00a0South Africans can even pay their utility bills using bitcoin, thanks to the fintech startup Bankymoon.\nHaving said that, even in South Africa bitcoin awareness levels are still low within the general population despite a relatively high level of internet penetration.\nCash Likely to Remain King in Africa\nCash remains the number one method of making and receiving payments in Africa and that is not likely to change anytime soon. While financial institutions and tech startups active in the payments space would like to see large-scale adoption of mobile money and other digital payments systems, the reality is that \u2014 due to low internet penetration and a lack of trust in the financial system \u2014 Africans will likely stick to cash for the time being.", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 7}

We obviously envisioned it as a mainstream phenomenon and we had expected more progress in terms of technology development, but the development has slowed in the last three years.\"\nAllaire seems dissatisfied with the overall state of the Bitcoin system. \u201cThe story is one of essentially gridlock amongst core developers, while mainstream companies are using this technology,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been deeply frustrated with that lack of progress, and we want to move it forward.\u201d\nCircle\u2019s announcement is more sober and factual, and less sensationalized, than the WSJ headline. The company is not \u201cpulling the plug on Bitcoin\u201d \u2014 only on bitcoin trading, Circle\u2019s customers will continue to be able to receive, send and hold bitcoin, but they will have to use alternative options to trade bitcoin.\n\u201c[We are] eliminating the ability for customers to buy and sell bitcoin directly on Circle, and introducing a new preferred bitcoin exchange partnership with Coinbase,\u201d say Allaire and Sean Neville, Circle Co-Founder and President in the joint post. \u201cConsumers who seek to buy and sell bitcoin in the future may now leverage our new preferred partnership with Coinbase. Customers may still send their bitcoin to any wallet or exchange of their choosing, but Coinbase is our recommended consumer bitcoin exchange.\u201d\nHowever, Circle\u2019s announcement does seem to mean that the company is de-emphasizing bitcoin and considering it as just one of many options for backend blockchain-mediated transactions. Besides bitcoin, Circle users have the ability to hold funds in U.S. dollars, euros or British pounds, depending on their location. According to the company, blockchain-aided payments in traditional currencies have been growing much faster than bitcoin payments on the Circle platform. Circle plans to continue using bitcoin and other digital tokens behind the scenes to settle transactions in traditional currencies.\nNew Focus on Social Payments\nThe main focus of Circle\u2019s announcement is on Circle apps for the web, iOS and Android, now updated with messaging features and a new emphasis on social payments.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve rolled out new messaging capabilities to all Circle customers across all of our apps on the web, iOS and Android,\u201d say Allaire and Neville. \u201cWe\u2019ve long argued that social payments are best experienced in the context of the conversations and interactions we have with friends, colleagues, family members and individual sellers. Messaging provides context for a payment, whether that be with a funny image, a photo of a meal shared, a moment from a night out, or a picture of the product someone is selling.\u201d\nIn other words, Circle is trying to position its apps as social messaging platforms \u2014 like WeChat, Messenger, or WhatsApp \u2014 but with built-in payments via Circle\u2019s network. The transaction history between two users is stored in a single conversation, a feature that is also available for Apple\u2019s iMessage in iOS 10.\nIntroducing Spark\nCircle is also launching a new blockchain technology dubbed Spark: a protocol for digital wallets to exchange value using blockchains, including bitcoin, as settlement layers. According to Circle, Spark, which the company plans to open-source and make available to wallet developers, is designed to offer a seamless wallet-to-wallet payment experience that reflects local currency exchange rates while ensuring full KYC/AML compliance.\nCircle is initially deploying Spark within the framework of two new partnerships with Korea\u2019s Korbit and the Philippines\u2019 Coins.ph, two digital currency operators that will connect to Circle and leverage the Spark APIs to serve their local markets and currencies.

One example is Spells of Genesis (SoG), a blockchain-based mobile card trading game, that is scheduled to soft launch in Canada and Switzerland this month.\nIn October, creators of Spells of Genesis, the Swiss-based\u00a0EverdreamSoft, teamed up with\u00a0All 4 Games, the mobile video game arm of Channel 4 Television based in Glasgow. The partnership has contributed \u201csignificant and welcome improvements to Spells of Genesis\u201d thanks to the \u201cexperience with mobile games and attention to detail\u201d of All 4 Games, said Shaban Shaame, CEO and founder of EverdreamSoft.\nTone Brennan, executive producer of All 4 Games, said that partnering with the Switzerland-based developer \u201cwas all a matter of seizing a new opportunity,\u201d especially in terms of promoting blockchain awareness.\n\u201cIf we give gamers the chance to play a great game that has the blockchain as a core element of its economy, then that might help players to take their first steps into the digital currency world,\u201d said Brennan.\nAsset Ownership\nA key component of Spells of Genesis is its commitment to true asset ownership. Gaming assets \u2014 SoG\u2019s signature trading cards \u2014\u00a0are tied to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. These colorful trading cards, with artwork that allegorically represents larger themes or entities in the digital currency and blockchain industries, also have real world value that can be recorded as the cards are traded, bought and sold.\nShaame said, \u201cWe want to set a new paradigm, not only for the gaming industry, but for the economy at large. An economy of peer-to-peer trades, decentralization of companies, projects and patrimony.\"\nTo facilitate this sort of peer-to-peer trading and individual asset management, Everdreamsoft teamed up with Tokyo-based IndieSquare to release the Book of Orbs, a mobile wallet that allows users to create and manage blockchain assets via tokens called ORBS (Ownership Revolution on the Blockchain). Tokens are created via Counterparty, a blockchain protocol that extends Bitcoin\u2019s functionality. \u00a0Furthermore, ORBS are interoperable among other blockchain-based games, allowing for\u00a0cross-game capability among card trading games like Force of Will (FoW) and SoG.\n\u201cAnything that gives players more flexibility and ownership of the things they enjoy is a good thing for them and for us,\u201d said Brennan. \u201cThe gaming environment is already very disruptive with constant changes, shifts, and innovations in how people behave in the digital world so I\u2019d expect this to continue.\u201d\nImproved Gameplay\nSpells of Genesis isn\u2019t just about promoting the advantages of blockchain technology and ownership of digital assets, according to Brennan. The gameplay experience is its real driving force.\n\u201cWhat we saw in Spells of Genesis was a nice combination of an authentic fantasy battler combined with a challenging but easy-to-grasp gameplay mechanic,\u201d said Brennan.\nSince All 4 Games joined forces with EverdreamSoft to prepare Spells of Genesis to launch, a great amount of polish and refinement has gone into finalizing a quality product that will appeal not just to gamers in the blockchain space, but also to the mainstream gaming community.\n\u201cThe core gameplay already felt good,\u201d said Brennan, \u201cbut seeing the beautiful map screen go in and the more balanced levels appearing as we get closer to launch has really helped it come to life.\u201d\nShaame added: \u201cWe are confident our early supporters and potential new ones, will have a lot of fun playing the game as well as benefit from the advantages blockchain-based digital assets offer to the economy.\"\n\u201cIf the game is strong enough and the fans are passionate enough,\u201d \u00a0said Brennan, \u201cthen the peer-to-peer transactions [will] make sense.\u201d\nSpells of Genesis will be soft launching in Canada and Switzerland on December 13, with in-app purchases set to become available soon after. The current public release of the game is available to play online and as a manual Android install.", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 9}

The development community around the smart contract platform is growing, the project developed its own policy on hard forks, and as opposed to Ethereum, Ethereum Classic will probably not switch to (full) proof-of-stake mining anytime soon.\nAnd, in the biggest deviation\u00a0since the hard fork yet, Ethereum Classic could steer toward a radical economic change: a new monetary policy.\nAccording to Ethereum Classic\u2019s project coordinator, \u201carvicco\u201d:\n\u201cThe current unlimited emission schedule flies in the face of basic tenets of Austrian economics.\u201d\nNew Developments\nWhen Ethereum Classic first emerged, many wrote the initiative off as a joke, a pump-and-dump scheme, or at best a protest movement that would die off over time. Nearing the end of 2016, however, Ethereum Classic is doing better than even some of its initial proponents had expected.\nThough trading volume has\u00a0dropped off significantly since the early days, the classic ether (ETC) price holds relatively steady at around\u00a0$0.90 per token. With that, the Ethereum Classic market cap is worth more than 10 percent of Ethereum's, securing the altcoin a #6 spot on\u00a0CoinMarketCap.\nAnd \u2014 perhaps more importantly \u2014 development efforts have progressed as well. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, arvicco, owner of Russian digital currency news site bitnovosti.com and one of initiators of the project, explained:\n\u201cAt first, the Ethereum Classic volunteer development team was just one person, but now our GitHub includes 34 people with commit rights. In addition to that, Charles Hoskinson\u2019s\u00a0IOHK just announced it is committing a new development team to Ethereum Classic: \u2018The Grothendieck Team.\u2019 And core developer Igor Artamonov is forming a new professional team that will support core projects as well.\u201d\nEthereum Classic also found support from notable companies and people in the digital currency space, particularly in China. Major exchange, wallet service and mining pool\u00a0BTCC recently\u00a0announced it will enable ETC as a trading option. The Chinese\u00a0ETCWin project \u2014 a decentralized digital currency exchange \u2014 is the biggest Ethereum Classic ICO (Initial Coin Offering) to date. And Chinese investor Chandler Guo\u00a0plans to bootstrap the creation of 100 Ethereum Classic dApps (Decentralized Applications) in the next three years.\nOn a technical level, the Ethereum Classic community prides itself on\u00a0taking a more conservative approach, compared to what is described as Ethereum\u2019s \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d attitude, and still rejects editing changes to the ledger. As the clearest example of this policy since The DAO hard fork, Ethereum Classic did not implement the so-called \u201cSpurious Dragon\u201d hard fork.\nArvicco, who prefers to remain pseudonymous, explained:\n\u201cDuring the spam attacks that hit both Ethereum and Ethereum Classic in October, many millions of so-called \u2018null\u2019 accounts were created. These accounts don\u2019t have a state or a balance associated with them, but they still clog the blockchain and client memory. Some within the community felt that information about these accounts \u2014 even though they are malformed and appeared due to a bug \u2014 are still part of blockchain history. So Ethereum Classic didn\u2019t adopt that hard fork.\u201d\nAdditionally, the Ethereum Classic community is deploying its own hard fork to diffuse the \u201cdifficulty bomb\u201d in January. This difficulty bomb \u2014 originally implemented by the Ethereum Foundation \u2014 is set to increase Ethereum\u2019s mining difficulty exponentially over time. This ensures that mining becomes unprofitable, effectively \u201cfreezing\u201d the protocol so it can no longer be used. The Ethereum community will have to hard fork to a new version of the protocol, perhaps to introduce proof-of-stake mining: The bomb is designed to force their own hand.\nBut since Ethereum Classic is in no rush to switch to proof-of-stake mining, there is little need for the community to force its own hand; rather, it deems the difficulty bomb useless \u2014 even risky.\nMonetary Policy\nBut the biggest diversion away from Ethereum so far could be an upcoming change to Ethereum Classic\u2019s monetary policy.\nEthereum\u2019s emission schedule releases a stable amount of new tokens each year. The project started off with a 72 million ether premine, allocated to presale investors, the Ethereum Foundation, and developers. Since then, about 13 million new ethers are mined each year; theoretically forever.\nContinuing on the pre-forked chain, Ethereum Classic has an identical initial distribution and inflation schedule. But this could soon change.\n\u201cA monetized platform token is a key component of a blockchain system. Its function in the system is to align the economic incentives of all the key stakeholders: investors, users, miners and developers,\u201d said arvicco, explaining the rationale behind a potential adjustment. \u201cIn order to achieve monetization, an asset, first of all, needs two preconditions: utility and scarcity. With the inflation on the Ethereum blockchain, there will be a lot of tokens at any rate, and from a practical standpoint no token scarcity at all.\u201d\nThe leading proposal to replace the current monetary policy is\u00a0ECIP-1017 (Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposal 1017), drafted by Matthew \u201csnaproll\u201d Mazur. Much like Bitcoin's situation, ECIP-1017 would put a hard cap on the total amount of tokens to be issued. Specifically, it is \u201ctithing\u201d a 20 percent reward reduction about every 2 years, so the supply will\u00a0level off at some 200 million ETC around the year 2070 \u2014 with a hard cap of around 210 million ETC. The first tithing should occur at the 5 millionth block, scheduled to be mined a little less than a year from now.\nBut ECIP-1017 \u2014 which requires a hard fork \u2014 does not have consensus quite yet. And whether the community will be able to reach consensus on such a substantial change, of course, remains to be seen.\n\u201cWe are doing trying to reach and measure consensus to the best of our abilities, and so far the sentiment is predominantly supportive of the change. But there is only one ultimate measure of community agreement: for developers to offer code, and for the community to run it,\u201d arvicco said.\nAs part of an effort to reach consensus, the Ethereum Classic community is organizing a\u00a0meetup to discuss monetary policy in London this evening. Panelists include founding director of the Bitcoin Foundation, Jon Matonis; digital currency angel investor, Alistair Milne;\u00a0Epiphyte CEO & Founder Edan Yago; and director at the\u00a0British Bankers Association, Matt Herbert.", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 13}

Takara, the first ever bitcoin geocaching iOS app, is also part of the Book of Orbs network and allows players to pick up bitcoin anywhere in the world.\nHigashi states that game players will have true ownership of their in-game items with decentralized peer-to-peer trading of tokens.\n\u201cUsers can securely trade their game items with each other without a need for middlemen,\u201d he said.\nAugmentors, the augmented reality game that is backed by the Bitcoin blockchain, is a game title that is expected to join the Book of Orbs platform.\nCross-Game Capability\nWith the creation of the Book of Orbs, the ORBs were developed so that they are interoperable between games and apps. As game items live on the open blockchain, cross-game promotion and collaboration through tokens becomes easier, says Higashi.\n\u201cFor example, some of the FoW cards will be playable in SoG, and another example is through Takara [where] tokenized game items can be dropped and picked up on the map.\u201d\n\"The ORBs are truly the premise of a whole shift for the game industry,\u201d EverdreamSoft CEO Shaban Shaame told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cBook of Orbs is an opportunity for players to have \"true ownership\" of their digital game asset. We were amazed by how many people are collecting ORBs and using the app so far. The blockchain guarantees the scarcity of limited game assets making them valuable, exchangeable and tradable not only within their respective games, but in the real world too.\"\nHigashi believes that this open platform of game items on the blockchain is likely to create many new and exciting phenomena across many different games and services.\nThe team expects to add more games in the future as big and small gaming companies realize the potential of game items on the blockchain. By bringing back the ownership of game items to players, Higashi and the team are hopeful that they can pioneer this new open interoperable paradigm of gaming on the blockchain.\nThe idea is that, as more games join the Book of Orbs network, the mobile app will be able to expand on each one, providing new interactions between the various games involved.\n\u201cThis will potentially bring millions of new users to the ecosystem and help push the whole Bitcoin industry forward,\u201d Higashi said.", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 8}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nA new report from Coin Center examines the \u201cblockchain\u201d buzzword to help regulators avoid all the noise and get down to the implications of the various financial technologies that have been inspired by Bitcoin. In the report, which was authored by Coin Center\u2019s Peter Van Valkenburgh, permissionless blockchains are described as essential to the future of the internet.\nThe report points out that the most useful aspects of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain technology are not found in consortium-based solutions \u2014 at least when targeting specific applications, such as electronic cash. According to the report, the consensus mechanisms used by these systems are what differentiate them from each other.\nBlockchains Won\u2019t Cure All of Your Ailments\nTo many, \u201cblockchain technology\u201d is a vague and undefined buzzword. Many of the largest banks in the world have snubbed Bitcoin but embraced the technology that underlies the peer-to-peer digital cash system; however, the report notes that a distinction needs to be made between open\u2013 and closed-consensus mechanisms.\nAccording to the Coin Center report, the phrase \u201cblockchain technology\u201d is viewed as a loaded term that turns real technical innovations into generalized cures for problems found in any industry. \u201cThe phrase suggests a vague design pattern, which is then trumpeted as the solution to all manner of societal and organizational problems,\u201d reads the report. \u201cAnd amongst all of this cheerleading, almost nothing is ever offered in the way of real design specifics.\u201d\nStatements like these echo those often expressed on Bitcoin Uncensored, a podcast that often pokes fun at the lack of substance found in various blockchain-related projects. The intent of this report, on the other hand, is to offer clear, specific details to a wider audience.\nConsensus Mechanisms Are What Matter\n\u201cConsensus mechanisms . . . are the truly disruptive, interesting, and critical component of the design,\u201d reads the report. And these mechanisms are the aspect of blockchain technology that merits the largest amount of focus.\nThe report explores proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, and social consensus mechanisms, as well as closed, consortium models. It notes that open consensus mechanisms are superior to closed systems from an innovation policy perspective due to the fact that no permission is required to build or run applications built on top of them.\n\u201cIn an open consensus mechanism anyone with a computer and an internet connection should be eligible to play a role in writing consensus data; in a closed consensus mechanism only those who have been identified by a centralized authority and given an authorization credential are allowed to participate,\u201d notes the report.\nOpen Blockchain Tokens Are as Good as Cash\nDue to the limitations of closed blockchains (or closed consensus mechanisms as the report calls them), some specific applications may be better suited on open, permissionless systems. One of the key applications of these sorts of systems up to this point (and perhaps the only one that has gained marginal use) has been digital cash \u2014 mainly through the use of Bitcoin.\nThe report points out that closed-blockchain money transmission systems do not simply work without any added effort from the end user. \u201cI cannot send or receive money until I open an account and establish a legal relationship with a company,\u201d explains the report.\nThe fact that users are unable to accept tokens on a permissioned blockchain without signing up for an account means that the system does not work like cash. Whenever a system requires permission from some other party in order to create accounts and send transactions, that system will be incompatible with a digital cash model by default.\nIt should be mentioned that even Bitcoin has not completely solved the issue of permissionless transactions. Due to the lack of advanced privacy features, the ability of bitcoin miners to censor specific transactions has not been completely abolished. Improvements in this area are in the works, but it hasn\u2019t been a major issue up to this point.\nHaving said that, Bitcoin should, in theory, be in a much better position to act as a digital cash system than a blockchain controlled by a consortium of trusted signatories. \u201cOnly open consensus mechanisms, by fully automating the creation and maintenance of a ledger according to pre-established rules and economic incentives, can offer electronic transactions that are as good as cash,\u201d says the report.", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 14}

In particular, the Deloitte VTC will provide members \u2014 expected to range from university projects through to startups, SMEs and public companies \u2014 with opportunities for commercial partnerships or investment, and access to the global supply chains of large firms.\n\"We have long recognized the importance of connecting digital capabilities and innovative technologies with healthcare providers to accelerate the pace of the digitization,\u201d said Deloitte Partner Julian Hunt. \u201cThe Virtual Technology Cluster model stood out for us as it focused on enabling the acceleration of digital capability, innovative capacity and investment opportunities in the healthcare sector and wider economy.\u201d\nHunt mentioned the Lockheed Martin VTC, launched in 2015 to promote innovative cybersecurity and other technology solutions developed in the U.K., as a success story. \"We were impressed by the success of the Lockheed Martin U.K. Virtual Technology Cluster being a practical example of connectivity delivering accelerated competitive advantage,\" he said.\n\"We are delighted to partner with Deloitte on the creation of our second VTC, which will help advance the digitization of healthcare for the NHS and further afield. We are keen to replicate the success of our first cluster, the Lockheed Martin (now Leidos) Virtual Technology Cluster, which is focused on cybersecurity,\u201d said VTC Group CEO Auriol Stevens. \"In Deloitte we have a multinational organization, passionate about enhancing the quality of healthcare through technology, with whom we can work to create an ecosystem that will lead to revenue and investment opportunities for all constituents.\u201d\nStevens, who manages the Lockheed Martin VTC and was appointed CEO and Director of the VTC Group in July 2015, added that connecting innovation developers with corporate operators will help in achieving a better healthcare environment for the benefit of patients.\nThe creation of the Deloitte VTC seems especially interesting in view of the current emphasis on innovative blockchain solutions for the healthcare industry. Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Stevens to find out more about the role that distributed ledger technology companies can be expected to play in the Deloitte VTC.\nStevens considers blockchain-based security solutions as especially relevant for the Deloitte VTC, and anticipates that blockchain technology will \u201cabsolutely\u201d have a key role to play in the company. \u00a0\n\u201cSecure information exchange is as important in healthcare as in finance \u2014 personal data has a price tag attached to it, and where we are trying to encourage information sharing, this needs to be done in a completely secure way,\u201d she told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThe exact application will be dependent on what our corporate sponsors are looking to solve / provide for their customers.\n\u201cA large corporate interested in the technology should see the Deloitte VTC as a way of accessing curated market information, and therefore make informed choices around what type of technology to adopt, rather than investing time and money in something because they feel they have to to keep up with trends,\u201d continued Stevens.\nShe went on to explain that participation in the Deloitte VTC can bring benefits to both end users and technology providers. \u201cBlockchain innovators who have technology or skills and capabilities in this area will become members of the Deloitte VTC to try and find opportunities for revenue generation with our sponsoring corporates,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cThey will also have access to a virtual ecosystem of like-minded individuals, and industry experts in the law, finance, business development and the like. Membership is free and no relocation is required.\u201d\nOf course, funding is one of the big problems that emerging technology innovators have to face. According to Stevens, membership in the Deloitte VTC could \u201cpotentially\u201d facilitate access to funding.\n\u201cMembers of the Lockheed Martin (now Leidos) Virtual Technology Cluster found that access to finance was made easier by their participation in the cluster, as they were able to generate revenue \u2014 very attractive to funders,\u201d she said. \u201cAdvice can be given around potential suitable funding streams for members by the VTC Group and/or the industry experts.\u201d\nStevens concluded by saying that she sees a role for blockchain technology in other VTC projects besides Deloitte. \u201cIts application is wide and, if our corporate sponsors of other clusters want to access these types of technologies, we would like to bring them into our ecosystem,\u201d she said.\nIn related news that affirms Deloitte\u2019s interest in distributed ledger technology, the firm has also announced a partnership with blockchain company SETL to develop financial blockchain applications.", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 15}
{"title": "Combining Gold Assets With the Blockchain \u2014 and Bitcoin", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/combining-gold-assets-with-the-blockchain-britain-s-royal-mint-and-vaultoro-1481752218/", "birthday": "Dec 14, 2016  4:50 PM EST", "date": "2016-12-14 21:50:00", "content": "News of the recent collaboration between Britain's Royal Mint and Chicago-based derivatives exchange CME Group has renewed conversations regarding the intersection between blockchain technology and gold assets. This relationship has led to the creation of an innovative and cost-effective approach to the trading, executing and settling of gold transactions worldwide.\nScheduled to launch in 2017, Royal Mint Gold (RMG), as it is known, will provide an alternative to the physical spot-cost model of gold investing that levies management fees and ongoing storage charges. Once fully operational, RMG\u2019s model will offer its customers a blockchain-based digital record of gold ownership that allows for the option of physical conversion with no storage costs.\nThis development follows the efforts of a number of private bullion dealers to leverage the unique features of blockchain technologies for their online sites. It reflects blockchain\u2019s ability to adroitly track and authenticate data, secured by a global ecosystem of computers which ensure that recorded transactions are tamper resistant and unalterable.\nPreventing the manipulation or fraudulent alteration of records is one of the major reasons why a blockchain solution for managing gold assets is so appealing. The bullion industry is particularly vulnerable to fraud on the part of bad actors \u2014 also one of the reasons why some online gold dealers have resorted to using bitcoin as a means of thwarting chargeback purchases.\nDespite promising assertions supporting the integration of emerging blockchain solutions for gold assets, Ashe Whitener, an economist with a background in gold and digital currencies remains reticent. Says Whitener: \u201cIn my opinion, this is only news because the Royal Mint is basically a government-owned entity experimenting with blockchain. Just because something tangible like gold has a serial number on a blockchain, doesn't mean that it is any more secure, safe or less risky. Since the underlying asset is still physical, we still must place our trust with the Mint in terms of vaulting the gold. So nothing here really changes.\"\nVaultoro\u2019s Gold on the Blockchain\nLondon-based Vaultoro.com is reputed to be the world\u2019s first bitcoin to physical gold trading platform. This allows consumers to use bitcoin to buy fully audited and insured bullion that\u2019s secured in a top-tier vaulting facility in Switzerland. The value proposition for customers is that they are able to steer clear of traditional banking and fiat systems. This allows them to remain liquid with their gold purchases without worry if something happens to the Euro or the banking system. Because the gold is allocated in a customer\u2019s name as their legal property and is not listed on Vaultoro\u2019s balance sheet, it cannot be accessed by outside parties.\nJosh Scigala, Co-Founder and CEO of Vaultoro, believes that the blockchain offers superior functionality over other protocols because of its transparency. Says Scigala: \u201cI, along with many other people, lost a lot of money when MtGox collapsed even though they held it in fiat. This is because when you have fiat in a bank, it is not your property anymore. It is a promise to pay you back. This loss inspired me to create the most transparent exchange in the industry by having the counter asset be allocated in gold instead of fiat, which every other exchange was doing. With Vaultoro, the gold is held in a bailment contract. This allows us to use the blockchain to jump in and out of the gold, even down to 5-cent levels.\u201d\nConsumers\u2019 biggest concern and fear when purchasing gold online, notes Scigala, is that their gold purchase will not find its way to the vault. This is why Vaultoro has partnered with Pro Aurum Switzerland, one of the largest and most established vaulting facilities in Europe. The facility is audited by BDO International, one of the largest auditors in the world, and is fully insured against theft and damage.\nOne of Vaultoro\u2019s main strategic advantages is a concept Scigala refers to as \u201creal-time, glass books public auditing,\u201d where anyone can verify whether Vaultoro is operating at full reserves. This protocol, he says, was heavily inspired by the bitcoin blockchain and its pseudonymous public keys.\nEvery user receives an anonymous ID that allows them to log in and out of Vaultoro. When they log out, they can check the page where every anonymous ID is published and access their current bitcoin and gold holdings. This allows them to ensure that their holdings are correct and then see the sum of all users\u2019 holdings. They can also see Vaulting Facility statements, as well as auditor certificates from the BDO and insurance paperwork.\n\u201cThis is a very elegant way of making our exchange entirely transparent with full proof of 100 percent reserve, while keeping users private,\u201d said Scigala. \u201cOur next step is to publish every single trade onto the blockchain so that there is always a provable snapshot of the user holdings every 10 minutes.\u201d\nAnother concern for many customers is about not having physical possession of the gold. \u201cI often tell people that if you want to know the risk of something, talk to an insurance company, because their whole business is about statistical risk assessment and pricing. It is far, far, far more expensive to protect gold stored at your home, than it is to insure it in a world class, high security, fully audited, professional vaulting facility. Not only that, but when gold is stored with Vaultoro, the customer has instant liquid access to it. And, of course, a request for physical delivery or gold pickup can always be made with Vaultoro, if they choose.\u201d\nDespite calls in some circles for gold being backed by bitcoin, Scigala holds a different view. \u201cIn my opinion, we do not need to back a token with gold because bitcoin is so fast you can jump in and out of allocated gold very quickly, and it gets around [convenience] issues. You can just convert to gold when you want to and outsource the currency side to the bitcoin protocol.\u201d\nConcludes Scigala: \u201cWe at Vaultoro have worked hard to get past the blockchain hype and make people realize that it's the currency of bitcoin that is so cool. The blockchain and proof of work is amazing but decentralized currency and issuance on the blockchain is even cooler and makes gold relevant again as a money.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 14}

The eight hour online fundraiser set a $14,000 target to offset expenses tied to Ulbricht\u2019s court appeal. The event surpassed all expectations by yielding $50,000 from contributors around the world. The largest donation, in the amount of $25,000, came from Bitcoin angel investor and spirited advocate Roger Ver.\nAfter being convicted of seven non-violent charges, Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison without parole in May of 2015 for his alleged role in orchestrating the Silk Road website. He is currently appealing his conviction and sentence\u00a0in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\u201cThe idea that anyone could receive a life sentence for creating an ecommerce website, regardless of the products being sold, shocks the conscience,\u201d Ver said to Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cAny moral person should be opposed to this kind of draconian sentence.\u201d\nThe fundraiser follows recent evidence gathered by Ulbricht\u2019s legal team alleging proof of evidence tampering. A previously undiscovered copy of the Silk Road forum database clearly shows that someone with access to the site deleted significant portions of evidence, according to Ulbricht\u2019s lawyers. This new revelation has added another twist to a case already saddled with unsubstantiated details and questionable conclusions.\nThe legal team also discovered proof that someone other than Ulbricht used the Dread Pirate Roberts account to log into the site nearly seven weeks after Ulbricht was taken into custody. This contradicts assertions by the government that Ulbricht was the sole user of the Dread Pirate Roberts account.\nSays Lyn Ulbricht, Ross\u2019 mother: \u201cIf this backup of the forum database had not been found; if logins made by DPR after Ross' arrest were not discovered, no one would be the wiser. This begs the question: how much more is there? We may never know, as digital evidence is easily changed, planted or deleted without a trace. That my son \u2014 or anyone \u2014 would receive a life sentence based on such vulnerable evidence, especially when there is proof of corruption and tampering, is a travesty of justice.\u201d\nIn an earlier exclusive interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Lyn shared details of Ross\u2019s imprisonment, including contents of a letter he\u2019d written to her from prison.\nJeffrey Tucker, Distinguished Fellow with the Foundation for Economic Education and Chief Liberty Officer and founder of Liberty.me, also weighed in on the significance of this case:\n\u201cI was very grateful to be part of the Ross-A-Thon. From the time of his trial and sentencing, he has never left our minds. No justice is served by locking him up like this. The sentence alone, based on incompletely and strangely distorted information, was cruel to the point of absurdity. Meanwhile, the aims of the war on drugs have been in no way advanced by this.\u201d\n\u201cRoss is an idealist, a man who wanted to create a truly free market. Human liberation was his aim. He might have been naive concerning the challenge he set up for government officials and entrenched drug lords. But his solution is the way of the future. In that sense, he is a great innovator. A society that locks up such people is not a just one.\u201d\n\u201cI commend everyone who continues to work for Ross's freedom. Like others, I'm convinced we will see it in our time, and that history will regard him as a political prisoner who overcame a terrible fate to live a triumphant and beautiful life. It's sad that something like this should ever happen. But perhaps his life will be seen \u2014 as with so many political prisoners before \u2014 as a warning sign to all societies of the brutality of intolerance and ignorance.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 15}

As such, altcoins based on Bitcoin\u2019s codebase can take the code and implement the solution. Indeed, at least two altcoins are adopting SegWit:\u00a0Litecoin and\u00a0Viacoin.\nAnd it looks as if SegWit may activate on one of these altcoins before it\u2019s live on the Bitcoin network.\nSoft Fork\nWhile most agree that SegWit is generally a beneficial change to the Bitcoin protocol, some dispute that rolling out the upgrade as a soft fork is the best way forward. While a soft fork offers backwards compatibility and decreases the chance of a coin split, a hard fork can be slightly \u201ccleaner\u201d from a code perspective.\nCharlie Lee is the inventor of Litecoin, one of the oldest altcoins and still the most valuable Bitcoin fork. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Lee said he prefers SegWit as a soft fork, both for Bitcoin and Litecoin.\n\u201cI think Bitcoin Core is making the right trade-off to do SegWit as a soft fork,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt's a good balance between the hard fork risk and adding code complexity and code debt. For Litecoin, a hard fork is less risky because the community is smaller. So, if coming from a blank slate, it makes sense to do SegWit as a hard fork. But, it would cause Litecoin code to be less maintainable if it diverges from Bitcoin too much.\u201d\nCurrently placed at 121 on the CoinMarketCap digital currency index, Viacoin is a relatively small digital currency, but one with a notable history: Bitcoin Core developers BtcDrak and Peter Todd were previously involved with the project. Viacoin is now led by Romano, a Dutch programmer who prefers his surname to remain unknown.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Romano said SegWit\u2019s complexity is being exaggerated, and thinks the soft fork approach should work fine.\n\u201cSegWit itself is very simple,\u201d Romano said. \u201cA huge amount of the patchset are actually tests. There are other ancillary changes \u2014 for example to the peer-to-peer layer for compact block relay and peering \u2014 but SegWit is concise and easy to understand. It will also provide a much cleaner method of upgrading the scripting language after activation.\u201d\nBlock Size Increase\nAs perhaps the best known benefit, SegWit is set to offer an effective doubling of the block size limit \u2014 in Bitcoin\u2019s case from one to about two megabytes (per ten minutes). Any altcoin that implements SegWit would gain a similar benefit; whatever block size limit it now has will be roughly doubled.\nHowever, this is probably also the least useful feature for most altcoins. All altcoins experience a much lower transaction volume than Bitcoin currently does; there is usually very little need for a block size limit increase at all.\nRegardless, Romano pointed out that SegWit offers more\u00a0benefits than just increased throughput.\n\u201cSegWit's main purpose isn\u2019t a capacity increase,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's fixing malleability, and making scripting more easy to upgrade, as well. And it also fixes some long-standing issues, like quadratic hashing. A bigger block size limit is a nice extra, but I think SegWit has merit all by itself. Once malleability is fixed, much more exciting things will be possible, like atomic swaps, bi-directional payment channels, and lightning networks.\u201d\nLee, who is also Director of Engineering at\u00a0Coinbase, agreed that SegWit will benefit Litecoin even if the effective block size limit increase proves irrelevant. Like Romano, Lee also pointed out that SegWit-enabled lightning networks could increase his coin\u2019s interoperability with Bitcoin.\n\u201cSegWit is mostly not a scalability feature. Scalability is a side benefit. Lightning networks require a malleability fix, and lightning networks will allow atomic cross-chain transactions. This would allow you to send litecoin on one end and receive bitcoin on the other end,\u201d Lee explained.\nActivation\nLitecoin as well as Viacoin may see SegWit live on their networks even before Bitcoin. Both have a SegWit release scheduled in a couple of weeks from now, possibly before the end of the year. And while both Lee and Romano agree that implementing SegWit is not that difficult, code review can take some time.\nFurthermore, not unlike Bitcoin, the real challenge may be to get the community \u2014 and most importantly the miners \u2014 to adopt the change. While activation details differ slightly from coin to coin, SegWit will in each case ultimately require 95 percent hash power support.\nFor Viacoin, which previously activated the CheckLockTimeVerify soft fork before Bitcoin did, Romano is hopeful the community may be quick to adopt this upgrade as well.\n\u201cViacoin has a smaller mining community, which could prove to be a benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cI think everyone is excited to see SegWit activated on Viacoin. But, of course, it is up to the ecosystem to adopt it.\u201d\nThat said, one of the biggest mining pools on the Viacoin network is F2Pool. Also active on the Bitcoin network, the Chinese pool currently isn\u2019t signaling support for SegWit. When recently asked by Bitcoin Magazine, F2Pool operator Wang Chun\u00a0indicated it may take until spring before he signals support for SegWit on Bitcoin.\nFor Litecoin, moreover, several of the major pools required for the upgrade\u2019s success are the same pools active on the Bitcoin network. This once again includes F2Pool, and also BW Pool and AntPool \u2014 none of which are currently signaling support for SegWit on Bitcoin.\nBut according to Lee, who is currently discussing SegWit support with the miners, there is a chance they will signal support for the upgrade on Litecoin. And \u2014 as the \u201csilver to bitcoin\u2019s gold\u201d \u2014 succesful SegWit activation on Litecoin may even help convince Bitcoin miners to activate it on Bitcoin as well, Lee hopes.\n\u201cOne of the goals of Litecoin is to help experiment with things that are too hard to experiment with on Bitcoin,\u201d Lee said. \u201cUnfortunately, Bitcoin is deadlocked with SegWit versus Bitcoin Unlimited. I want to see Litecoin help break that deadlock in one way or another. That means we have to take a risk: if SegWit activates on Litecoin but doesn't on Bitcoin after a year, our codebase could be very different. I'm willing to take this risk to help move things forward: for Litecoin, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 12}

Founded by Marc Degen and Malik El Bay, Modum.io combines sensor devices and blockchain technology to make the pharmaceutical supply chain more efficient. Modum.io had already received $20,313 (CHF 20,000) in support from the Kickstart Accelerator for the development of its product.\nLocated 20 minutes from the crypto valley in Zug, the team at Modum.io are developing a blockchain technology-based temperature tracking system for medicinal products, in partnership with Prof. Dr. Burkhard Stiller, Dr. Thomas Bocek and the Communication Systems Group (CSG) of the University of Zurich.\nA recent change under the EU regulation,\u00a0Good Distribution Practice of Medicinal Products for Human Use (GDP 2013/C 343/01), means that companies are required to report any deviations \u2014 such as, in temperature \u2014 to the distributor and the recipient of the affected medicinal products; however, at present, the only way to comply is to employ refrigeration trucks that make up a significant part of cold chain distribution. These trucks can be four to eight times more expensive than normal logistic services, according to Malik El Bay, CEO of Modum.io, who spoke to Bitcoin Magazine.\n\u201cThe catch is that 60 percent of all 200 million yearly shipments in the EU do not contain temperature sensitive products,\u201d he said. \u201cSo right now we are wasting $3 billion for unnecessary cooling.\u201d\nAs the only system that currently complies 100 percent with all EU guidelines concerning the distribution of medicinal products, the Modum.io system is providing a solution to substantially cut these delivery costs.\nAccording to El Bay, there are three temperature categories that medicine needs to be stored at: cold, at -20\u00b0C; cool, at 2\u00b0-8\u00b0C; and ambient, at 15\u00b0-25\u00b0C. The team at Modum.io are focusing on the ambient products.\n\u201cEven though every product belongs to one of the aforementioned categories, it has specific so-called stability data,\u201d he said. \u201cThis data states that it can stay for X hours in temperature range Y, [which is] usually 72 hours between 2\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C.\u201d\nThus, instead of ordering a cold chain truck, medicinal shipments that do not require refrigeration are equipped with a Modum.io sensor, which monitors the temperatures of the products. Upon arrival at the destination, the data is transferred to the Ethereum blockchain \u2014 ensuring a tamper proof system with guaranteed data integrity \u2014 where a Solidity-based smart contract then compares the measurement data against various regulatory requirements.\nBased on the information, the product is either released, or both the sender and the receiver of the shipment receive a notification that a deviation occurred. If an out-of-specification occurs, for example if the temperature drops below 15\u00b0C for four hours, this data is then used to automate the release of medicinal products. El Bay states that this provides a cost-effective way of measuring the environmental conditions of every parcel containing drugs.\nSince the launch of Modum.io in April and the unveiling of its first pilot project in June, the team has received positive feedback from their pilot customers based in Switzerland. After improving their system and releasing a beta version, which has been live for a month, the team started an extended pilot processing 10 times more shipments than during the first pilot project. Their pilot customers have combined a shipping volume that exceeds 2.5 million yearly shipments.\n\u201c[The] fact is that until now there is no data concerning the shipment conditions at all,\u201d said El Bay. \u201cWith the Modum.io system, our customers learn more about the quality of their logistics providers.\u201d\nThis, however, is not the only project the team is working on. Modum.io is also looking at transactions further up the supply chain, where batches of active pharmaceutical ingredients are transported from CMOs to producers. According to El Bay, the challenges there include the transfer of ownership.\nWhile these discussions have begun between various pharmaceutical companies and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (Gavi) to find solutions to fight counterfeiting and fraud, the company\u2019s focus right now is bringing the Modum.io system to the market by July 2017, with a limited number of customers being able to track their shipments.\nRegarding the award, El Bay said that they were very honored to win it.\n\u201cIt is an acknowledgement for all the hard work we put into this company, as well as a confirmation of our strategy to enter the pharmaceutical supply chain with a cost cutting case,\u201d he said.", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 14}

By putting unique IDs on the blockchain and embedding each product with an NFC (Near Field Communication) chip, RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tag or QR (Quick Response) code, all of which can verify whether an item is genuine or not, VeChain provides an opportunity for different enterprises to easily create, manage, maintain and update shared data.\nBitSE COO Sunny Lu told Bitcoin Magazine that the VeChain launch is a symbolic moment, not just for BitSE but for the whole industry.\n\u201cWe found the right path to apply blockchain technology,\u201d Lu said. \u201cThe best way to know if a technology is impacting the world is by seeing if that technology can be monetized, and even before the launch we had signed some contracts with clients.\u201d\nBitSE is hoping to achieve three objectives with the launch of VeChain.\nFirst, by putting unique IDs on the blockchain, they want to apply blockchain technology to creating a transparent supply chain. VeChain can solve issues related to counterfeit products, through tracking and tracing merchandise, communication and cooperation among different parties in the supply chain, and supervision by government agencies, to name a few.\nOnly last month at Shanghai\u2019s Fashion Week, BitSE\u2019s VeChain project teamed up with independent fashion label Babyghost to put fashion on the blockchain.\nBy doing so, they gave the fashion crowd a unique experience, linking the fashion world with the digital world, and giving customers the ability to discover product information about the clothing they buy.\n\u201cThis collaboration brought new meaning to Fashion Tech,\u201d Lu said. \u201cWe believe it fits perfectly into what the fashion industry needs \u2014 giving extraordinary and unique experiences to others.\u201d\nThe second objective BitSE wants to achieve through VeChain is to make a connection between the different IT systems that operate on the supply chain. Lu said that current IT systems are kept separate from one another, creating a lack of trust regarding the information among the various parties.\n\u201cWith VeChain, we can make a connected information system that will help automate much of the supply chain,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to enable the commercial world to do something they weren\u2019t able to do before and wouldn\u2019t be able to do without this platform.\u201d\nThirdly, they are attempting to increase the efficiency of the supply chain. At present, a lot of processes still run on paper, requiring a high amount of trust in the system. BitSE plans to integrate the flow of funds, information and goods, and to decentralize the trust aspect of trade.\nTeaming Up with PwC\nSpeaking at the recent Shanghai Conference, Elton Huang, Senior Partner for PwC\u2019s Shanghai office and the central markets leader, said that when choosing to work with a startup company, PwC looks to see what that company is working for: money, fame or a special mission.\n\u201cThe mission of PwC is to solve important problems and build up social credit,\u201d he said. \u201cPwC focuses on companies whose motivation is to solve important problems.\u201d\nAccording to Huang, there are three big blockchain-related opportunities for the partnership with BitSE: the opportunity for 400 million middle class consumers in the country to participate in anticounterfeiting, thus producing a boom in the economy; finding solutions to improve service efficiency; and the need for true industrial automation, including an industrial Internet of Things (IoT).\nLu said that BitSE decided to partner with PwC because, while BitSE has expertise in blockchain technology and applications, PwC has vast business resources and industry knowhow. As such, Lu believes it will be a very effective partnership.\nAlong with monitoring over 200 technologies globally \u2014 such as augmented reality, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, robotics and blockchain \u2014 PwC is eager to cooperate with BitSE and VeChain, which resulted in the signing of a strategic joint business relationship agreement on May 31 this year.\n\u201cBefore our partnership, we couldn\u2019t imagine what a disruptive force PwC could be with new technology,\u201d Lu adds. \u201cWe provided them with our blockchain knowledge, they provided us with their business experience, [and we have] engaged customers together and made significant progress delivering projects.\u201d\nPwC employs more than 200,000 people around the world, including nearly 10,000 people in China, and generates over $30 billion in yearly revenue. As it celebrates its 110th anniversary this year, there is the perception that PwC is too big to be innovative.\nHuang acknowledged change can be hard for a company as big as PwC. We live in an uncertain world with the elite controlling many of resources, he said. And yet, if you take the example of the financial industry, if the center is removed, we share one ledger.\n\u201cIn other words,\u201d he added, \u201call the information held by banks is not bank centric, but distributed and shared. You will find that the uncertainty of the world changes, [and that while] information between people is asymmetrical, with blockchain technology that will change.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 29}

This would allow for the peer-to-peer (P2P) transfer of digital assets with effectively no verification time, a higher transactions-per-second (TPS) rate and almost no fees.\nColored Coins is an open source Bitcoin 2.0 protocol that enables developers to create digital assets on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. These can be used to issue financial assets and proofs of ownership, to store documents or to create smart contracts. Current projects leveraging the Colored Coins protocol include\u00a0Mycelium,\u00a0Swarm and DXMarkets.\nThe new version uses Lightning technology to transfer digital assets in payment channels and uses the Bitcoin blockchain as a settlement layer and dispute resolution mechanism that secures the assets.\nIn a new blog post released today, Colu's Co-Founder and Vice-President, Mark Smargon, wrote:\n\"The decentralized nature of the Lightning protocol is an excellent choice for scaling Colored Coins because it provides the functionality of a true P2P transaction layer that doesn\u2019t compromise security, and gives users control of their funds. Looking forward, we are excited about the possibility of being interoperable with all of the tools and services that adopt Lightning technology, as well as compatibility with other blockchains than Bitcoin as Lightning technology matures.\"\nThe\u00a0Lightning Network, a protocol for scaling and speeding up blockchains, was first proposed by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus \"Tadge\" Dryja well over a year ago. The payment layer utilizes Bitcoin's basic programmable features and allows users to establish networked payment channels on top of Bitcoin. It\u00a0promises to support a virtually unlimited number of off-chain transactions among users, at nearly no cost. Initially designed to solve some of the technical limitations of the Bitcoin blockchain, the Lightning Network protocol can be implemented on top of any blockchain.\nPrior to launching Colu, founders Amos Meiri, David Ring and Mark Smargon had worked on the Colored Coins project since 2012.\nThe team is now working with Lighting Labs to build overlaying protocols to create native compatibility with the official Lightning code, Smargon said.\nMeiri, Ring and Smargon launched Colu in 2014 to provide governments, businesses and consumers with the capabilities to create local digital currencies, and allow for the exchange of digital cash directly with one another.\nUsers engage via a mobile app, alongside a merchant dashboard containing comprehensive tools to manage transactions and discoverability features.\n\"Colu came about as a direct result of our previous venture, Colored Coins, which applies a blockchain digital-tag to assets, promoting decentralized control over the consumer transaction of goods,\" Colu's CEO and Co-Founder, Amos Meiri, told Bitcoin Magazine. \"After further development and deployment of the service, feedback and usage data indicated that 60 percent of use cases for the technology were for local currencies. Realizing the gap in the market for a secure local currency solution, we developed the Colu of today, creating a channel ... to build stronger urban economies and tight-knit communities through localized currencies. \"\nAccording to Meiri, local digital currencies in communities and cities can help \"stimulate local growth, adding value to every dollar that is reintroduced to a local market, create jobs, strengthen socio-economic potential, encourage positive community action and improve the payment network infrastructure by making it accessible to real users.\"\nDespite the apparent potential, local digital currencies are still in their infancy when it comes to the general public\u2019s understanding of the core benefits and the underlying technologies that make it possible, Meiri said.\nColu has already achieved significant milestones, having collaborated with fintech startup, Bitt, and the Central Bank of Barbados on the Barbadian Digital Dollar earlier this year, and getting established in Israeli cities like Tel Aviv through\u00a0the Pishpesh Shekel project in the Jaffa area, and the Florentin Shekel project in Florentin, Israel.\nOne of the company's latest achievements has been its debuts in Liverpool and the Camden area of London, a move that is part of Colu's expansion plans to move into the European market through the U.K. before tapping into the U.S. market.\n\"Entering into new markets is a point of pride as we take Colu to the next level and establish the company as a world leader in open source payments and an innovator in blockchain technologies,\" Meiri said.", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 16}

It reflects the continued movement away from a traditional wage model connected to a single corporate entity and locale to one that\u2019s untethered by geography or the nature of the work.\nAs this free agent model continues to expand, new approaches for connecting talent to work opportunities are being advanced. Moreover, blockchain technologies are opening up new possibilities for how talent is paid for project work, without the need for banks and other forms of financial middlemen.\nLeading this trend is an Australian-based company known as ChronoBank. The company\u2019s quest is to provide talented professionals with a new means of identifying and being compensated for work opportunities. Here, it seeks to disrupt the prevailing world of HR talent management in a manner similar to how the transportation networks Uber and Lyft have reinvented the taxi space.\nThis ambition is seen as the next iteration of what are known as \u201ctime-based currencies.\u201d It\u2019s a concept that has existed for nearly 200 years, with applied case studies having taken place via a small number of time-based economies. The still operating Ithaca Hours community currency in Ithaca, New York, is just one example of a pioneering effort in this space.\nChronoBank\u2019s innovative blueprint proposes a decentralized, intermediary-free ecosystem where talented people can sell their time and specialized value in a given field. Compensation will occur through the use of digital tokens in a private, time-based money system, where transactions happen between business and workers without third party interference.\nKnown as Labour-Hours (LH), these tokens represent the tradable resource for ChronoBank\u2019s time-based economy. They can be settled into BTC, ETH or fiat and will be accessible 24/7 via a LH debit card.\nAvailable on the Ethereum, Waves and Lisk blockchain networks, LH tokens will connect to the average hourly wage of a host country. The rate that a worker charges will be indexed according to what that a person normally charges: for example, if a Labour-Hour in Australia is $25 per hour and someone charges $100, then they would charge 4 x LHAU (Labour-Hour in Australia) for their hour of work.\nChronoBank is supported by a labor force network tied to large recruitment and talent management companies around the world. Labor hire, recruitment and HR partner companies are selected based on credibility, size, financial performance and other factors. The initial list of companies who agree to compensate workers with LH tokens include Anderson Recruitment and Training, Host Group/Host Labour Hire, AES Labour Hire, and Edway Labour Hire.\nAnother element of the ChronoBank platform, known as LaborX, represents a decentralized marketplace where people can market their labor hours for work and project opportunities. Users will also be able to track their Labour-Hour expenditures on LaborX via an online dashboard.\nAs a reputation system similar to Upwork, LaborX facilitates feedback for each worker, providing companies a efficient way to hire the most competent professionals from the online and offline worlds. ChronoBank.io assigns a reputation score based on the individual\u2019s experience with an initial project assignment. Those who have yet to participate will receive a nominal average reputation skill to get them started.\nFreelancers are therefore compensated based their skill level and value. The higher the score, the more they can command for an hour\u2019s worth of work.\nChronoBank is the brainchild of a community of professionals with over 100 years of combined recruitment experience. This community works with blockchain application experts to find real-world business solutions. Says CEO Sergei Sergienko, \u201cChronoBank is an open source project, one where the best products are always created in collaboration. We\u2019re hoping to get people excited enough about it so that they begin thinking about this new model for their own projects and industries.\u201d\nSergienko says the goal is to curate short-term employment opportunities that appeal to the masses, allowing people to pick and choose when and where they want to work. \u201cWe wish to make short-term work employment more attractive than long-term. Time as a work resource is scarce enough to be valuable, yet abundant enough to be accessible to anyone, especially in the countries and places where nothing else of value exists.\u201d\nHis ultimate vision is to have a stable token developed on Ethereum and start testing and developing a Minimum Value Product (MVP) for LaborX.\n\u201cWe want to see \u00a0ChronoBank's disruptive potential realized and recognized. We would also like to see a greater connection between cryptocurrency and real world, one where the government and legal lines of communication are open and all interested stakeholders are integrated into our system.

In October, the Blockchain Education Network crowdsourced a blockchain syllabus, called Blockchain Education Month, to encourage students to deepen their understanding of the blockchain.\nNow throughout the month of November, BEN hosts its inaugural accelerator called the Blockchain Gauntlet, which includes an aggregation of local 24- and 48-hour hackathons. Any applications built during November can be entered into the Gauntlet, whether or not their team won their local hackathon. The added advantages of participating in the Gauntlet are that teams have extra time to test and refine their demo, and they can receive expert mentorship from the panel of Gauntlet judges and industry experts who can help take their project to the next level.\nThe Gauntlet will be judged by a panel of industry experts and venture capitalists according to criteria of market readiness, technical difficulty, branding and website presentation, originality of idea and usefulness. The lineup of judges and prizes for the Blockchain Gauntlet will be announced soon\nDean Masley, the executive director of the Blockchain Education Network, explained to Bitcoin Magazine his vision for the Blockchain Gauntlet. \u201cWe started the fall initiative to inspire and empower student leaders and active Blockchain communities to extend their outreach to their peers,\u201d said Masley. \u201cWe think blockchain is best done locally, which is why we designed the three-step, three-month plan to intrigue, educate and engage new students to participate in this ecosystem. Stay tuned throughout November to see ambitious blockchain enthusiasts make stabs at what they think the future can look like.\u201d Already leaders in New York, San Francisco, Toronto, and Chicago have begun to plan their local hackathons.\nThe Toronto hackathon is called RegHackTO and is being organized by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), with support from MLG Blockchain Consulting, from November 25-27. The goal of the event is for the Toronto community to develop software to improve regulation. RegHackTO is being judged by industry experts including Maureen Jensen, the Chair and Chief Executive Officer of the OSC, and Joseph Lubin, CEO of ConsenSys.\nThe Toronto hackathon follows the regulator\u2019s establishment of the OSC LaunchPad, the first team dedicated by a securities regulator in Canada to provide direct support to eligible fintech businesses for the navigation of regulatory requirements. \u201cRegHackTO is a great example of the flexible and modern approach to regulation that OSC LaunchPad is ushering in. It\u2019s also an exciting opportunity to bring Canadian innovators together to collaborate on possible solutions to shared challenges in the regulatory environment,\u201d said Jensen. \u00a0\nDev Bharel, the regional leader in Chicago, is hosting the inaugural Chicago Blockchain Developers Conference (CBDC), in collaboration with the Chicago Bitcoin Center, to bring developers of all skill levels together and expose them to the blockchain. CBDC includes workshops with mentors from the community before the hackathon begins on November 12-14. The goal listed on the website is \u201cto bring new developers into the blockchain space and connect them with a community and opportunities\u201d.\n.The Blockchain Education Network is providing APIs and resources to help teams develop their blockchain applications.

The company\u2019s robust iOS app and soon-to-be-released Android app are both built entirely off of the Unocoin API.\nStarted in 2013, Unocoin is a Bangalore-based technology startup that\u2019s widely recognized as India\u2019s first entrant into the Bitcoin industry. The company operates India's largest BTC-INR trading platform, which is designed to empower Indians to buy, sell, store, use and accept bitcoin. Unocoin is also known for its new Merchant Gateway, a means for businesses, traders, e-commerce shops, NGOs and freelancers to utilize Bitcoin as a payment mechanism for their products and services.\nThe company now has more than 30 employees on staff, and each month Unocoin processes bitcoin transactions worth more than 200 million INR ($2.95 million USD) for its 100,000 plus customers.\nCompany Co-Founder and CEO, Sathvik Vishwanath describes the API as an \u201con-ramp for firms looking for a simple way to gain entry into one of the world\u2019s fastest growing and largest potential markets.\u201d He says that the Unocoin team worked nonstop prior to and during their Pre-Series A funding round to develop the most reliable, full featured API possible \u2014 one that is incredibly easy to adopt.\nUnocoin hopes to capitalize on India\u2019s meteoric growth rate, generally considered by many economists to be the fastest in the world. As blockchain and Bitcoin adoption mirrors this climb, new financial platforms are needed to process secure transactions. Unocoin\u2019s API will allow companies seeking to plug in anywhere in the world to gain access to India\u2019s flourishing bitcoin market and remittance industry, estimated at around $100 billion.\nPaycase, a Canadian-based, mobile-first remittance application, and Blockstream\u2019s Liquid network are among the first to integrate Unocoin\u2019s API to deliver fast and low cost money transfers from Canada to India.\n\u201cIndia represents a massive growth opportunity for Bitcoin, and Unocoin is on the cutting edge of Bitcoin and blockchain technology,\u201d said Dr. Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to be working with Unocoin on Liquid and believe the company has the potential to bring Bitcoin to millions of new users based on their technology vision and business execution.\u201d\nIn an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Vishwanath added that while Bitcoin technology has become a revolutionary opportunity for many individuals, businesses and economies, India still lacked a comprehensive platform to buy and sell bitcoins.\n\u201cWe believe that we\u2019re at the dawn of a new evolution where money itself is being reinvented. Building the Unocoin platform brings us one step closer to putting bitcoin in the hands of billions. We are confident that this will further alter the landscape allowing for greater remittance and e-commerce adoption in India.\u201d\nAccording to Vishwanath, Unocoin\u2019s recent momentum mirrors the current environment for Bitcoin and blockchain innovation in India, which he says is still in a growth stage. \u201cIndia has the largest gold, inward remittance and IT markets in the world, all of which make it a perfect home for Bitcoin and blockchain technology. We love seeing so many of the smartest cryptographers, mathematicians and computer scientists from all over the world working together to scale. These are exciting times for sure.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 15}

This is less than a year after its June 2016 launch of the open standard Blockcerts toolset, which it built in collaboration with MIT Media Lab. The partnership came about as a result of the company\u2019s work on admissions systems for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\nPhilipp Schmidt, Director of Learning Innovation for MIT Media Lab, summarized the history of Blockcerts and its team of collaborators, in his October 24 column on Medium.\nLearning Machine is a 10-year-old software company serving post-secondary education providers, students and employers with solutions for enrollment management, portfolio review and applicant tracking.\nIts forthcoming product, Learning Machine Certificates, is a commercial offering that serves as a virtual notary. The mobile app enables individuals to hold the certificates they need to document employment, membership, formal education or other learning, without having to request trusted documentation each time from the respective organizations.\nSince its inception, the company has served more than 700 education clients and much of its revenue currently is generated via its SlideRoom offering, which streamlines institutional processes, such as application, references and portfolio review, and payments.\nDuring the October EDUCAUSE conference in Anaheim, California, MIT Media Lab and Learning Machine representatives presented Blockcerts. The session description promised insight into \"a new infrastructure of trust for the 21st century [that will] add veracity to academic claims such as badges, alternative credentials, diplomas, and eventually transcripts.\" \u00a0\nLearning Machine CEO Chris Jagers is majority owner and is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He cofounded the company with Dan Hughes, its COO, and Ted Wehner, CTO and VP of Engineering.\nIn an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Jagers said he has been surprised by the strong positive response to the use of blockchain-enabled resources among university registrars and other campus officials, both at the conference and elsewhere.\nHe said acceptance and enthusiasm are growing because \"the pain has gotten really big,\" and many education officials strongly believe \"students should own their own records.\"\nHe acknowledged there are inevitable and now routine reservations arising out of \"fear, uncertainty and doubt\" (FUD) \u2014 usually regarding security. But, administrators are \"approaching it in a deeply optimistic way.\"\nJagers noted that some organizations are still proceeding with in-house exploration, even considering building entire private blockchain ecosystems, complete with mining operations.\n\"I see a lot of money being wasted on experiments,\" which he said he believes Blockcerts and commercial services will help minimize, enabling clients to quickly create and issue certificates that can be shared via mobile applications.\nLearning Machine's commercial offering will be available in both enterprise form, which can be used within employer CRM or HR systems; or, in the form of essentially non-customizable software-as-a-service (SaaS) form. Its open standard toolkit includes the Open Badges specification for creation and digital display of symbolic devices that include descriptions of skills attained or other achievements, with links to the organization awarding each badge.\nJagers believes the impact will reach beyond education: \"I believe credentialing is going to be a 'killer app' [that leverages blockchain] because it perfectly matches what the blockchain does,\" and can be applied to serve a wide range of services within and beyond edtech.\nJagers said while he immediately recognizes no direct competitors for his company's Learning Machine Certificates, the availability of Blockcerts should increase the likelihood of new entrants with solutions that might be \"adjacent, very similar or overlapping in some ways.\"\nHe said he welcomes new entrants. First, because he believes \"the whole marketplace will rise together with adoption.\"\nSecond, he said, Learning Machine already has a queue of potential clients \u2014 including U.S. institutions and governments of some nation-states seeking to improve their education infrastructure \u2014 who want to trial the company's forthcoming commercial offering, which he believes will be a convincing alternative to in-house development for many.\nJagers said he does not view entrants built on private blockchains as directly competitive, though he believes they \"muddy the waters\" in terms of the market's understanding of the power of decentralization through leveraging the public Bitcoin blockchain.\nMoreover, he said he suspects many startups that opt away from the bitcoin blockchain may be thinking short-term, rather than making a \"permanent artifact\" that could last hundreds of years.\nHe added, \u201cI don't really get excited about applications of the blockchain unless they really help individuals become self-governing and have less dependence on institutions or vendors... I always ask myself, \u201cIs a vendor or institution creating a dependency on themselves, or are they empowering the individual?\u201d\u201d\nThe Competition\nJagers emphasized that, for the moment, the greatest competitor to Learning Machine's blockchain-based certificate offerings are the \"thousands\" of credentialing services worldwide that still operate within legacy models.\nNew York City-based Credly describes its company as a digital badges and credentials service provider. In June, Credly announced that Toronto-based Destiny Solutions, which supports non-traditional post-secondary institutions' recruitment and engagement with students, would integrate the Credly offering.\nDigimaat, a blockchain-based, credential-validation startup based in Toronto, is led by founder Youssouf Traore, who is also a business process analyst with Laurentian Bank.\nTraore said in an interview that his solution recently exited beta and he aims to offer it initially to institutions in developing nations that are \u2014 like institutions globally \u2014 trying new ways to combat credential fraud.\nDigimaat, Traore explained, leverages the Tierion blockchain-data platform to generate credentialing receipts on the Bitcoin blockchain. He said his sole proprietorship was registered in May.\nTraore also said legacy incumbents currently hold much of the market, citing as examples Ontario-based AuraData Inc., and U.S.-based nonprofit, National Student Clearinghouse.\nAccording the Clearinghouse's website, the company was founded in 1993 and has strategic partners including Ellucian, a software and services provider. Both Ellucian and the Clearinghouse are headquartered in Northern Virginia.\nFocus Remains on Growth\nJagers asserted that Learning Machine\u2019s founders remain strongly focused on sales growth rather than concentrating on an exit strategy, but they do have conversations with potential investors and acquirers who approach the company.\nJagers said the company is \"very profitable\" and it's keeping all options on the table for accelerating growth, whether by raising outside capital, allying with a strategic partner or eventually exiting via sale.\nAsked whether he views an IPO as a valid option, Jagers replied, \"Whenever there's a new market, there's often a winner-take-all situation \u2014 like AirBnB and Uber \u2014 and we do intend to be the inevitable winner\" in blockchain credentialing. He said he expects to see a bevy of IPOs in the overall blockchain sector.\nHe added that, at this time, \"my preference would be West Coast venture capital from a firm that has invested in Bitcoin before,\" and which maintains a portfolio of potentially synergistic partners for Learning Machine.", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 11}

This partnership will make our wallet infinitely more user friendly and, ultimately, more accessible for the mass market.\u201d\nThe Blockchain development team plans to test the Coinify integration with a small group of invite only participants in the U.K. Upon the completion of its successful beta testing, Blockchain aims to expand its services across Europe and ultimately around the world.\nExecutives of Coinify and Blockchain expect that the partnership will serve both banked and unbanked populations globally, by allowing bitcoin wallet funding via credit and debit cards as well as bank accounts.\nWith the emergence of prepaid debit cards that are popular amongst unbanked users who have struggled to obtain formal bank accounts, the Coinify-Blockchain user interface will enable these marginalized users to purchase bitcoin without being restricted by KYC/AML regulations and strict exchange trading limits.\nSmith described the deal as a \u201cgiant step forward in making bitcoin, still a nascent currency, a more compelling and efficient financial solution for new users,\u201d reassuring users that the platform will provide a safe and cost effective method for bitcoin trading while maintaining its high security measures.\nCoinify Co-Founder and CEO Mark H\u00f8jgaard also noted the importance of accelerating mainstream adoption of Bitcoin, emphasizing the potential impact the deal could have on millions of existing and new users.\n\u201cCoinify shares in Blockchain\u2019s mission to accelerate the adoption of digital currencies by making them more easily accessible. With Blockchain\u2019s dominant position in the cryptocurrency wallet market, I believe this will be a real game changer,\u201d said H\u00f8jgaard.\nOver the past few years, KYC/AML regulations for bitcoin trading platforms and exchanges have made bitcoin funding burdensome for many users.\nSome exchanges, including Philippines-based Coins.ph, which recently secured $5 million from former Google CEO Eric Schmidt\u2019s investment company, require users to hand in various documents and perform identity verifications, such as selfie verification and face-to-face Skype calls.\nWhen asked about their AML/KYC requirements, the Coins.ph customer service team stated: \"Unfortunately, this is the requirement coming from the BSP (BSP Circular No 706).

Then comes the learning phase, in which engineers, product managers and others acquire the needed skill and confidence to move projects forward.\nPain and Trust\nPwC's McNamara said, \"I've never quite seen what I've seen happening since I've locked onto blockchain,\" which she described as an \"astonishing and new\" technology. Adoption is coming on a \u201cgrand scale,\u201d she said.\nShe explained that due to the Great Recession (2007-2009) and ensuing capital requirements and other strictures, bank stocks are trading at a 1X book value, versus 2X book pre-recession.\n\"Banks have almost missed out on an entire business cycle of innovation,\" because of such pressures, she said.\nThe resulting pain, particularly the need to improve banks' return on equity, has prompted the search for ways to reduce inefficiencies, while improving productivity and innovation, she said.\nEvaluation of DLT options must include the classic \"4 Ps\": proof of concept, prototype, pilot and production applications, she continued. Other focal points include security, scalability, network capacity and the needs of each asset class. Ultimately, the projected return on DLT investment must also be assayed.\nPwC is working on DLT proof of concept (POCs) and validation engagements in healthcare, industrial supply chain and internet of things (IoT), as well as financial services, said McNamara.\nThe Good, the Bad \u00a0\nCornell's Prof. Sirer also made clear he's no fencesitter when it comes to discussions of digital currencies, DLT and new ideas like Digital Autonomous Corporations (DAC), the latter an automated organization run by rules encoded in smart contracts.\nSirer said unequivocally that the introduction of Bitcoin and blockchain, including the consensus system introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, represent \"an amazing breakthrough.\" And smart contracts, he said, have \"amazing implications.\"\nSirer said he is not oblivious to risks that may come with expansion of blockchain\u2019s spread.\nDeterrents to blockchain could include scams, software developers resistant to change, and companies and institutions slowed by inertia, among other possibilities. Meanwhile, blockchain itself still needs work. Sirer pointed out that the performance of Bitcoin is not yet what it needs to be. He said Bitcoin\u2019s transaction processing speed is a minute fraction of the speed of large incumbent exchanges.\nInvestment pouring into DLT startups will doubtless spur new offerings, he said.\n\"I also suspect,\" said Sirer, \"there will be many, many, many absolutely horrible systems\" and some \"disasters\" that will be widely reported. He added, investors \"will be amply rewarded\" for their successes.\nLeadership\nPanelist Chris Church of DAH noted that the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), is far along in considering the creation of a blockchain replacement for its entire clearing and settlement system, with full production likely to proceed next year.\nChurch said the latest ASX tech push sprang from taking a fresh look in 2015 at how to become more competitive with large peer exchanges, while reducing costs for the ASX and its member firms.\nChurch warned his audience against complacency, given that he views blockchain as advancing in many quarters. \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled,\u201d he said.\nBoth Sirer and Church urged their audience to reach out to colleagues in other organizations that are already deep into blockchain.\nSirer said interest in blockchain is high in many academic centers, pointing to the Center for Cryptocurrencies at his Cornell University, of which he is Co-Director, and related initiatives at Massachusetts Institute for Technology (MIT).\nChurch singled out the nonprofit Linux Foundation's open source Hyperledger project as an important source of expertise, as well as counterparts in Britain, Canada, Australia, Singapore and other nations, as well as in the SEC.\nAlluding to industry fear of disintermediation and loss of jobs in the financial services sector, Church said he doesn't see traditional bricks-and-mortar banks, custodians and others being generally disintermediated, unless individual players fail to transition to advancing technologies.\nHe added that \u201cpeople who roll-up their sleeves and really get involved\u201d in DLT transformation will not only drive down their costs \u2014 they will also be reap rewards when the focus shifts from improving efficiency toward generating new revenues.\nDTCC's Wetjen said his organization has focused on reducing process costs since financial reforms in 2009 brought capital requirements that shrank global Clearing and Depository Services (CDS) volumes, resulting in more pressure for innovation.\nIn 2015, DTCC subsidiaries processed securities transactions valued at more than $1.5 quadrillion, and it provides custody and asset deposit services for securities issues from more than 130 countries and territories valued at $45.4 trillion, according to its website.\nCiting DTCC\u2019s exploration of DLT, Wetjen referred to his company\u2019s ongoing proof-of-concept (POC) effort with Axoni and others, involving testing the use of DLT for credit default swaps (CDS). A DTCC decision on whether to proceed with implementation for that purpose is pending and could translate into \u201cre-platforming\u201d its Trade Information Warehouse (TIW) for derivatives transactions.\nAdditionally, Bitcoin Magazine reported in March that DTCC and Digital Asset Holdings would collaborate on POC development for a blockchain solution for the $2.6 trillion market associated with U.S. Treasury, Agency and Agency Mortgage-Backed repurchase agreement (repo) transactions. That work is underway, a DTCC spokesperson said today.\nAs reported in January, DTCC participated in a $52 million capital raise by Digital Asset Holdings.

Starting tonight, miners can signal support for the proposed centerpiece of\u00a0Bitcoin Core\u2019s scalability\u00a0roadmap. The soft fork will activate if 95 percent of hash power agrees.\nBut Chinese mining pool\u00a0ViaBTC, currently representing some\u00a08 percent of hash power on the Bitcoin network, has\u00a0indicated it will not support SegWit activation. Instead, the mining pool\u00a0favors a hard fork to remove the one megabyte block size limit, as proposed by Bitcoin Core fork\u00a0Bitcoin Unlimited.\nTo learn more about ViaBTC\u2019s motivation, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to CEO Haipo Yang.\nHaipo, you\u2019ve made it clear you want a hard fork to increase the block size limit. Why do you consider this necessary?\nThe past seven-year history of Bitcoin has proven that on-chain transactions are successful and needed by users. I think a hard fork to increase the block size limit is the only way for Bitcoin to develop moving forward, and the only way to preserve the bitcoin mining business model. I support a hard fork to stop Bitcoin from marching towards extinction.\nSince blocks first started filling up about a year ago, the bitcoin price has doubled. How does this indicate \u201ca march towards extinction\u201d?\nWhat influences short-term fluctuations in the bitcoin price comes from speculators rather than from fundamentals like transaction throughput. Bitcoin was valued over $1000 at one point. A rebound to $700 doesn\u2019t seem all that unusual.\nAcademic analysis\u00a0suggests\u00a0that Bitcoin needs a block size limit to guarantee miner income in the long-term. Wouldn\u2019t you rather find out how much users will pay for transactions before worrying about Bitcoin failing?\nI think by the time we find out, it will be too late. Bitcoin offers no benefits over most altcoins other than a first-mover advantage and security. And Bitcoin can lose both these advantages. If there\u2019s not enough capacity, people will use Litecoin instead \u2014 or Ethereum or Zcash, or another altcoin, and Bitcoin will be done for.\nDo you see increased transaction throughput in the short-term as the only road to success? For example, consider the \u201cdigital gold\u201d value proposition, which doesn\u2019t require as many cheap, on-chain transactions.\nIs Bitcoin a currency or a commodity? In my view, this is a bit like the relationship between water and a boat. If bitcoin does not have widespread acceptance as a currency, then its value as a commodity is an illusion. Limiting Bitcoin\u2019s capacity is therefore a ridiculous strategy. It\u2019s as if Facebook would have continued to only let users with a .edu email address register. If they had done that, there wouldn\u2019t be a Facebook today.\nIn your analogy, Facebook could just rent another server in order to meet capacity. \u00a0Increasing the block size presents a burden to each Bitcoin node. If you want to keep Bitcoin decentralized, it\u2019s not as easy to scale.\nThe large majority of Bitcoin users have no need to run their own nodes. By design, Bitcoin allows users to make choices when it comes to speed, convenience and trust. They can use a light wallet. The trade off for that convenience is that they give up a very small amount of trust.\nThey give up this trust to miners. Don\u2019t you think that having to trust third parties \u2014 in this case, miners \u2014 is against a principal goal of Bitcoin?\nBased on the current quality of hardware, I don\u2019t think increasing the block size up to four megabytes will be a problem for the foreseeable future. Users would still be able to run full nodes if they want to.\nBut surely you don\u2019t think that four megabytes will be enough to meet any and all eventual demand?\nWe don\u2019t know how many potential Bitcoin use cases there are, and what scenarios they will be applied to. Perhaps we\u2019ll find that four \u2014 or maybe eight \u2014 megabytes actually is enough. What we do know is that one megabyte blocks can\u2019t meet present users\u2019 demand \u2014 and Bitcoin must scale.\nMany use cases can also be realized through added layers. Some of these layers already exist, like ChangeTip or Coinbase\u2019s off-chain transactions. And trustless layers like the lightning network are in production as well.\nI don't deny that the lightning network and other second layer technologies have benefits. And plenty of off-chain transactions are indeed already happening, for example in exchanges. But many Bitcoin transactions also need to be made on-chain, where they can be traced. This is what second tier technologies cannot achieve.\nAdditionally, opening a lightning payment channel requires users to lock-up funds, which is an extra barrier to entry. If that\u2019s the only affordable option, some users will choose to leave Bitcoin and go elsewhere. On-chain transactions are a proven concept \u2014 technologies like the lightning network are not.\nThe lightning network can prove itself once Segregated Witness is activated. And as a bonus, Segregated Witness almost doubles the effective block size. Yet, you intend to block its activation. Why?\nSegregated Witness can be implemented more simply and cleaner via a hard fork, but Bitcoin Core has opted for a more complex soft fork. This indicates they don\u2019t want a hard fork at all, and don\u2019t want to increase the block size limit either. If the soft fork is adopted, I think a hard fork will be off the table. My goal is not really to block Segregated Witness in and of itself, but to work towards a Bitcoin version I think is better.\nIn your opinion, what must this hard fork look like, exactly?\nI have proposed to transition to Bitcoin Unlimited because Bitcoin Unlimited removes the hard-coded restriction on the protocol layer completely. Once the one megabyte hard limit restriction is removed, the block size can adjust dynamically in line with the needs of users and technological progress.\nIn this scenario, the block size limit would effectively be controlled by a handful of mining pools representing a majority of hash power which does not sound very decentralized.\nYou cannot say bitcoin mining is centralized just because most miners are located in China. There are more than 20 mining pools, where the biggest pool represents no more than 20 percent of hash power on the network. There are thousands of miners, and anyone is free to start mining. Besides that, Bitcoin is a proof-of-work system. Regular users can share their opinions to try to influence the miners, but ultimately the decision is made by the miners. And of course users want bigger blocks. Of course they want to be able to send more transactions, for a lower fee. Keep in mind that miners have invested millions of dollars in Bitcoin. They won't do anything against the users\u2019 interest.\nImagine if \u201cDr. Evil\u201d invests $100 billion in mining equipment next year. Or if the Chinese government decides to regulate Bitcoin on a protocol level. If a majority of miners can increase the block size limit to the point where users can\u2019t run full nodes, won\u2019t this hugely centralize \u2014 and perhaps destabilize \u2014 the system?\nWell yes, there is always the risk of 51% attacks. The security of Bitcoin requires that more than half of all miners are honest. The confidence people have in Bitcoin is based on this assumption. And Bitcoin will become safer when more investment is made in Bitcoin mining.\nThe confidence people have in Bitcoin also lies in the fact that miners cannot arbitrarily change any protocol rule. If miners hard fork to a new protocol without support from users, they would effectively fork themselves of the network.\nIf miners hard fork to a new protocol, why would users stay on a chain with no hash power? A network where transactions don\u2019t confirm is useless.\nPerhaps users aren\u2019t interested in a Bitcoin where miners control the block size limit. Perhaps they don\u2019t support a contentious hard fork, etc. Users left behind on the original network may even decide to change the proof-of-work algorithm to \u201cfire\u201d the existing set of miners.\nI'm not at all worried about Bitcoin Core changing the proof-of-work algorithm. Such a big change in the consensus mechanism would not be accepted by the majority of the community, and as a result there would simply be one more altcoin.\nBoth ends of the fork will probably consider each others\u2019 chain to be the altcoin...\nIn that case we\u2019ll let the market choose which side is Bitcoin.\nIn that case, why not have ViaBTC hard fork right now and let the market decide straight away?\nI prefer not to see a currency split, and I don\u2019t think it will happen if we get 75 percent of all hash power on board. But Bitcoin Unlimited miners currently only control about 10 percent of hash power on the network. If we\u2019d hard fork now, we probably wouldn\u2019t get enough user acknowledgement and support \u2014 and meanwhile we\u2019d undertake a tremendous opportunity loss. As a rational businessman, I won\u2019t do that.\nLet\u2019s say your hard fork succeeds. Several Bitcoin Core developers have already indicated they have no interest in joining this new network. Who will maintain and develop this Bitcoin?\nI think if Bitcoin Unlimited becomes the main chain, a rather high ratio of developers will turn to contribute. The Bitcoin code is much less complicated than that of Linux or other open source software, so in this world there are plenty of people with the ability to maintain Bitcoin.\nWhere are all these people, and why aren\u2019t they maintaining Bitcoin right now?\nI could do it if I wanted to.\nWhy don\u2019t you?\nNobody is paying me to do it. And I can earn more by doing other things.\nCouldn\u2019t it be argued, though, that insofar as Bitcoin Core developers are paid at all, they could probably be earning more by doing other things as well?\nThat is wrong. They should be paid. I personally already pay two Bitcoin XT developers, and if a fork happens, I\u2019m sure there are many more people that can fund development. Roger Ver, Jihan Wu\u2026 And there will be more mature companies in the Bitcoin ecosystem, which all have momentum to support and cultivate more Bitcoin developers too.\nDo you think that the Bitcoin Core development team should be fired?\nI believe that the Bitcoin Core developers currently have too much power; there's no system of checks and balances for them. They can decide to make massive changes to Bitcoin based on their own personal preferences, and then force those changes on to the users.\nNeither users nor miners are forced to run Bitcoin Core. You know that, since you are, in fact, not running Bitcoin Core. Developers make a proposal; the community decides whether or not to accept it.\nThere\u2019s not enough competing implementations to take that position seriously. We already had some competition, but none of these alternative clients posed a threat to Bitcoin Core. A hard fork to Bitcoin Unlimited may change the developer environment. That is what we need. No one should be able to control Bitcoin.\nIs that, perhaps, what this is really about? Control?\nI do think the centralization of Bitcoin development is an even bigger issue than the block size limit or Segregated Witness. Bitcoin Core has a privileged position as the \u201creference client.\u201d And only a few people have the rights to merge code in it.\nBitcoin Core is a relatively loosely-knit group of volunteer developers. They choose to cooperate because they agree that\u2019s a more effective way of getting things done. Besides, anyone can fork their code. What alternative do you propose?\nI have some thoughts about that, but haven\u2019t worked out all of the details. I think Bitcoin Core\u2019s code should not define Bitcoin. Like many other successful open source projects, there should be a specification document to define Bitcoin. This will help alternative implementations become compatible with Bitcoin Core, meaning they can effectively compete \u2014 rather than just follow.\nI think everyone would agree a specification document would be welcome. But in the end, Bitcoin is the code people run on their computers, is it not?\nI believe the consensus should not be code, it should be English. It should be understandable for most Bitcoin users and companies. This way more people can have a voice, an impact.Speaking of control, who controls the hash power on ViaBTC? Some say it\u2019s Bitmain.\nOur pool system is highly available, stable and efficient. We have not produced a single orphan block, and we give all mining fees to miners. This is what's attracting hundreds of miners to our pool, big and small. The idea that Bitmain controls the hash power on ViaBTC is totally ridiculous.", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 17}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nFor many, Bitmain\u2019s recent\u00a0announcement of the\u00a0realization of a major data center in northwestern China served as a reminder of the level of mining centralization in Bitcoin. Although the Beijing-based company will not own the entire complex, and the whole facility will not necessarily be dedicated to bitcoin mining, in theory over half of all hash power securing the Bitcoin network could be concentrated in a single data center.\nFor some, this is reason for concern. If bitcoin mining is dominated by one or even several data centers, these could represent a single point of failure \u2014 something Bitcoin was specifically designed to avoid.\nMuch of Bitcoin\u2019s future may therefore depend on a reversal of the trend toward further centralization. And there is reason to believe the trend may indeed reverse.\nCentralization Concerns\nIn 2009, the first year of Bitcoin\u2019s existence, there was little difference between running a node and mining. The typical Bitcoin-Qt wallet allowed regular users to invest spare CPU power to try and earn some coins.\nBy the end of that year it was first suggested that GPUs \u2014 mining with video cards \u2014 could be more effective. In response, Bitcoin\u2019s inventor asked users to refrain from doing so \u2014 at least for the time being.\n\u201cIf everyone bought faster machines, they wouldn't get more coins than before,\u201d Satoshi Nakamoto wrote on\u00a0Bitcointalk. \u201cWe should have a gentleman's agreement to postpone the GPU arms race as long as we can for the good of the network. It's much easier to get new users up to speed if they don't have to worry about GPU drivers and compatibility.\u201d\nRegardless, the shift towards GPUs occurred throughout 2010. And with it, bitcoin mining increasingly shifted from regular users to dedicated specialists. Setting up mining rigs in basements and attics, a lot of these specialists started out as hobbyists. Over time, however, the competitive nature of mining ensured only the most efficient of them remained profitable.\nThe introduction early in 2013 of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) was a first real step towards the professionalization of mining. From 2013 onward, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips really changed the game. The specialized hardware, which required a significant investment to produce, transformed the mining ecosystem into an industry.\nThis is when data centers became an attractive option. It makes sense to have few specialists oversee large mining farms for maintenance; and it helps if the facility is well-suited for mining \u2014 for example, if it is dust-free.\nA more important factor in favor of data centers was the exceptional pace of improvement of ASIC chips. The lifespan of mining hardware can be as short as several months, when it gets made obsolete by a newer generation. This means that mining equipment should ideally be put to work in the near vicinity of the chip production factory.\nAs Andreas Antonopoulos explained at the d10e conference in San Francisco last summer:\n\u201cIf you try to put [an ASIC miner] on a ship [from China] and take it across water, it leaves your shores as fantastic mining equipment and arrives in California as scrap metal three months later.\u201d\nBut one factor in favor of data centers probably trumps all others. Since proof of work in essence amounts to burning energy, low cost electricity is vital. Unsurprisingly, bitcoin mining is often concentrated near power plants with excess energy production, in areas where power is subsidized by governments, or where miners are able to strike a good deal with local energy producers.\nBack in 2014, R3CEV\u2019s Director of Market Research, Tim Swanson, wrote in Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201c[M]iners in China \u2026 have found the right people to partner with (at least for the moment). One such team is working within the current system and has access to a double digit megawatt power facility, which when coupled together with 3rd party chips, the production costs of which are less than $2.00 / gigahash.\u201d\nMining at Home\nBut the trend toward centralization may reverse.\nSpeaking at the Web Summit 2014 in Dublin, former Bitcoin Core lead developer Gavin Andresen\u00a0argued:\n\"Centralization of mining is going to go in waves. Now you see economies of scale for companies that create huge mining farms where electricity is inexpensive. Once those [ASIC] chips become commodities and inexpensive, you'll see it decentralize again.\"\nIndeed, the rapid technical improvement of ASIC chips has been slowing down. Last year, 21 Inc. CEO Balaji Srinivasan wrote on his\u00a0company website:\n\u201cNow that mining chips are typically manufactured at the latest process nodes, further improvements in mining chips will not come fast and furious as they did over the March 2013 \u2013 October 2014 time period. Instead they will be gated by the 18-24 month wait of Moore's law \u2014 just like CPUs.\u201d\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, therefore, Bitmain recently started selling the Antminer R4, which makes less noise than typical miners and is specifically designed for in-home use. And BitFury ships the BlockBox, a shipping container-sized mobile data center.\nAnd home mining does have some cost advantages over data centers as well. Perhaps most obviously: storage is free. And while data centers are indeed still at an advantage when it comes to energy-costs, this may very well change in the future.\nBlockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra explained in a\u00a0paper published last year:\n\u201cChina\u2019s increasing wealth is causing their regulatory and environmental costs to come in line with Western nations; there will also be pressure against this sort of monopolistic behaviour,\u201d Poelstra wrote. \u201cHighly centralized power production is inefficient because of line losses. As technology, such as solar power, matures, it will be possible to produce power more locally with lower startup costs and less dependence on geopolitical factors.\u201d\nOne other big benefit home miners have over professionals: they don\u2019t necessarily need to turn a profit. Some hobbyists or idealists may want to support the network, simply because they enjoy it at break-even rates or at a small cost.\n21 Inc.\u2019s Srinivasan, furthermore, thinks regular users will be willing to \u201cswap\u201d electricity to get small amounts of bitcoin, as this is potentially useful for micropayments.\nSrinivasan\u00a0explained on his company website:\n\u201c[W]e may be able to distribute mining chips with CPUs, as a new kind of co-processor \u2014 much like GPUs or networking cards added new functionality to complement CPUs ... We think that the next step after pooled data center mining is massively distributed and decentralized mining, such that millions of mining chips worldwide each generate a small stream of bitcoin.\u201d\nSomewhat similarly, Bitmain recently introduced the\u00a0AntRouter R1. This router serves as a typical wireless networking device, but with an embedded mining chip. Mining with the device is explained as entering a \u201cbitcoin lottery\u201d held once about every ten minutes: lucky winners can hit a jackpot of at least 12.5 bitcoins. While entering this lottery may not be profitable on average \u2014 lotteries never are \u2014 it can still be fun to participate.\nHeat Generation\nBut the most important factor in favor of home mining over data centers is probably heat.\nAs Poelstra explained in his paper, \u201c[I]t is easier for two physically-separated actors to dissipate heat than for just one. Therefore, in the thermodynamic limit we have a physical incentive for decentralization.\u201d\nCrammed in rows and full racks in data centers, heat generated by ASIC miners requires extensive cooling to remain functional. Which, in turn, requires additional electricity.\nAt home, on the other hand, the heat generated by miners can actually be beneficial. Since all power consumed by these machines ends up as heat, they are fine substitutes for electric space heaters. Not only would these miners consume the same amount of electricity a space heater would have consumed otherwise, they provide the added benefit of generating an income in bitcoin.\nGavin Andresen suggested the future may even witness bitcoin mining equipment that utilizes the generated heat for household equipment, like electric blankets. And indeed, at least one startup \u2014 hotmine.io \u00a0\u2014 is currently offering water boilers and other household products that mine bitcoin.\nStill, some remain skeptical. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Bitmain\u2019s international marketing manager Nishant Sharma said:\n\u201cThe idea of a space heater-cum-bitcoin miner has been around since 2010, or even before. But we haven't seen this idea being successfully realized in a consumer product yet. This is most likely because it is difficult for such a product to be competitive in either mining or space heating.\u201d\nThanks to Jop Hartog for added information.", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 16}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin\u2019s oldest mining pool,\u00a0Slush Pool, will let its miners vote on the\u00a0Segregated Witness soft fork proposed by\u00a0Bitcoin Core. By passing this choice down to individual miners that connect to the pool (sometimes also referred to as \u201chashers\u201d) Slush Pool hopes to remove itself as a decision maker from the equation.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Slush Pool operator Marek \u201cSlush\u201d Palatinus stated:\n\u201cSatoshi\u2019s idea was not to have a few entities control the network. As a mining pool we shouldn\u2019t rule.\u201d\nSegregated Witness\nMining pools offer Bitcoin miners a solution to combine their hash power, sharing any block rewards they may find. Last year, Slush Pool was the first pool to also offer their hashers a chance to\u00a0indicate preference on a potential block size limit increase hard fork. Whenever a hasher participating in the pool finds a block, that specific block is tagged with the choice of the hasher.\nAs a proposed soft fork per the requirement established by Bitcoin Core, Segregated Witness will require support from 95 percent of all hash power on the network to activate. Continuing its policy to put hashers in control, Slush Pool \u2014 which accounts for\u00a0six percent of all hash power on the Bitcoin network \u2014 will let hashers vote in support of, or against, Segregated Witness activation.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Palatinus explained why he believes Slush Pool should refrain from making decisions on behalf of its hashers:\n\u201cPools are just service providers for miners, which makes mining easier and optimizes costs. I don\u2019t consider it much different from internet service providers, and I think we should adhere to similar principles of net neutrality. At Slush Pool, therefore, our long-term strategy is to remain neutral on potential hard forks and soft forks, and to offer tools for miners to decide for themselves.\u201d\nPalatinus himself does hope the Segregated Witness soft fork will activate. The co-inventor of pooled mining believes that the proposal will offer significant benefits that improve Bitcoin overall, with little downside.\n\u201cWe see Segregated Witness as a fix of many holes left in the Bitcoin protocol, which do need to be fixed,\u201d Palatinus said. \u201cProblems like quadratic scaling during transaction signing, malleability issues, the inability to know the value of an input... Yes, Segregated Witness is a pretty complex solution, but these issues cannot be fixed much [more easlily]. It is also one of the most tested changes in Bitcoin history. There's huge intellectual effort behind the whole concept, and I think it would be really sad if that won't go through because of political games.\u201d\nDespite its intention to remain neutral, Slush Pool did decide to enable Segregated Witness signaling as the default. If hashers don\u2019t change their settings, they will signal support for Segregated Witness \u2014 but they can easily switch that support off.\nBlock Size Debate\nWhile Segregated Witness offers several benefits, one of these has garnered a lot of attention in the context of the block size debate in particular. The proposed soft fork replaces Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit with a block \u201cweight\u201d limit, which offers an effective block size limit increase of about 0.7 to 1.0 megabyte, depending on the types of transactions included in a block.\nSome proponents of a block size limit increase, however, prefer a hard fork to increase the block size limit instead. Perhaps most notably, the relatively new Chinese mining pool\u00a0ViaBTC \u2014 controlling about eight percent of all hash power on the network \u2014 has\u00a0indicated it will\u00a0reject Segregated Witness in favor of a hard fork.\nCriticizing this approach, Palatinus said he does not believe Segregated Witness and a hard fork block size limit increase are mutually exclusive. Apart from Segregated Witness signaling, Slush Pool hashers can still mine blocks indicating support for a block size limit increase hard fork.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see Segregated Witness as a scaling solution primarily \u2014 though it will help a bit,\u201d Palatinus explained. \u201cAnd we believe that all scaling solutions \u2014 including Segregated Witness \u2014 should be adopted, regardless of politics. That\u2019s why we let our miners vote for their preferred hard fork and soft fork at the same time, and give them an option to combine these votes. It\u2019s not an either/or proposition.\u201d\nPalatinus himself has been a long-time proponent of increasing Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit through a hard fork. Though, when asked by Bitcoin Magazine, the pool operator also explained he\u2019s not confident the solution, as proposed by Bitcoin Unlimited and endorsed by ViaBTC, is the way to go at this point.\n\u201cI was in favor of increasing the block size limit because I think Bitcoin is quite anti-fragile, and do not share some of the disaster visions you hear,\u201d Palatinus said. \u201cHowever, what troubles me is that recent efforts to hard fork seem pretty light-handed and without serious research behind them. Proposals like Bitcoin Unlimited\u2019s are adding another degree of freedom to Bitcoin's economic model, and it is unclear how much this changes incentives and the overall balance of the network.\n\u201cSimply put: I don't believe there are simple solutions for complex problems.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 18}

How are tax reporting agencies responding to the large number of digital currencies that now exist worldwide? To what extent is virtual money being used for tax avoidance purposes?\nAll of this has sparked fervent conversations among those being paid in bitcoin, those simply investing in it, and many of the anarcho-capitalist bent who view taxation as theft. And given prevailing issues around tax havens, offshore accounts, encryption and the Panama Paper revelations, many would argue that prevailing tax monitoring systems are prime for disruption.\nIn an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, tax professional\u00a0Daniel Winters, addressed ways to make sense of this increasingly complex U.S. taxation landscape. His boutique firm Global Tax Accountants is one of only a handful worldwide that focuses on the tax ramifications of digital currency and blockchain transactions.\nWinter\u2019s journey to this narrowly defined niche is an interesting one. Hearing about bitcoin\u2019s growing popularity in 2013, he ponied up some money and purchased a tiny amount. He became fascinated with Bitcoin\u2019s trustless, peer-to-peer system of exchanging value that exists completely outside of the control of central banks or government. Over time he began to explore how this movement might align with his work as a tax professional. Later, after reviewing the the guidance issued by the IRS on the taxation of virtual currencies in March of 2014, he elected to pivot his entire accounting practice last year toward the digital currency/blockchain niche \u00a0\nToday, Daniel has over 30 clients that include investors, contractors and businesses that have bitcoin earnings. He has presented on bitcoin and taxes at the Texas Bitcoin Conference and the New York Bitcoin Center, and was interviewed by Bloomberg regarding New Jersey's tax treatment of bitcoin transactions. \u00a0\nIn the following interview, Winters discusses the road ahead, as U.S. tax authorities and users alike seek to better understand tax policy in the rapidly expanding digital currency landscape.\nIs bitcoin considered money for tax purposes? \nPer IRS Notice 2014-21, bitcoin is considered a virtual currency and is thus treated as property for federal tax purposes. \u00a0In other words, the IRS views bitcoin as being similar to stocks and bonds. \u00a0So under federal tax law, if you purchase bitcoin and later sell it, you will have a gain or loss on the transaction.\nBitcoin\u2019s designation as a virtual currency connotes its use as a medium of exchange. \u00a0And the fact that it is traded on the market determines its value. However, as we know, it is not backed by any sovereign government and is not legal tender anywhere. So it functions as a currency, but only in the virtual world and electronically.\nWhere was the definition derived from? \u00a0\nFinCen issued extensive guidance for the defining of digital currency. When the IRS issued their guidance in March 2014, they took the definition of a virtual currency directly from FinCen and then said okay, that is what virtual currency is and how it\u2019s defined for tax purposes. Again the big takeaway from the IRS guidance is that bitcoin for tax purposes is property, not currency.\nBut given bitcoin\u2019s global nature, why isn\u2019t it considered a foreign currency? \nThe IRS does not view bitcoin as a foreign currency for tax purposes. Foreign currency has a different classification, and receives very different tax treatment. \u00a0In other words, bitcoin does not get treated the same way as if you bought some Euros in Germany and then had them converted into U.S. dollars.\nAnd what\u2019s with all of the talk about bitcoin being classified as a commodity? \nThere is a lot of misinformation out there about this. So for the record: bitcoin is also not treated as a commodity for tax purposes. \u00a0This confusion likely has ensued from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that regulates financial derivatives. They have stated that bitcoin is a commodity for purposes of the CFTC. The Commission was created many years ago to regulate financial products, such as futures contracts or derivatives for the price of soybeans, corn or pork bellies. \u00a0A derivative is basically a contract whose value is dependent on the price of something else, such as the price of soybeans. So the CFTC regulates financial derivatives and futures contracts. What they were trying to convey with regards to bitcoin is that it is also essentially a futures contract or derivative, which they are charged with regulating. But this [the CFTC] has nothing to do with taxation.\nSo why was it defined as a futures contract to begin with?\nBasically, a futures contract allows you to purchase the right to buy or sell a commodity or other asset for a set price at a future point in time. These contracts were originally created for farmers, who wanted to guarantee the price of their crops. These days, you can buy a derivatives contract for a vast array of financial assets, including bitcoin. Therefore, when the CFTC issued their notice concerning bitcoin, this just meant that bitcoin derivatives contracts are being regulated by the CFTC. Again, bitcoin is most definitely not a commodity for tax purposes. \u00a0\nSo at the end of the day, is a bitcoin sale viewed in the same way as that of a stock? \nYes. Since Bitcoin sales are treated like stock sales, the resulting gain will be either short-term or long-term and subject to those respective tax rates. Long-term sales, for which bitcoin is held for more than one year, are subject to a 15 percent capital gains tax for most taxpayers. Taxpayers in the top income bracket are subject to a 20 percent capital gains tax, which applies to income above $415,050 for single taxpayers, and $466,950 for married taxpayers filing jointly. \u00a0Short-term sales are those for which bitcoin was held for up to one year and are subject to ordinary income rates of up to 39.6 percent.\nHow is all of this accounted for on a tax return? \nWith respect to bitcoin, there are two things that need to be reported on a tax return: income or revenue and any capital gains on the sale of those assets.\nAnd how are capital gains calculated? \nCapital gain/loss is calculated by subtracting the purchase price, or basis, of the virtual currency from the sale price. The basis of a given amount of virtual currency is the fair market value, in US dollars, on the date of payment or receipt. \u00a0\nWhat that means for the average user is if they purchase $100 of bitcoin today, they own an asset with a cost basis of $100. Now let\u2019s say that a year goes by and bitcoin goes through the moon, doubling in price. So it\u2019s now worth $200. You then sell it and get $200. $200 minus $100 is $100 in capital gains, which must be reported on your tax return.\nBut there are some that say that bitcoin becomes non-taxable if you convert it before it appreciates.\nThat\u2019s incorrect. If you receive $1,000 in bitcoin from, let\u2019s say, a mining contract then you have $1,000 in income. And if it\u2019s a business, it should be viewed as $1,000 of revenue. Bottom line, it\u2019s $1,000 of ordinary income or revenue. But also keep in mind that it is also considered a capital asset, with a cost basis of $1,000. So unless you convert that bitcoin into dollars that day, you\u2019re going to have a gain or a loss on the transaction.\nHow do the tax guidelines apply to bitcoin miners and their earnings? \nThe IRS says that if you are a miner that receives (bitcoin) revenue from a mining business, this equates to the U.S. dollar value of the virtual currency on the day you receive it. So as an example, say you are solo mining and you go a month and a half without getting paid. Then one day you suddenly become lucky and hit a big block with 12 coins. The complete dollar value of those revenues apply on the date you received them.\nHow are taxes viewed for a mining business? \nRevenue reflects the dollar value of the bitcoin the business receives each day. Businesses can, however, reduce their revenues by any expenses they incur, irrespective of whether those expenses are paid in dollars converted from bitcoin or bitcoin itself. In other words, if you purchase a bunch of, say, power supplies for your mining business with bitcoin, your expenses are deductible.\nWhat about bitcoin received in exchange for goods or services? \nIt is treated as ordinary income, the same as normal wages paid in fiat currency.\nWhat about a miner or freelance contractor that receives their pay in bitcoin? \nIRS stated very clearly that contractors who receive bitcoin or other forms of digital currency are subject to the 1099 reporting rule. That means that if you are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident and someone pays you in bitcoin, that company is obligated to provide a 1099 to you, provided that it was at least $600.\nAnd W-2 employees? \nIf someone is a W-2 employee and their employer chooses to pay them in bitcoin, the IRS states that the dollar value of those wages gets added into any other dollars they\u2019ve received during the year and that must be included on their end of the year tax document. \u00a0\nThe IRS just recently released a new guidance report in September. Can you briefly discuss this? \nThe IRS\u2019 recent 31 page guidance report takes a broad look at bitcoin and virtual currency taxation, what the IRS has done so far to address it, and what they need to do in the future. The broad goals of this guidance are as follows: (1) determine if virtual currencies are widely being used as a method to hide income and avoid US taxation; (2) share virtual currency knowledge across the IRS; (3) identify audit techniques that can used to determine if taxpayers using virtual currencies in transactions, especially offshore arrangements, are attempting to conceal income and avoid US taxation.\nIs this part of a larger enforcement effort?\nLet\u2019s just say that the IRS has a team charged with determining whether bitcoin is being used for tax evasion. This knowledge is being shared throughout the IRS and audit techniques are being identified to nail people who are hiding their income. They have given training to over 300 agents, providing a general overview of what virtual currency is and how it works.\nThe IRS is well aware that most people, many people, don\u2019t properly report their bitcoin transactions and they are well aware of the fact that their enforcement mechanisms are not sufficient.\nIn your view how pervasive do you believe the use of bitcoin and other forms of digital currency will become as a tax-avoidance tool globally? \nIt's very difficult to answer that question. \u00a0Our firm doesn\u2019t accept clients that are engaged in tax evasion. Bottom line, trying to use bitcoin to avoid paying taxes is not too smart. Since all bitcoin transactions are publicly available on the blockchain, if someone can associate your identity with a particular bitcoin address, your transactions are right there.\nAny final advice for those who are actively investing and/or being paid in bitcoin? \nKeep good records. This is particularly important given the history of instability among exchanges and the fact that they might go under at any moment. I get asked all the time about how likely it is that the IRS will detect tax avoidance. In my view, it is important to be compliant with the law and avoid any unnecessary complications with the tax authorities. That\u2019s my passion: supporting people in achieving this aim. \u00a0\nNote:\u00a0Daniel Winters holds a Master\u2019s of Taxation and owns an accounting firm specializing in Bitcoin and virtual currencies.

The intent of this funding is to address one of the world\u2019s most urgent problems \u2014 the maintenance of medical records that are secure, readily accessible and reliable.\nPrevailing medical record systems are typically paper-based and stored in hard copy files. This system becomes a problem, particularly in the developing world, when people relocate or if a region becomes politically or economically unstable. Creating an infrastructure for medical records \u00a0that is individual-based and secured via the Factom blockchain addresses both of these issues in a cost effective and pragmatic way, offering real benefits to poorer countries.\nWith advances in this solution, medical providers and clinics will have a greater ability to address disease conditions and manage care in areas often lacking technological resources. By way of example, through the use of a smartphone a medical professional can access the record of a baby born in a remote area to ensure they are receiving correct vaccinations. The same for an HIV-infected person where viral load measurement results need to be identified. The hope is that blockchain technology will save lives as well as money in nations that are currently dealing with some of the world\u2019s most deadly diseases.\nThe broader objectives of the Gates Foundation align well with Factom\u2019s core belief that people and institutions can solve hard problems and change the world for the better when they have a reliable framework to build on.\n\u201cWe for a very long time have been trying to make the world a more honest and transparent place,\" Peter Kirby, CEO and Co-Founder of Factom said to Bitcoin Magazine. \"Our work has led to the creation of some interesting materials on blockchain\u2019s contribution to the records identity space and why that matters.\u201d\nKirby recounted the conversation with a Gates Foundation staff member who reached out to inquire whether Factom\u2019s innovative solutions might work for some of the problems the foundation is trying to solve. \u201cHow can the blockchain be used in a way that allows people to have access to their medical records? How do you deal with places in the world where central databases and central governments are messy? What can be done to keep track of things like vaccine records? These were the type of questions they asked.\u201d\nThe good news, said Kirby, is that the blockchain\u2019s attributes as a giant distributed data resource make these sorts of solutions possible. Describing the medical records realm as \u201cone of the biggest, hairiest record-keeping problems on earth,\u201d Kirby said that the biggest challenge in this quest is in how to deliver a solution that \u201cbalances privacy and transparency.\u201d Another issue is how to make all of this work in environments that have low rates of web connectivity and a population without fancy smartphones.\nKirby is quick to point out that Factom\u2019s engineers have been pondering solutions to these sorts of questions for a very long time. \u201cWe have a pretty good strategy for it, although we are not disclosing all of the details yet. We\u2019d like to build it and get it working before we show it off and talk about it too much.\u201d\nThe system for medical records in the U.S. is saddled with heavy regulatory burdens primarily focused on issues of privacy. There are often many hoops to jump through around Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance and data integrity. Meanwhile, the developing world is also in urgent need of simple solutions in this space.\nThe Gates Foundation specifically has a mandate to create these sorts of opportunities in the very poorest countries in the world, where the amount of money available to spend on essential projects is limited. Similar to the way that a big leap forward is taking place with mobile phones in the developing world, there is an expectation that the same can hold true for the blockchain in terms of record-keeping, identity, and privacy.\n\u201cOur goal with this new partnership is to demonstrate how global identity and record-keeping as a public utility is possible,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cWe hope to show how individuals can manage important, private records like medical records using very simple tools and a lot of backend cryptography. My belief is that the blockchain will be used more and more over time for these aims. If we all follow these core beliefs, we will get to a very, very good place in this world.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 18}

Thus, most people in the technically-oriented Bitcoin community treat the specter of mining centralization as a problem to be solved chiefly by technical means. However, a substantial cause of mining centralization is Chinese government policy, which distorts the digital currency mining market. There are creative arguments that China is violating its international trade obligations. Given the consequences for mining centralization, government subsidy for digital currency mining might be added to the list of banned activities for World Trade Organization members.\nIn international trade, \"dumping\" is a predatory pricing tactic in which manufacturers from one country export a product to another country at a price either below the price charged at home, or below its cost of production. Dumping seeks to kill off competition in the importing country, so firms in the exporting country can raise prices to supranormal levels.\nSomething like dumping is recognizable in the world of bitcoin mining, where the advantages Chinese firms have in chip fabrication link up with access to deeply discounted, government-provided energy to produce an unusually strong mining industry. As a result, China's mining community has a high percentage of the world's hash power, and miners elsewhere, such as KnCMiner in Sweden, have gone bankrupt.\nBitcoin Magazine recently reported that chip maker and miner, Bitmain, is building a major data center complex in the northwest of China to focus on Bitcoin. Its location, Xinjang, is ideal because of its cold, dry climate and \"access to government-supported, low cost wind and solar electricity.\"\nThe World Trade Organization's Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) details what subsidies are subject to challenge by WTO members and on what terms. Cheap, government-supplied energy is a subsidy. According to the terms of the agreement it is: (i) a financial contribution; (ii) by a government or any public body within the territory of a member; (iii) that confers a benefit.\nSubsidies must also be \"specific.\" If a subsidy is widely available, it is presumed not to distort the allocation of resources. But if a government subsidy targets particular companies, sectors of the economy, regions or exports, that subsidy runs afoul of the rules.\nChina's hydropower glut almost certainly didn't originate to bolster a bitcoin mining industry that wasn't conceivable when the dams were built. But Chinese power subsidizes mining all the same, and it doesn't just cause economic dislocation. It undercuts Bitcoin's security. A blockchain system maintained by entities within a single government's jurisdiction is at greater risk of political manipulation and censorship.\nThe SCM delineates two types of subsidies: prohibited and actionable. Subsidies designed to directly affect trade and thus adversely affect other WTO members are prohibited. Actionable subsidies are those that may be shown to cause adverse effects to other WTO members. When goods are at issue, subsidies can be challenged either through multilateral dispute settlement, or through countervailing action. Subsidies for services are subject to \"consultations,\" according to WTO rules. The Trade in Services Agreement now being hammered out in Geneva might be expanded to explicitly bar subsidies for digital currency mining, or data processing generally.\nAs a category buster, bitcoin and other digital currencies can be a poor fit with the traditional rules governing international trade. Anti-dumping law and the SCM apply only to trade in goods. The new bitcoins created with each block are arguably goods, even if they take digital form. The rest of the mining process is best thought of as providing transaction-inclusion services for digital currency users. When new bitcoins are no longer being created, mining will be a pure financial and data processing service.\nBitcoin transactions also don't generally have a \"location.\" This means inclusion of any particular transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain is not easily proven to be a subsidized service to a consumer outside China, and Bitcoin transactions within China are subsidized to the same degree as transactions outside the country. Countervailing measures such as tariffs would be very hard to administer.\nOn the other hand, given the global trade and large proportion of Bitcoin transactions among users outside of China, bitcoins as goods and mining as transaction-inclusion services are clearly being provided to consumers outside China. These are exports, even though the precise place of purchase or location of service may be ambiguous.\nBitcoin's basis in math makes the case for wrongful subsidies much easier. The power consumption bitcoin mining requires and the hash power available to various mining groups is readily calculable, so it's quite easy to measure the substantial benefits Chinese bitcoin miners enjoy from being given cheap power.\nIf China were to build transmission lines that delivered energy more evenly across its economy, the argument that it was subsidizing its bitcoin mining industry would evaporate. The Chinese government may have international trade obligations that require it to withdraw the substantial benefit it now confers on its domestic bitcoin mining industry. Technological measures \u2014 such as, restraining blocksize limit, or fine tuning to reduce the amount of bandwidth it takes to propagate new blocks \u2014 are not the only tools in the Bitcoin community's toolbox.\nThis op-ed is a guest post by Jim Harper.

This year, the bitcoin community is aiming to demonstrate once again how important bitcoin is as an opportunity for charitable giving with\u00a0Bitcoin Giving Tuesday.\nHeld each year after Black Friday, Bitcoin Giving Tuesday \u2014 an extension of the global\u00a0#GivingTuesday \u2014 is when charities, companies and individuals raise money for their favorite causes. Taking place this year on November 29, Bitcoin Giving Tuesday is a new global movement that aims to raise the awareness of charities and individuals about the digital currency.\nWoodrow Rosenbaum is Executive Director of Canadian-based GIV3 Foundation, one of the founding partners of the Giving Tuesday movement in Canada. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, \u00a0he said that, when they initially launched the challenge in 2014, the Foundation had a lot of difficulty garnering interest due to the major price drop in bitcoin at the time. Now, however, things have changed.\n\u201cWe think there is [an] untapped opportunity for charitable giving in the bitcoin community and we would like to help charities understand and benefit from the opportunity,\u201d Rosenbaum said.\nHe adds that the GIV3 Foundation is looking at plans to relaunch the challenge at the end of November and running it through December.\n\u201cOur hope is that we can raise enough to fund some tools and resources for the global nonprofit community,\u201d Rosenbaum said. \u201cThat way we can... engage the bitcoin community in Giving Tuesday, so that they can get involved and help build another facet of the movement.\u201d\nOne bitcoin company\u00a0that is taking part is\u00a0The Bitcoin Store.\nAt the beginning of the month as part of Giving Tuesday, they announced that they would be donating 10 percent of their apparel sales from November 1 to 24 to Ronald McDonald House (RMcH) in Albany, in the Capital Region of New York. The charity, which is dedicated to improving the health, development and wellbeing of children and their families, also accepts bitcoin donations made directly via their website.\nAfter hearing about the digital currency from the NY Bitcoin Group, which facilitated the partnership, the RMcH began accepting bitcoin donations in November 2014. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Julia Patterson from The Bitcoin Store said that, as this was the company\u2019s first time taking part in Bitcoin Giving Tuesday, they wanted to make a positive impact on the world through the RMcH charity.\n\u201cThey provide extremely valuable services to very ill children and those children\u2019s families,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cAs they already accepted bitcoin, it made the partnership a no-brainer.\u201d\nThe proceeds from The Bitcoin Store will go directly into RMcH\u2019s Family First Fund, which will help pay for supplies and services for the families RMcH serves \u2014 such as, formula for severely ill infants and car repairs to make sure children can get to their medical appointments.\nJeff Yule, executive director of the Ronald McDonald House Charities of the Capital Region, said to Bitcoin Magazine that the charity has been humbled by the support that the bitcoin community has provided.\n\u201cWe have raised about $6350 through bitcoin efforts over the past two years, with most of that centered around Giving Tuesday,\u201d Yule said. \u201cMy experience is that Bitcoiners are dialed in and pretty discerning when it comes to investing into charities.\u201d\nFor Gianni D\u2019Alerta of the online Bitcoin merchandise store 51Attack, the BitGive Foundation was a natural choice for him to choose as the beneficiary of his company\u2019s Giving Tuesday Donations, due in part to the \u201ctenacity and experience\u201d of its founder, Connie Gallippi.\n\u201cThere are a handful of philanthropies established in the Blockchain world. BitGive was the first to become an official 501c3 non profit.\u201d said D\u2019Alerta. \u201cThe BitGive team is very transparent with their giving. I also support the different initiatives they have picked to apply their donations to.\u201d\nThe\u00a0SENS Research Foundation, a public charity that is transforming the way the world researches and treats age-related disease, is also taking part in Giving Tuesday. For SENS, Giving Tuesday is the day they receive the most donations, which are critical in supporting its programs and the administration of the foundation.\nVice President of Outreach at SENS, Jerri Barrett, said to Bitcoin Magazine that, as more people realize they accept bitcoin donations, there will be more engagement from the public who support their work.\n\u201cWe have had a number of very generous donors come to us now that we accept bitcoin,\u201d said Barrett. \u201cIt is still less than traditional donations \u2014 such as via PayPal or check \u2014 however, we are seeing it grow every month.\u201d\nIn 2015, SENS received several matching grants that were specific to Giving Tuesday, and they are hoping to secure additional ones this year. For 2016, the charity has two goals: increase the number of donors who do subscription donations each month, with a matching donation of up to $3,000 per month; and to raise $150,000, which will be matched by the\u00a0Forever Healthy Foundation. The money raised will support their programs such as their\u00a0OncoSENS and\u00a0MitoSENS internal research programs, their external programs, their outreach campaigns and their education programs.", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 28}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nFor the first time, bitcoin miners have been able to signal support for\u00a0Segregated\u00a0Witness this past week. Developed as a soft fork, the proposed centerpiece of\u00a0Bitcoin Core\u2019s\u00a0scalability roadmap requires 95 percent of all blocks within a single two week difficulty period to signal readiness for the change. If the threshold is reached, the solution is activated two weeks later, realizing an effective block size limit increase, a malleability fix and more.\nOf\u00a0all mining pools accounting for at least one percent of hash power on the network, four have been signaling support for Segregated Witness so far, together accounting for\u00a0about 26 percent of all newly mined blocks.\nHere is a brief overview.\nAntPool (~19 percent hash power)\nAntPool, the main mining arm of China-based ASIC-producer\u00a0Bitmain, has not been signaling support for Segregated Witness so far.\nAt the \u201cBitcoin Roundtable\u201d in Hong Kong last February, Bitmain and AntPool representatives signed a\u00a0letter supporting Segregated Witness, in return for a hard fork proposal to increase the block size limit from the Bitcoin Core developers present at the meeting. This hard fork proposal was scheduled to be presented within three months after the release of Segregated Witness \u2014 originally set for April. Due to a delay of Segregated Witness, however, the developers technically have until late next January to present the proposal.\nMuch has happened since the Hong Kong meeting, however, and interpretations of the agreement vary. Several of the signatories \u2014 including Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu and several Bitcoin Core developers \u2014 (seemingly) accused others of not upholding their part of the deal. Whether the developers will present a finished proposal before the end of January is uncertain.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine in May of this year, Wu\u00a0said his pool will not support Segregated Witness unless and until Bitcoin Core implements a block size hard fork. This currently seems unlikely to happen any time soon.\nF2Pool (~14 percent hash power)\nThe operator of the Chinese mining pool\u00a0F2Pool, Wang Chun, signed onto the Hong Kong Roundtable consensus as well. Though he did not comment on the status of the agreement, Chun told Bitcoin Magazine that he is currently experiencing technical difficulties keeping him from signaling support.\n\u201cSince our system cannot build C++11, I would like put this on hold for a while, until we can get our new servers online up and running,\u201d Chun said. \u201cNext spring, maybe.\u201d\nBTCC (~11 percent hash power) signals support\nChina-based Bitcoin exchange, wallet service and mining pool\u00a0BTCC signed the Hong Kong Roundtable letter. The company is one of the most outspoken proponents of Segregated Witness and is currently the biggest mining pool signaling support.\nSpeaking to\u00a0CoinTelegraph last week, BTCC COO Samson Mow explained:\n\u201cSegWit is great for Bitcoin. It brings more transaction throughput, fixes malleability, defrags the UTXO set, makes hardware wallets more secure and most importantly, it enables lightning, which will bring instant low cost Bitcoin transactions to the world. The team at BTCC have been working hard at making our exchange and mining pool services SegWit-ready.\u201d\nBW Pool (~10 percent hash power)\nBW Pool, China\u2019s fourth biggest mining pool and another signatory of the Hong Kong Roundtable letter, is currently not signaling support for Segregated Witness.\nEarlier this week, the mining pool did send out a\u00a0tweet stating: \u201cMining Pools Should Remain Neutral.\u201d This is in\u00a0agreement with Slush Pool\u2019s policy to let individual miners connected to the pool decide whether they want to signal support in blocks they find, rather than having the pool decide for them.\nIn response to a query from Bitcoin Magazine, BW Pool angel investor, Chandler Guo, confirmed the pool will let individual miners decide. Guo did not reveal further specifics, however, such as activation dates or potential default settings.\nBitFury (~7 percent hash power) signals support\nBitFury, a full-service Blockchain technology company and mining pool with roots in the Republic of Georgia, is currently the second largest pool signaling support for Segregated Witness.\nRepresentatives from BitFury also signed the Hong Kong Roundtable letter. And commenting on the block size issue at a conference in London, BitFury CEO Valery Vavilov\u00a0stated the \u201cblock size should be increased, but in a smart way,\u201d adding that \u201cthe solution which was deployed is pretty good: Segregated Witness.\u201d\nViaBTC (~6 percent hash power)\nOf all mining pools, the relatively new Chinese mining pool\u00a0ViaBTC is perhaps the strongest opponent of the Segregated Witness soft fork. In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine published last week, ViaBTC CEO Haipo Yang explained he will reject the proposed soft fork in favor of a block size limit increase hard fork.\n\u201cMy goal is not really to block Segregated Witness in and of itself, but to work towards a Bitcoin version I think is better,\u201d Yang said.\nHaoBTC (~6 percent hash power)\nRepresentatives from\u00a0HaoBTC, the Chinese exchange, wallet service and mining pool, signed onto the Hong Kong Roundtable consensus.\nIn June of this year, the company\u00a0published an open letter urging the Bitcoin Core developers present in Hong Kong to uphold their part of the deal \u2014 and asking for clarity. While the letter was quickly unpublished, the original content suggests HaoBTC was not fully happy with the (lack of) progress on the hard fork proposal. (Additionally, the original letter is said to have\u00a0included positive remarks concerning Segregated Witness.)\nHaoBTC is currently not signaling support for Segregated Witness, however.\nSlush Pool (~6 percent hash power) partially signals support\nPrague-based\u00a0Slush Pool, Bitcoin\u2019s oldest mining pool, will let individual hashers decide whether or not to signal support for Segregated Witness.\nIn an\u00a0article published on Bitcoin Magazine last week, pool operator Marek \u201cSlush\u201d Palatinus explained he wants to remove himself from the equation as a decision maker: \u201cSatoshi\u2019s idea was not to have a few entities control the network. As a mining pool we shouldn\u2019t rule.\u201d\nSlush Pool will signal support for Segregated Witness by default, but users can opt out if they want. This solution isn\u2019t quite ready yet at the moment, however. As a temporary solution, only users that \u201cvote\u201d in support of Bitcoin Core automatically vote for Segregated Witness.\nBTC.com (~5 percent hash power)\nBTC.com, a block explorer, wallet service, API-provider and open source mining pool owned by Bitmain, is currently not signaling support for Segregated Witness.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, BTC.com\u2019s mining pool operator, Kevin Pan, indicated that, in the short term, it will not signal support for Segregated Witness but will instead await further community consensus. Like AntPool, BTC.com\u2019s decision will most likely also depend on Bitmain\u2019s preference.\nGBMiners (~3 percent hash power)\nIndia-based\u00a0GBMiners, another relatively new mining pool, is not signaling support for Segregated Witness. In an interview with\u00a0CoinJournal, the mining pool did indicate that it is in favor of the Bitcoin Core fork\u00a0Bitcoin Unlimited, which has no plans to support Segregated Witness.\nUpdate: In reply to a query on Facebook on October 20, GBMiners representative Sanjay Goswami indicated (mirror) that his pool would would signal support for Segregated Witness.\nBitclub Network (~3 percent hash power) signals support\nBitclub Network is the fourth largest mining pool currently signaling support for Segregated Witness. Not much else is known about this pool.\n1Hash (~3 percent hash power)\nChinese mining pool\u00a01Hash is currently not signaling support for Segregated Witness. Not much else is known about this pool.\nBitcoin.com (~2 percent hash power)\nThe new\u00a0Bitcoin.com mining pool, operated by well-known Bitcoin angel investor and entrepreneur, Roger Ver, is currently not signaling support for Segregated Witness. Ver told Bitcoin Magazine that his pool \u201cisn't actively supporting or blocking SegWit,\u201d but will only support Segregated Witness if and when it is clear to him there is community consensus for the soft fork.\nVer also addressed what he considers to be the lack of opportunity for uncontested dialogue about the soft fork within popular Bitcoin forums\u00a0r/bitcoin and\u00a0Bitcointalk:\n\u201cThe problem with all the censorship that's been going on is that no one knows what the community consensus actually is.\u201d\nKano CK Pool (~2 percent hash power)\nKano CK Pool is not signaling support for Segregated Witness. In a\u00a0comment on Bitcointalk, Kano CKPool operator \u201ckano\u201d recently indicated the pool will keep mining standard Bitcoin blocks; blocks that do not support changes to the protocol.\n\u201cNo random attempts at changing BTC ... and also no SegWit indicators,\u201d kano said when asked which software the pool supports. \u201cSo I guess that means \u2018core\u2019 without SegWit voting.\u201d\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to (representatives from) AntPool, BTCC, BitFury, HaoBTC, Bitclub Network, GBMiners, 1Hash and Kano CK Pool, but received no response at time of publication.\nThis article has been updated with information regarding GBMiners.", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 25}

The company immediately responded with a Protecting Customer Privacy notice on their website:\n\n\u201cOur customers may be aware that the U.S. government filed a civil petition yesterday in federal court seeking disclosure of all Coinbase U.S. customers' records over a three year period.

We will continue to keep our customers informed on developments in this matter.\u201d\n\nBy law, Coinbase and other companies that purchase and sell bitcoins are required by regulators to capture identifying information on users who initiate purchase and sell orders on their platforms. Because bitcoin transactions generally do not share the identities of the people involved, tracking the flow of funds has arisen as a concern for the IRS.\nWhile guidelines for bitcoin users were established by the IRS in 2014, the tax agency has long alleged that is not receiving information from exchanges like Coinbase in order to ensure that proper tax payments are being captured.\nThis escalating development between the IRS and Coinbase could be a watershed moment for the future landscape of tax regulators, both in the U.S. and globally. Bitcoin evangelist and investor, Roger Ver, said to Bitcoin Magazine: \u201cIt seems very obvious that they (the IRS) are overstepping their already overly broad reach. It also makes me feel extra happy to not be American any longer, and to be a citizen of a country with a much more sane tax policy.\u201d\nAs the regulatory parameters of bitcoin taxation are being examined, questions abound as to whether digital currencies are emerging as a preferred method for tax evaders, given the worldwide crackdown taking place on offshore banks and other tax havens. Tax authorities could eventually end up in a challenging scenario from a monitoring and enforcement standpoint, given the rapid proliferation of digital currencies like Monero and zCash that feature increasing levels of privacy, complexity and security. By some estimates, the number of online market trades is well over 700 and growing by the day. Online sites CoinMarketCap and CoinCap offer an overview of the expansive nature of the digital currency landscape.\nLegal professional, Adella Toulon-Foerster, who spearheads the crypto/alternative currency practice at Cogent Law Group in Washington, D.C., told Bitcoin Magazine she believes the IRS's absurdly broad request is an obvious fishing expedition that in any sort of free society would never have passed the straight face test. \u00a0She also thinks that we are in the dark in terms of what will happen at the hands of a fickle judiciary that has often shown little regard for due process, and even less reluctance about unreasonable search and seizure.\nBut, she says, at least we know about this particular summons. \u201cIn an era of secret programs of mass surveillance, sneak and peek warrants, and secret courts that make 1984 look like a bedtime story, one can only imagine how little financial privacy bitcoin users really have, regardless of what is being made known to the public.\u201d\nThat said, she offers the reminder that, by definition, the blockchain is a publicly viewable ledger. \u201cEvery transaction provides another thread of information that can lead to the identity of a bitcoin account holder. Ultimately, the Bitcoin blockchain is like a giant game of Sudoku that federal law enforcement has the manpower and computing resources to win.\u201d\nPerry Woodin, a computer engineer and CEO of the blockchain governance company, Node40, offered a couple of pragmatic solutions for simplifying this tax environment. First, he says, the IRS needs to clarify and update their tax guidelines so that they are more digestible for the consumer.\n\u201cRight now the IRS is looking to reduce noncompliance among all these people who have these cryptocurrencies or digital assets. Problem is, I don\u2019t think most people quite know how they\u2019re supposed to report in order to comply. The guidance is currently not very clear, particularly in terms of how to calculate gains and losses.\u201d\nThis confusion ties to his second recommendation, which proposes the development of a software system or computer protocol that follows or establishes what the IRS uses for compliance guidelines, so that any user of, or investor in, digital currency can compile a report at the end of the fiscal year.\n\u201cIt would allow the person to show unrealized gains and losses from their entire virtual currency portfolio, and hand it to their accountant in a format that is easily understood, consistent and accurate. This national standard would provide this information in a manner consistent with the customized Portfolio Insight Reports that Node40 provides to its DASH clients.\u201d\nWooden believes that because the vast majority of all digital currency holdings are held in bitcoin, this was a logical place for the IRS to expand their U.S. enforcement efforts. \u201cThey wanted to go after bitcoin because that\u2019s the big fish in terms of figuring out how to work with all of these compliance issues. Once they figure bitcoin out, they are just going to apply their findings to all of the other digital currencies.\u201d\nThis is where things get a little tricky, according to Wooden. \u201cAll of this of course is tied to whether a particular cryptocurrency uses a transparent blockchain. zCash and Monero use an opaque blockchain and that means the only people who can verify a transaction on the blockchain are the parties to the transaction itself. So those people brazen enough to want to skirt this type of regulation would not only have to make use of a opaque blockchain, but would be subjected to having to live a full life of cryptocurrency without being able to ever cash out for fiat dollars. Because to do so the person would run the risk of being flagged.\u201d\nGiven the IRS crackdown, Wooden advises that those involved with holding or trading digital currencies, or using them for day-to-day transactions, should begin carefully documenting their transactions. Eventually, tax compliance is going to require the collection of more information, and the more organized users are in terms of their assets, the easier things will be when that day comes. \u201cIf you\u2019re just shifting assets all over the place, it\u2019s going to be a major headache and a real nightmare to comply with the tax reporting agencies.\u201d\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Coinbase with request for comment on this story; however, we did not receive a response.", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 23}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nLast February, in the midst of Bitcoin\u2019s long-lasting block size dispute, a group of\u00a0Bitcoin Core developers, Bitcoin miners, and representatives from the Bitcoin industry met in Hong Kong. Sealing their position with a\u00a0signed letter, the attendees agreed to run only Bitcoin Core-compatible consensus software for the \u201cforeseeable future.\u201d This avoided a potential hard fork as proposed by\u00a0Bitcoin Classic or\u00a0Bitcoin Unlimited \u2014 at least temporarily.\nOn their own behalf, the Bitcoin Core developers present at the meeting \u2014 Cory Fields, Johnson Lau, Luke Dashjr, Matt Corallo, and Peter Todd \u2014 agreed to propose a block size hard fork, with a deadline set three months after the release of\u00a0Segregated\u00a0Witness. If accepted by other Bitcoin Core developers and the broader Bitcoin community, the proposal could pave the way to a block size limit increase.\nAfter months of testing and some delay,\u00a0Bitcoin Core 0.13.1 became available to the public in the last week of October. With that, Segregated Witness was officially released.\nPer the original agreement from February, this leaves the signatories to the agreement\u2014who we\u2019ll call the \u201cHong Kong developers\u201d\u2014with about 10 more weeks to propose a hard fork.\nSoft-hardfork\nA typical hard fork essentially creates a new protocol and network to which all users must migrate, abandoning the old protocol in the process. Unfortunately, this presents an inherent risk that not all users switch. The original protocol can live on, essentially creating two distinct networks and currencies: a coin-split. That\u2019s exactly what happened on the Ethereum blockchain as a result of a contentious hard fork last summer, splitting into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.\nThe Hong Kong developers, therefore, prefer a \u201csoft-hardfork,\u201d also known as a \u201cforced soft fork\u201d or a \u201cfirm fork,\u201d and sometimes referred to as an \u201cevil soft fork.\u201d Like a typical hard fork, a soft-hardfork can change any protocol rule, including the block size limit. As Peter Todd told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cMany prefer a soft-hardfork for the perceived reduction in the chance that the currency will split.\u201d\nSpecifically, miners apply a soft-hardfork, through hash-power majority, by only mining \u201cempty\u201d blocks on the original protocol \u2014 blocks that contain no transactions. Users that stay behind on this \u201cold\u201d chain therefore can neither accept nor send any payments. In other words, they run no risk of being defrauded on an otherwise abandoned network.\nMeanwhile, all new transactions are moved to a sort of \u201cadd-on\u201d blockchain that only nodes that have upgraded for the soft-hardfork can see. While the original blockchain is still used for proof-of-work security, the new protocol exists in parallel.\nCoin-voting\nThe main drawback of a soft-hardfork is that it can be applied against the wish of users; in that sense, it\u2019s somewhat coercive. Unless they want to await a possible \u201creturn\u201d of miners to the original protocol, users have no choice but to upgrade to the new rules \u2014 or to hard fork to an entirely new protocol themselves, in effect creating a new network and currency after all.\nTo avoid both a coercive situation and a coin-split, the Hong Kong developers want solid indication that a soft-hardfork has consent from the Bitcoin community. They have therefore been considering two types of solutions to measure consent, both of them based on the coins controlled by users. Knows as \u201ccoin-signaling,\u201d this solution \u201cwould allow for much safer hard forks, by showing that Bitcoin holders and users actually approve of the fork,\u201d Todd said.\nOne of these methods \u2014 inspired by \u201chard fork opt-out bits\u201d \u2014 lets users include extra data in all transactions they make, thereby signaling support for a potential fork. If all transactions over a certain time frame include this data, they serve as an indication that users are ready to fork.\nTodd also has been developing a solution to let users vote with the coins they hold, even if they do not transact. On\u00a0his blog, Todd explained in August:\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working on coming up with more concrete mechanisms based on signaling/voting proportional to coins held, in particular, out-of-band mechanisms based on signed messages and probabilistic sampling that could potentially offer better privacy and censorship resistance, and give \u2018holders\u2019 who aren\u2019t necessarily doing frequent transactions a voice as well.\u201d\nThe Proposal\nYet, when it comes to a concrete proposal, some uncertainty remains.\nLuke Dashjr, who in addition to Bitcoin Core also maintains Bitcoin Knots,\u00a0presented an initial soft-hardfork\u00a0proposal and\u00a0preliminary code back in February, two weeks before the group met in Hong Kong. He kept improving it in the months that followed, and it\u2019s this proposal that forms the most concrete basis of the proposed \u201cHong Kong hard fork.\u201d\nThis proposal would increase the block size limit, though the exact size of the increase is yet to be specified. According to the Hong Kong Roundtable consensus, the increase should be around 2 MB, but will also include a reduced \u201cdiscount\u201d on witness-data to ensure that adversarial conditions don\u2019t allow blocks bigger than 4 MB. The proposal also includes further \u2014 rather uncontroversial \u2014 optimizations.\nProgress on development, though, has slowed down over the last months. This is in part because the Bitcoin miners did not seem very interested in the proposal, Todd said. Perhaps more importantly, several developers \u2014 both those in Hong Kong and others \u2014 consider the agreement to have been\u00a0broken by at least one counterparty in the deal: the Chinese mining pool\u00a0F2Pool.\n\u201cThe whole point of putting \u2018Run Bitcoin Core compatible clients\u2019 in the agreement was for miners to stop playing political games for a few months,\u201d Todd explained, \u201cand to give developers a reason to work with them. By not doing that, we've been totally unable to get any other developers to consider joining the effort, and if anything, the experience soured them on the very idea.\u201d\nAdditionally, most of the Hong Kong developers have seemingly come to believe that short-term community consensus on a block size limit hard fork is virtually impossible in the current climate.\n\u201cThe community clearly doesn\u2019t want a hard fork, and the Ethereum fiasco just sealed that,\u201d Luke Dashjr told Bitcoin Magazine.\nMoving Forward\nThat said, the Hong Kong developers will continue to work on the proposal \u2014 something Todd noted they were planning to do either way. Whether it will be finished within the allotted three months after the Segregated Witness release remains uncertain.\n\u201cNothing in that agreement on the developers\u2019 side was stuff we weren't interested in doing anyways,\u201d Todd said. \u201cThe whole point was to find some common ground that people didn't previously know they had ... So I'm still working on my part, which is to design and implement better approval mechanisms that don't rely on miners to approve forks \u2014 both soft and hard.\u201d\nDashjr also said he will continue to work on the proposal. While he is no longer strongly committed to presenting fully finalized hard-fork code within the original three-month deadline, he might. And he remains hopeful the solution will eventually be adopted.\n\u201cMaybe in a few years things will change,\u201d Dashjr said. \u201cAfter the \u2018hard fork\u2019 altcoiners go away.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 22}

With around 46,000 Central Texans, one-third of them children, lacking nutritious food each week, the funds raised during the event will help them gain access to food that they wouldn\u2019t otherwise be able to afford.\nThe concept behind the Cyberfunks Alliance is to build a broad-based, widely accessible network of urban, tech-savvy Bitcoin enthusiasts that can help bridge the gap between Bitcoin technology, the unbanked and the underbanked. They aim to achieve this by promoting bitcoin literacy through a fun-filled adventure where storytelling, teamwork and game play is the order of the day.\nTapping into the Unbanked and Underbanked Markets\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Poullard said that when people discuss issues regarding the unbanked, it tends to be in the context of developing countries.\n\u201cWhile they note accurately the high smartphone penetration, they paint pictures of places with poor infrastructure that have little to no internet access, people that speak little to no English and that have marginal economic development,\u201d he said.\nHowever, while he states that in certain aspects they may be right, for the purpose of bitcoin adoption, this is tantamount to fitting square pegs into round holes. This is particularly pertinent when there are 40 million unbanked Americans and another 49 million that are underbanked in the country, according to Federal Reserve statistics from April 2015.\n\u201cThese are people who are tech-savvy, social-media savvy, smartphone users,\u201d said Poullard. \u201cA prime demographic for bitcoin usage and almost none of them are even aware this technology exists.\u201d\nReaching out to the 40 million American smartphone users that don\u2019t have bank accounts is not a matter of bringing diversity into Bitcoin, it\u2019s simply good business, according to Poullard. Yet, despite $1.1 billion in venture capital being poured into the space as of May 2016, this is a problem that has gone unaddressed and apparently ignored in the Bitcoin space.\nAs of 2009, half of the workers in the world earned a living in the informal economy, which is an economy that is neither taxed nor monitored by any form of government, and that figure is growing. It is predicted that two thirds of the world\u2019s workforce, or 2.4 billion people, will be unbanked by 2020, according to Robert Neuwirth the author of The Stealth Of Nations: The Global Rise of the Informal Economy.\n\u201cIn essence, the efforts to use bitcoin exchange business models is an exercise in futility,\u201d said Poullard. \u201cIn other words, unbanked is the new banked.\u201d\nA 2015 blog from\u00a0GfK, a market and consumer information website, found that while mobile banking wins big, it is the underbanked \u2014 younger generations, minorities and those with low levels of income \u2014 \u00a0who are the most connected, with 66 percent owning a smartphone, but who don\u2019t use a traditional financial institution.\nAccording to Poullard, of the top ten largest unbanked/underbanked cities in the U.S., the top three are in Texas: El Paso, Dallas and Houston.\nHe believes, however, that it will be easy to bridge the gap because most Bitcoin development and adoption efforts are taking place in the U.S., and until the Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure is built out, humans will be the primary users of this technology.\nAs money is the biggest market there is, Bitcoin has the potential to upend the entire financial system. The loop will only be closed once more people accept bitcoin, making fiat currency unnecessary and undesired.\nDuring the last major bitcoin price increase in 2013, the narrative was about achieving mainstream or mass adoption, according to Poullard. He states, however, that most in the space have conflated the two.\n\u201cMass appeal means that your target market can and does use your product, while mass adoption means that those inside your target market, outside of it, plus so-called 'undesirables' use it as well,\u201d he said.\nHowever, despite Bitcoin\u2019s existence since 2009, mass adoption has yet to be achieved. Not only that, but it seems as though the bitcoin tradeshow model will not be enough to increase adoption. According to the Cyberfunks Alliance, the Bitcoin protocol, like the internet before it, holds the promise of becoming the next disruptive technology of the digital age. Yet with a protocol that is not easy to grasp for the average layperson, these tech-heavy conferences can leave people with more unanswered questions than what they arrived with. The worry then is that Bitcoin\u2019s protocol will remain a promise unfulfilled.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Fred Constantinesco, co-founder of the Cyberfunks Alliance, said that adoption attempts often fail because they either make things too complicated for the average smartphone user, or after teaching people, they don\u2019t follow up with more information. \u201cGiving someone a wallet and a small amount of bitcoin is great, but it won\u2019t lead to adoption alone.\u201d\nUtilizing the Power of Play\nHow do you get large groups of non-technical people to understand a technically complicated subject?\nThe Cyberfunks Alliance hopes to achieve this through their event, Bitcoin Awakens. Their mission is to help people change the way they perceive and use bitcoin through the power of play.\nIn teams of three, players will compete in 15 quests together in camaraderie on a digital currency obstacle course that is a parody of scenarios from the Stars Wars universe.\nTeams will solve challenges related to the bitcoin network based on five rudimentary knowledge areas: the value of digits; monetary theory; open source software; decentralization/distributed networks; and public key cryptography.\n\u201cWe decided to use [what3words] to enhance our game mechanics and make things more compelling, novel [and] fun,\u201d said Poullard. \u201cIn the story arc, teams must solve challenges and are rewarded with clues in the form of 3-word coordinates.\u201d\nThe geo-locating platform what3words has mapped out a global grid of 57 trillion 3m by 3m squares that can provide addressing capability in lieu of traditional geographic latitude-longitude coordinates. Each square on the grid is identified with an easy-to-recall 3-word sequence.\nPlayers earn clues and learn about bitcoin technology while conducting blockchain transactions required to unlock coordinates to various obstacles.\n\u201cEach clue leads like a breadcrumb trail back to the final challenge and the victory party,\u201d said Poullard.\nThe final challenge in honor of Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of the Bitcoin protocol, is to discover a secret location.\nUnlike a typical Bitcoin conference, says Poullard, Cyberfunks Alliance is an event series and not a one-off, annual conference, so they don\u2019t have the same constraints and can ideally produce one show a week.\n\u201cWe\u2019re providing a crash course, hands-on, trial-by-fire bitcoin experience that\u2019s epic, lucrative and fun,\u201d he said. \u201cLots of conferences have the same speakers, talk about the same topics, on a conference carousel that features content one could easily consume via YouTube from the comfort of their own home.\u201d\nAccording to the Cyberfunks Alliance, pop culture, more than anything else, is America\u2019s greatest export. They believe tapping into that will drive bitcoin\u2019s mass adoption. Think Snapchat or the Pok\u00e9mon Go phenomenon.\n\u201cWhen Pok\u00e9mon gets more children playing outside in one weekend than Michelle Obama did in eight years, you can see that the power of play works,\u201d said Constantinesco. \u201cGetting people to use bitcoin is okay, [but] getting people to continue using bitcoin is the issue.\u201d\nThe Cyberfunks Alliance has listed a store through OpenBazaar, allowing people to donate to the Central Texas Food Bank with 100 percent of bitcoin donations going straight to the Food Bank. They can also buy tickets to the Bitcoin Awakens event for $99.00, with 10 percent of the purchase ticket price going to the hunger-relief charity, with no processing fee or middleman involved, making it an ideal donation platform.", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 24}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nToday marks the release of\u00a0Bitcoin Core version 0.13.1. This is the official introduction of Segregated Witness, the long-awaited centerpiece of Bitcoin Core\u2019s\u00a0scalability road map. Starting November 15, Bitcoin miners can signal support for the proposed protocol upgrade, which, if activated, enables a number of new features on the Bitcoin network as well as an effective block size limit increase.\nAccording to\u00a0Bitcoin Core developer and\u00a0Ciphrex Co-CEO, Eric Lombrozo, \u201cSegregated Witness is the biggest extension of the protocol to date.\u201d\nSegregated Witness\nSegregated Witness is a proposed upgrade to the Bitcoin protocol first introduced by Bitcoin Core and\u00a0Blockstream developer, Dr. Pieter Wuille, at the\u00a0Scaling Bitcoin conference in Hong Kong in December of 2015. The technological innovation separates signature data from Bitcoin transactions. This has several advantages, including \u2014 but not limited to \u2014 a malleability fix, more flexible programmability, and an effective block size limit increase.\n\u201cIt's the most significant improvement to the protocol to date, and lots of exciting innovations become possible as a result,\u201d Lombrozo told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe're going through a period of tremendous innovation \u00a0in Bitcoin \u2014 the greatest innovations since Bitcoin\u2019s inception are taking place right now.\u201d\nSegregated Witness has been in the pipeline for almost year. Wuille started coding it in November 2015, and was joined by Lombrozo, Johnson Lau and several other Bitcoin Core developers in the following months. Counting almost 5,000 lines of code, Segregated Witness was completed last April.\nSince that time, the proposed innovation has been subject to rigorous checks and analysis. Lombrozo explained:\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot of review, and a lot of testing. We\u2019ve had three dedicated Segregated Witness test networks, and it has been successfully running on Bitcoin\u2019s main testnet since May. Additionally, compact blocks had to be developed and integrated in Bitcoin Core to mitigate latency and bandwidth issues. This was included in the latest version, 0.13.0.\u201d\nActivation\nSegregated Witness is a proposed soft fork; a change that technically makes Bitcoin\u2019s protocol rules more restrictive.\nActivation will follow the standards as established by\u00a0Bitcoin Improvement Improsal (BIP)9. This means that, within a single difficulty period of 2016 blocks (about two weeks), at least 95 percent of blocks must be mined by a miner that signals support for Segregated Witness. If this threshold is reached, the following difficulty period allows everyone who wants to upgrade the chance to do so. After that, Segregated Witness support is activated, and Segregated Witness transactions are accepted by Bitcoin miners.\nSignaling will start on November 15. In the earliest possible scenario, this means that Segregated Witness could activate by mid-December. That seems somewhat unlikely at this time, however. A relatively new Chinese mining pool \u2014\u00a0ViaBTC \u2014 recently indicated it will not support a Segregated Witness soft fork. As ViaBTC currently controls about 9 percent of all hash power on the network, it could effectively block activation \u2014 assuming it remains above at least 5 percent.\nLombrozo indicated that the Bitcoin Core development team is not too worried, however.\n\u201cChanges to the consensus rules are hard by design,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this case, I think the benefits vastly outweigh the risks, as Segregated Witness enables a bunch of new innovation in Bitcoin that will improve scalability and will allow for more use cases. My hope is that miners will appreciate these great benefits and will want to take advantage of this significant improvement to the protocol.\u201d\nIf Segregated Witness is not supported by 95 percent of hash power by November 15, 2017, it can no longer activate. Until then, it\u2019s unlikely that Bitcoin Core developers will present an alternative proposal, Lombrozo said.\n\u201cWe've worked very hard to find a path forward that gives everyone in the ecosystem something they want,\u201d said Lombrozo. \u201cIt's not always possible to please everyone, but we've made a great effort. We put this forward for the community. I hope the community appreciates our work and likes what we've done.

These solutions will address critical issues, such as data privacy on a private blockchain, scalability for market data applications and critical interoperability across Ethereum and complementary technologies.\n\u201cWhile blockchain has the potential to be a transformative technology, financial institutions need highly-customized applications that take into consideration their business operations and unique technical requirements,\u201d said Synechron Co-Founder and CEO, Faisal Husain. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to be working with ConsenSys and BlockApps to collaborate with them on the next generation of blockchain infrastructure financial institutions will need for blockchain adoption. As those changes are made, Synechron will be the first to implement them and make them ready for financial services to accelerate adoption across banks.\u201d\nIn September, New York based Synechron launched its Blockchain Accelerator Program and their six first blockchain applications in the cloud (Accelerators) for trade finance, KYC utilities, payments, smart margins, mortgages, and insurance claims. According to the company, the new applications enable financial services firms to prototype solid blockchain applications within weeks.\nNow, ConsenSys and BlockApps will provide Synechron with specialized development tools, such as ConsenSys\u2019s Ethereum blockchain development tools and BlockApps\u2019 Ethereum blockchain infrastructure STRATO, which could enable new accelerators for total return swaps, call spreads, syndicated loans, bond issuance, tokenized securities and tokenized fiat currencies. In return, ConsenSys and BlockApps will be able to leverage Synechron\u2019s customer base and \u2014 with a 6,000-person global team of specialized consultants \u2014 extensive presence in the financial services sector.\n\"The combination and depth of ConsensSys's role as a founding father of Blockchain infrastructure (Ethereum) combined with our business consulting expertise makes for a powerful partnership that delivers the depth and scale to take Blockchain and make it more mainstream,\u201d Faisal Husain, Synechron CEO, said to Bitcoin Magazine.\n\u201cConsenSys is advising providers and financial services firms on how to evolve the technologies to address evolutionary issues like scalability, interoperability and data privacy,\u201d said ConsenSys Founder and CEO Joseph Lubin. \u201cSynechron will allow us to amplify the speed of adoption of these new technology capabilities as they are introduced to blockchain infrastructures, so that their clients are working on the absolute latest technologies. In addition to this bandwidth extension, Synechron\u2019s specialized financial services knowledge has already been a valuable feedback loop, so that we are setting our agenda to prioritize how to evolve the technology according to the unique needs of the financial services industry.\u201d\nIt\u2019s worth noting that ConsenSys and BlockApps have also partnered with Microsoft for Ethereum blockchain applications in the cloud. In November, Bitcoin Magazine covered the announcement of ConsenSys\u2019 partnership with Microsoft. In December, Microsoft and ConsenSys announced Ethereum Blockchain as a Service (EBaaS) on Azure \u2014 Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing platform \u2014 to provide a single-click, cloud-based blockchain developer environment to Azure Enterprise clients and developers. In June, the two companies started developing an open source, blockchain-based identity system for people, products, apps and services. BlockApps\u2019 STRATO was also chosen by Microsoft as a technology platform for customized blockchain ledgers, with support for Ethereum smart contracts, in EBaaS.\n\u201cBlockApps continues to deploy within enterprises throughout the world, and we\u2019ve found Synechron to be an ideal partner to help scale and further increase education and adoption of our customizable product,\u201d said BlockApps Co-Founder and CEO Victor Wong. \u201cSynechron is a driving force in the financial services technology space, and their understanding and implementation of Ethereum blockchain solutions continues to show their commitment to bleeding-edge technology.\u201d\n\u201cThis partnership brings together a unique combination of technical depth and business expertise needed to scale real-world Blockchain projects,\u201d said Husain. \u201cIt brings together a unique combination of technical depth and business expertise needed to scale real-world Blockchain projects.\"\nIn June, Bitcoin Magazine interviewed Husain about the potential long-term impact of blockchain and other emerging technologies on the financial sector.\n\u201cFinancial services are built on huge stacks of data, and so there is huge potential value in using AI to garner insights, predict patterns and help make decisions,\u201d Husain said, at the time.\nAccording to the results of a study sponsored by Synechron, the combination of blockchain technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to have a major impact on financial services over the next 10 years.", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 27}

The Mediachain Attribution Engine application will help users find high quality and properly attributed images that can be used for any visual imaging needs \u2014 on websites, in blog posts and presentations, and more\u00a0\u2014 while allowing publishers and creators to secure the rights of their digital content.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Mediachain Labs Co-Founder, Denis Nazarov, said that unattributed content shared on the internet not only gives rise to plagiarism but also prevents people from connecting with the content creators. He adds, \u201cattribution is fundamental to the creative process because it guarantees that creators can connect directly with their fans, but the currently available content attribution systems are inefficient.\u201d\n\u201cPeople care about connecting with creators, but the ability to easily do that is currently broken. It's really easy to share images by copy and pasting them, but that usually means you break the chain linking to the creator,\u201d Nazarov said. \u201cThis means that when someone is looking at a great image that they love in their feed, they have no idea who made it or anything about it.\u201d\n\u201cThe goal of Attribution Engine is so that audiences can always connect, like, upvote or even tip, someone whose work they admire directly through the media itself.\u201d\nHow it Works\nThe Mediachain Attribution Engine is built on top of the Mediachain open media library project. It will allow publishers and content creators to upload their content and attach information to their media, which will then be time-stamped in the Bitcoin blockchain and stored in the IPFS. The information can then be looked up via perceptual search using an instance of the media itself.\n\u201cAttribution Engine makes attribution as easy as copy/paste, and more importantly, all the data Attribution Engine is built on is open and decentralized, meaning any developer can download the data, or even extend it by contributing directly to Mediachain,\u201d Mediachain Labs\u00a0Co-Founder Jesse Walden said to Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThis means Mediachain attribution can be automatically integrated in any application. It gives developers access to a universal, open media library full of great content that they can use in new, innovative media applications, obviating the need for consumers to manually attribute content.\u201d\nUsers can search the Mediachain open library database using the Mediachain Attribution Engine for images they want to share. Once they find an image they like, they can copy and paste the html code of the link to their blog post or website. The attribution for the image is embedded in the html code itself, hence there is no further need on part of the user to manually attribute the image. The Mediachain Attribution Engine currently doesn\u2019t support sharing of the images directly to social media sites, but Navarov said they are looking forward to adding that feature.\n\u201cThe internet is really good at helping creators reach a large audience, but when media is shared virally, it often loses any connection to it's creator, it\u2019s orgin and it\u2019s story,\u201d said Walden. \u201cMediachain enables a channel to discover the identity of the creator anywhere their media is shared, enabling a connection with the full scale of their audience so they can derive all the benefits of achieving scale on the internet.\nHe added, \u201cIt's important to note that this means there is more incentive for creators to post great content online, as opposed to approaches that try to impose artificial scarcity for media that is categorically \u2018out there.\u2019\u201d\nFuture Prospects \nThe current participants in the Mediachain project are The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), Getty Images, the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) and Europeana Collections. All of the content on the Mediachain database is used under the Creative Commons license; however, Nazarov said that their goal is to expand to commercially licensed content that will allow creators and publishers to monetize their content.\n\u201cCreative Commons is our first use to demonstrate how Mediachain works end-to-end,\u201d Nazarov said. \u201cWe think openly-licensed media is a great fit for a decentralized media library. But the goal is to expand to commercially-licensed content in the near future. The same channel that is used to transfer attention directly to creators in Attribution Engine today can be used to send a payment tomorrow, all with no middlemen.\u201d\nMediachain is currently accepting attributed content from verified Creative Commons sources only, including any Creative Commons images from Flickr, a site that is often mined for images. The Attribution Engine for creators is currently in private beta but interested parties can sign up for the public beta here.", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 26}

Announced on Monday October 24 at Money 20/20 in Las Vegas, this move brings together BitPay\u2019s merchant payment tools with a growing compendium of consumer options, all in one place.\nThis new app aims to offer security and ease of use in a manner appealing to non-technical users who may otherwise steer away from bitcoin. It allows for the conversion of bitcoin to dollars through an integrated BitPay Visa\u00ae Prepaid debit card, currently the only US-wide debit card for bitcoiners. Bitcoin can be purchased and sold by users via exchanges \u2014 all through the app. These features offer users a convenient means of aligning their digital and traditional finance worlds, without leaving BitPay.\nWhile many similar services have been launched, most require users to maintain their bitcoin in company-managed accounts, leading to increased vulnerability to security breaches and hacks. The BitPay app overcomes these concerns by allowing users full control over their funds at all times through device-based private keys, backup protocol and multi-device authentication. When the app is downloaded, new users are offered a simple tutorial with steps for easy navigation.\nThis move, according to BitPay CEO, Stephen Pair, provides a \u201cnew way to bring more users and companies into the bitcoin ecosystem.\u201d He notes that the BitPay app is currently available on all mobile and desktop platforms.\n\u201cThis app is built on years of work spent refining the bitcoin payment experience with BitPay merchants and building a more secure bitcoin wallet with the Copay platform,\u201d BitPay Marketing and Communications Manager, James Walpole, said to Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe think we\u2019ve been able to answer one of the core problems that have locked new users out of bitcoin: how to offer a beginner-friendly experience that doesn\u2019t sacrifice security. This app is a way to get everything you need to start right with bitcoin, without trusting your money to a third party that can be hacked.\u201d\nBitPay jumps into the project with solid track record of delivering bitcoin payment tools for companies like Microsoft, Steam and Newegg.com. The company has also been cultivating Copay \u2014 an open source, multi-signature platform that allows users to store multiple, distinct bitcoin wallets in order to keep their funds carefully separated.\nNews of this app release follows another recent announcement involving BitPay \u2014 its role in assisting the betting site NetBet\u2019s efforts to become the first online gambling operator licensed by the U.K. Gambling Commission (UKGC) to offer deposit and withdrawal options in bitcoin for online sports betting and casinos. This initiative is expected to take hold among the U.K.\u2019s growing digital currency community as a safer and more secure environment for gaming interests.\nAnd on September 29, BitPay announced the launch of its modal invoice, a feature that allows for the automation of refunds for bitcoin payment exceptions. It addresses a common issue that continues to haunt new users, namely, instances where an incorrect amount of bitcoin is sent to a BitPay merchant. This new feature offers a means of handling these so called \u201cpayment acception\u201d in an easy and streamlined manner that allows users a means of requesting refunds for overpayments and underpayments. For instance, shoppers who underpay, now have a mechanism for retrying their orders; and shoppers who have overpaid, can get their funds returned more quickly. The hope is that this new feature will be a benefit to merchant and consumer alike, allowing for the rapid correction of payments in a more seamless manner.\n\u201cA year from now, we\u2019d like the BitPay app to be the wallet that expert bitcoiners use to secure their bitcoin savings and live life on bitcoin,\" said Walpole. \"We also want BitPay to be the wallet people think of when they want to get off to the right start with bitcoin, from getting their first bitcoin, to storing and spending funds securely.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 26}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin right now is\u00a0not really anonymous. Monitoring the unencrypted peer-to-peer network, analyzing the public blockchain or Know Your Customer (KYC) policies and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations can reveal a lot about who is using Bitcoin and for what.\nThis is not great from a privacy perspective. For example, Bitcoin users might not necessarily want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own; similarly, businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors.\nAdditionally, the fact that the transaction history of each bitcoin is traceable puts the\u00a0fungibility of all bitcoins at risk. \u201cTainted\u201d bitcoins may be valued less than other bitcoins, possibly even calling into question Bitcoin's value proposition as money.\nBut privacy and fungibility can be improved. An older method to break a link of transactions \u2014 CoinSwap \u2014 was recently revived and improved upon, with promising results. TumbleBit, as the new solution is called, is set to realize a completely private and trustless mixing service \u2014 and even offers increased scalability as a bonus.\nCoinSwap\nA key problem for privacy and fungibility is that Bitcoin-addresses are trivially linkable. If Alice pays Bob a bitcoin, blockchain analysis reveals that their addresses did the transaction.\nTo break this link,\u00a0Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell\u00a0proposed CoinSwap, first introduced on the Bitcointalk forum in 2013.\nThe idea behind CoinSwap is very simple: it uses an intermediary for payment. If Alice pays one bitcoin to an intermediary, and this intermediary pays a different bitcoin to Bob, Alice will have effectively paid one bitcoin to Bob, but no link exists between their addresses on the blockchain.\nThe problem is that this intermediary can steal funds. If Alice pays the intermediary a bitcoin, the intermediary can simply decide not to pay Bob, and instead keep the bitcoin.\nThis is solved with Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs). Alice and the intermediary set up a special type of payment channel, while Bob and the intermediary set up a payment channel as well. Through clever Bitcoin tricks that include embedding dedicated cryptographic keys in transactions, these payment channels are effectively linked. Bob can claim one bitcoin from the payment channel between him and the intermediary, but only in such a way that the intermediary can also claim a bitcoin from the payment channel between him and Alice. No one can steal funds.\n(The specifics of HTLC is beyond the scope of this article; for more details see \u2018Understanding the Lightning Network, Part 2: Creating the Network\u2019.)\nCoinSwap breaks the link of transactions on the blockchain. But, unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t solve all privacy and fungibility issues just yet. Most importantly, the intermediary still knows that Alice transacted with Bob. The intermediary can re-establish the link.\nThese issues are what the new TumbleBit improvement solves.\nTumbleBit\nTumbleBit was\u00a0proposed by Boston University\u2019s Ethan Heilman, Leen Alshenibr, Foteini Baldimtsi, Alessandra Scafuro and Sharon Goldberg last summer, and was recently\u00a0presented at the\u00a0Scaling Bitcoin workshops in Milan.\nTumbleBit resembles CoinSwap, but adds three important features.\nFirst, it adds anonymity in numbers. TumbleBit allows many users \u2014 \u00a0many \u201cAlices\u201d and many \u201cBobs\u201d \u2014 \u00a0to set up payment channels with the same intermediary. And all Alices can send bitcoins to all Bobs through that intermediary.\nSecond, the payment channels between the intermediary and all Bobs are replaced by sophisticated cryptographic puzzles. If Bob can provide the solution to the puzzles, he can claim \u2014 \u00a0say \u2014 a bitcoin. The trick is that Alice buys the answers for these puzzles from the intermediary for a bitcoin. She then sends the answer to Bob as payment, which Bob will happily accept since he can claim a bitcoin with it.\nAnd importantly: all this is done through several layers of cryptography. This ensures that the intermediary does not know which solution he sold to which Alice, nor do the Alices know which puzzle solution they gave to Bob. As such, once the Bobs claim their bitcoins, the intermediary sees that puzzles are solved. But due to the anonimity in numbers, the intermediary cannot link any of the Alices to any of the Bobs.\nAnd third, the Alices and Bobs can fund their payment channels with the intermediary such that they can make several payments. And again, any Alice can pay any Bob; it doesn\u2019t need to be the same Bob each time. This makes the intermediary a useful payment hub.\nFurthermore, these puzzle-solving transactions between all Alices, the intermediary, and all Bobs, never hit the blockchain. Rather, once everyone is done transacting, the end-state of all payment channels is recorded on the blockchain once, to let everyone take their funds out. TumbleBit is a scalable second-layer payment hub on top of a privacy-friendly solution.\nReality\nLast but not least: TumbleBit can be realized without requiring any changes to the Bitcoin protocol.\nThe team from Boston University has already coded a\u00a0proof of concept and run successful tests on the blockchain. While the software is not quite ready for production use yet, it is open source and free for anyone to use and contribute to.\nFurthermore, TumbleBit really only requires a single party to establish the service. In fact, it would be better if only one (or very few) parties offer it: if everyone uses the same TumbleBit service, that one service offers great anonymity in numbers. (Since it\u2019s completely trustless, centralization is not an issue.)\nAnd since fees are trivially implemented in the design, moreover, there is even an incentive to establish a TumbleBit server. It seems it\u2019s only a matter of time before someone realizes this potential.\nThanks to Ethan Heilman for information and feedback.\nFor technical details on TumbleBit, see the TumbleBit\u00a0white paper, the TumbleBit\u00a0presentation\u00a0at Scaling Bitcoin Milan, or Adam Gibson\u2019s TumbleBit for the tumble-curious.", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 25}

She has been writing about technology for nearly two decades. You can follow her @girlandgrowl on Twitter.\nBlockchain company Gem aims to tackle one of the biggest issues in health care insurance claim payments: providers have to wait a long time to get paid. Moving toward that goal, the ambitious startup just scored a major partnership with Capital One.\nIn a recent press release, Capital One announced it is \u201creinventing\u201d its treasury management platform to include, among other things, advances in health care claims applications. As part of that, the financial conglomerate is partnering with several digital technology providers, including Gem.\n\u201cBlockchain technology connects the ecosystem to universal infrastructure, and shared infrastructure allows global standards that do not compromise privacy and security,\u201d said Capital One in its press statement.\n\u201cWhen providers don\u2019t get paid in a timely fashion, it creates inefficiencies that echo across the entire ecosystem, and this is a massive issue in health care,\u201d explained Emily Vaughn, Director of Client Relations and Marketing for Gem.\nGem\u2019s core product is GemOS, an abstraction layer designed to make blockchains useful for enterprise clients by connecting their existing software to shared ledgers. According to Vaughn, GemOS is similar to an operating system, in that it serves as a platform for managing data, identities and rules on a blockchain.\nTo get an idea of how this works consider that, in a basic workflow revenue cycle, the health care provider will creates a claim. They in turn send it to the payer, who then approves or denies the payment portion of it. Then the payer sends that information to their bank, who then sends money to the provider\u2019s bank.\nIn that workflow, you have four companies all running on different systems trying to communicate about the same event. On a shared ledger, you need instead four identities, four permissioned users on the network.\nThe GemOS key management service creates identities for the payer, provider and their respective banks, using hierarchical deterministic (HD) identity keychains. HD keychains were invented to secure bitcoin and are now the industry standard. They allow the user to have a secret key that generates many public keys to protect the identity of the user.\n\u201cLike a bitcoin wallet, your blockchain identity can store data, such as credentials, \u201d said Vaughn. \u201cYou use that identity to sign transactions, which is now visible to other users who could be using different software. We call this, Multiparty Identity and Access Management.\u201d\nIn that sense, GemOS acts like a permission layer between different blockchains, controlling who should have access to data stored in disparate siloed systems, as well as when they should have that access.\nIt is not uncommon for large enterprises to have critical data spread across different systems that don\u2019t communicate well with one another. In the health care industry, those interoperability issues can lead to payments delays and other problems, like patients not having access to a complete aggregated view of their health. But privacy is also a huge issue in health care, making it doubly difficult to gain access to enterprise systems.\nEarlier this month, at the\u00a0Distributed: Health conference in Nashville, Tennessee, Gem introduced its Revenue Cycle Management (RCM), a pilot project that runs on the GemOS platform and is supported by the Gem Health Network, a network for developing applications and shared infrastructure for healthcare powered by the Ethereum blockchain.\n\u201cThe Gem Health Network is the blockchain network we spun out so our customers can build applications in a sandbox environment where they can test their application\u2019s ability to leverage a shared infrastructure, which is the blockchain network,\u201d said Vaughn.\nPhilips Blockchain Lab, a research and development center of healthcare giant Philips, was the first major healthcare operator to partner with Gem. Capital One is now the second.\n\u201cAt Capital One we see the new network models and data analytics capabilities as an exciting opportunity to reinvent treasury management to better meet the needs of clients, not only increasing payment efficiency but also generating actionable information about their business,\u201d Capital One Executive Vice President, Patrick Moore, said.\nNearly a year ago, Capital One was one of several financial industry players to invest a total of $30 million in Chain.com, a blockchain developer platform that serves the fintech industry. Its current partnership with Gem marks the first time Capital One has publicly announced the intention to use a blockchain in one of its actual products.", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 26}

Chain Core is a different technology, but equally suited to deployment in the cloud.\n\u201cMicrosoft believes the potential for blockchain technology to digitally transform the financial industry is enormous.\u201d said Microsoft\u2019s Azure blockchain engineering manager, Marley Gray. \u201cWe are pleased to support the operation of the Chain testnet on Microsoft Azure Blockchain as a Service and look forward to collaborating with the ecosystem to enable financial institutions to adopt distributed ledger technology.\u201d\n\u201cChain\u2019s technology is definitely not hype,\u201d said blockchain technology expert Emin Gun Sirer, a Cornell University professor of Computer Science, as reported by Bloomberg Markets. \u201cThey are one of the most credible blockchain providers out there.\u201d Gun Sirer added that Chain\u2019s focus on financial services \u201cmakes it unique,\u201d and the open source release of Chain Core Developer Edition is a big step.\nChain's Recent\u00a0Progress\nIn September 2015, Visa, Nasdaq, Citi and other industry players invested $30 million in Chain.\n\u201cWe are thrilled to be partnering with the organizations we believe are best positioned to capitalize on the inevitable changes in market structure that are on the horizon,\u201d said Chain CEO and Co-Founder Adam Ludwin at the time.\n\u201cVisa\u2019s investment in Chain underscores our long-standing commitment to explore technology, like the blockchain, that could have the potential to advance secure and convenient digital payments for our clients and their customers,\u201d added Jim McCarthy, Global Head of Innovation and Strategic Partnerships at Visa.\nIn May, Chain announced the public release of Chain Open Standard 1 (Chain OS 1), an open source blockchain protocol developed in collaboration with global financial services firms, including Capital One, Citigroup, Fidelity, First Data, Fiserv, MUFG, Nasdaq, State Street, and Visa.\n\"We have been working diligently with our industry partners to release our protocol and software to meet the requirements of the financial services industry,\" said Ludwin in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine after Chain announced a partnership with The Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts (IC3) in August. \"The next step for Chain is to bring our partner networks to production. Testing and rolling out such a system is a deliberate exercise.\"", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 25}

She has been writing about technology for nearly two decades. You can follow her @girlandgrowl on Twitter.\nZcash (ZEC), the new digital currency lauded for its privacy features, is launching today amidst some massive hype. But until enough tokens become available on exchanges, Zcash enthusiasts are poised to acquire their ZEC first-hand by mining for it, either by setting up a home rig or by signing up for a cloud mining contract.\nCreated from a fork of Bitcoin's codebase, Zcash promises all the best features and stability of Bitcoin with the added bonus of total payment confidentiality. Zcash transactions can be shielded to hide the sender, recipient and value of all transactions on the blockchain. Only those with the correct view key can see the contents.\nAnother interesting aspect of Zcash is it uses a memory-hard proof-of-work known as Equihash. This means the best hardware for mining Zcash tokens is standard GPUs and RAM. The hope is this will lead to a more decentralized set of miners.\n\u201cWe think it is unlikely that anyone will be able to build cost-effective custom hardware (ASICs) for mining in the foreseeable future,\u201d Zcash CEO and founder, Zooko Wilcox, and software engineer, Jack Grigg, wrote in a blog post.\nSince Zcash did not hold an initial crowdfund, every Zcash token issued will be as a result of mining. And it\u2019s likely that mining, especially in the early days, will be cheaper than purchasing Zcash on an exchange.\nMining for ZEC\nThere are two ways to mine Zcash: you can build your own GPU rig \u2014 arguably, with good mining software, you can use a CPU as well, but more on that later \u2014 or you can mine Zcash in the cloud.\nBuilding your own GPU is not easy. When you buy an ASIC for mining bitcoin, you simply connect it to the internet and plug in the power. But GPU mining is a custom setup, where you need to source motherboards and graphic cards. \u00a0\nBecause of the work involved, cloud mining make might make sense for some people, though it carries more associated risk. To that end, several cloud GPU providers are open for Zcash business. Genesis Mining is offering a limited number of one-year contracts. Toomim Brothers is offering Zcash cloud mining on three, six and 12 month contracts.\nIf you are setting up your own CPU or GPU rigs, you will need to find an efficient mining software. Zcash recently held an open source miner challenge, and made all the submissions available to the public.\nSlow Start and the Founders Reward\nMining will begin with a \u201cslow start,\u201d which limits the block rewards for the first 20,000 blocks (roughly 34 days). During that time, the block reward will gradually increase from 0 ZEC to 12.5 ZEC.\nTypically, when a coin first launches, mining difficulty is at its lowest and rises over a few days or weeks. A slow start discourage the big outfits from dedicating all their resources to mining in the beginning.\n\u201cWith the \u2018slow start\u2019 approach, we can pull the trigger to start mining, knowing that we still have a few weeks before it gets to be significantly valuable, giving us time to watch for failures, work on related operational things (updating our web site, dealing with getting hacked and defaced and all that, collaborating with wallet makers, exchange operators, and other partners, touring the world to visit stadiums of screaming fans, etc.),\u201d Wilcox \u00a0wrote on GitHub back in March.\nBut some in the Zcash forum argue, in the case of Zcash, where there is so much buzz around the coin, major players may jump into the game right away, and the difficulty will soar beyond the reach of the average CPU within hours or days.\nTY13R (as he is known on the Zcash Slack channel), who has worked on the Zcash GPU miner, told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cWhen they publish the first block, a huge a amount of hashing power will move over to it. There could be hundreds of blocks mined on the first day.\u201d\nLike Bitcoin, the plan is to only produce 21M tokens with a halving every four years, where the reward is halved to control inflation. However, unlike Bitcoin, for the first four years, a full 20 percent of the Zcash mining reward will go to stakeholders in the Zcash Company. This is known as the \u201cFounders Reward.\u201d\nExchanges \u00a0and Wallets\nIf you\u2019re not up for mining, another option is to simply buy Zcash tokens. Coins will be sparse until there is enough in the supply system. But, said TY13R, \u201cIf there is money to be made, people will sell. It all depends on whether the miners are willing to give up their ZEC.\u201d\nSeveral exchanges \u2014 including Poloniex, Bittrex, HitBTC, and Kraken \u2014 have already announced support for Zcash.\nShapeshift has also said that its platform will support ZEC as soon as liquidity allows. Erik Voorhees, CEO of ShapeShift, said to Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cJust as we should expect privacy in our emails, telephone calls and personal relationships, so too is privacy warranted in financial transactions. In our age of surveillance, the individual deserves every tool of empowerment, and Zcash has the potential to uphold this principle.\u201d\nAlong with Trezor wallets by SatoshiLabs, Jaxx has revealed it will integrate Zcash a few days after the launch, making Zcash the fifth token Jaxx has added to its lineup in less than three months.\n\u201cVCs have invested in Zcash, there\u2019s cutting edge security technology behind it and that\u2019s resulted in quite a lot of chatter in the crypto community,\u201d said Jaxx CEO Anthony Di Iorio. \u201cZcash holds an extraordinary amount of promise.\u201d\nThe Case for Zcash\nAs of this writing,\u00a0the price of Zcash futures\u00a0is hovering between 1.2 and 1.4 bitcoin ($820- $950) on BitMEX. If those numbers are any indication, Zcash could well become the second highest valued digital currency on record behind Bitcoin.\nZcash represents the hope for a perfectly untraceable digital currency. Although\u00a0progress is being made, at this point, Bitcoin transactions are traceable. This lack of fungibility, the idea that one bitcoin may not be as valuable as another, based on how it has been used in the past, has long been a threat to Bitcoin\u2019s livelihood. \u00a0\n\u201cYou need fungibility for Bitcoin to function. If you receive coins and can't spend them, then you start to doubt whether you can spend them,\u201d Blockstream CEO Adam Back told the audience at the Scaling Bitcoin conference in Milan.\nThe hope is that Zcash finally solves that problem, using the established cryptographic protocol, zk-Snarks. The basic idea is that when you make a transaction, you give a proof that says you have access to a certain amount of funds, but that proof gives zero knowledge to other people about what those funds are. (That is the \"zk\" part). The \"SNARK\" part is that Zcash can do this fairly efficiently now, especially compared to ZeroCoin, its precursor.\nBut Wilcox\u2019s own words capture the aspirations of Zcash the best. In an earlier interview with Bitcoin Magazine, he said:\n\u201cThe dream is that people all around the world use Zcash and other cryptocurrencies directly, to cooperate and organize with one another in safety and privacy. This will give them freedom from corrupt regimes, banks and unstable national currencies.\u201d\nWhether or not Zcash lives up to this dream, only time will tell. As it states on its website, Zcash still considers itself \u201can experimental technology\u201d and cautions, \u201cthere is risk involved.\u201d But for many people who wish they had jumped into Bitcoin earlier, those cautions may go unheard.", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 28}

With demand for talent outstripping supply, many companies are having to dial back blockchain related projects that are poised and strategically positioned for a rapid market launch.\nIn his book The Business Blockchain, thought leader and author, William Mougayar, briefly explores this emerging trend, noting that by his mid-2016 estimates, there were only \u201c5,000 developers dedicated to writing software for cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, or blockchain in general.\u201d He admits that \u201cperhaps another 20,000 had dabbled with the technology, or have written front end applications that connect with the blockchain.\u201d\nAll of this, he says, pales in comparison with the nine million Java developers worldwide, and about 18.5 million software developers in the world. But as the book documents, there is a silver lining of good news, namely, the blockchain\u2019s good fortune of being tied to languages and scripts that are already in popular use \u2014 like Java, Javascript, C++, Node.js, Python, Golang and Haskell.\nSays Mougayar, \u201cGetting more developers proficient on Blockchain technology is key, and part of its successful evolution. We can't avoid not having a critical mass of knowledgeable software engineers that know how to program blockchains and develop blockchain applications. Whereas it might take a few weeks of effort today to get a seasoned developer up to speed on blockchains, it might eventually take only two days.\u201d\nMougayar believes that efforts to address the prevailing blockchain developer shortage can be impacted by the following:\n- More general mass awareness about the blockchain;\n- Popularity of certification programs, such as from the CryptoCurrency Certification Consortium;\n- Formal education programs specializing in this field, such as the Master of Science in Digital Currency, University of Nicosia\u00a0in Cyprus. \u00a0\nSteven Nerayoff, Founder and CEO of Maple Ventures, a Venture Capital firm primarily focused on emerging blockchain-based technologies and payment systems, says the blockchain developer shortage is quite evident among many early stage companies he interacts with. \u201cIf you take high level programmers and cryptographers, like Gavin Wood, or someone who works for DARPA or NSA out of the equation, you\u2019re now talking about only a few hundred people that truly understand this blockchain development at a foundational level. That\u2019s such a small group of people for a technology niche that could significantly change how people organize and live their lives.\u201d \u00a0\nNerayoff goes on to say that this talent shortage is such that there are more projects in the blockchain space than people who are qualified to contribute. He does believe, though that this problem will slowly balance itself out as more and more qualified people migrate out of the government sector, and matriculate from colleges and universities.\nNerayoff says that the prevailing shortage will continue to be acute for those startups working on what he calls \u201cuninteresting projects.\u201d\n\u201cAs an advisor to Ethereum, I can personally tell you that people were fighting to get onboard there. They had no problems getting qualified programmers. The same with Lisk. They\u2019re a little younger than Ethereum, but as I\u2019m observing their hiring spree right now, there are lots of \u00a0people who are excited to go work there in large part because they\u2019re cultivating so many new ideas and fresh approaches. In my opinion, the best programmers always want to go to the most interesting projects, while others will continue to struggle to hire people.\u201d\nNako Mbelle, Founder and CEO of the Toronto-based Fintech Recruiters, sees the daily challenges businesses face in recruiting and retaining top (blockchain) developer talent. She says that Python developer shortages are particularly acute, and that her firm has also been receiving requests for functional developers in Haskell and Scala, two niche areas which she says are particularly hard to find. Erlang, Golang and Python are among the other most commonly requested skills. \u201cThese functional programming skills seem to be all the rage these days.\u201d\nAccording to Mbelle geographical demand is greatest in the U.S., particularly in New York City, followed by London and the UK. Strangely enough, she says, her firm is getting requests from as far away as Tokyo, Japan.\nSo what needs to take place in order to address these shortage concerns moving forward? Says Mbelle: \u201cCompanies and startups should offer more mentorship programs for developers who are just learning functional programming skills. There are simply not enough software developer internships available. Everyone wants someone with three to five years hands-on experience, yet they often won't give developers who are trying to cross-over into the fintech space a chance to prove themselves.\u201d\nMbelle continues: \u201cIn order to attract talent, startups should be flexible about remote working options. We're seeing a trend where startups want people in the office in order to build a corporate culture. However, the more experience a software developer has; the more likely they will want to work remotely, or have very flexible working environments.\u201d \u00a0\nWith respect to the long-term picture surrounding this talent shortage, she concludes: \u00a0\u201cI believe that more and more fintech companies will open up offices in Eastern Europe and Russia, because that seems to be where many developers are from and currently located. I think we'll also see more Functional Programming (training) bootcamps open up. And hopefully there will be more software developer mentoring and internship programs geared toward developers seeking to get into the space.\u201d\nAgentic Group LLC Is a global membership-driven consortium providing insight and consulting to corporations, non-profit organizations and government agencies seeking to understand and leverage emerging blockchain applications and digital currencies. Rik Willard, its founder and managing director, believes that the shortage is temporary. \u201cSure I think there is a shortage. But I think, as the space evolves, you\u2019re going to find that the numerous non-profits and other learning outlets that are teaching blockchain technologies will have an impact on this issue.\u201d\nWillard says that what the blockchain world is facing at present in terms of talent deficiencies is much like what took place during the early days of the web. \u201cThere weren\u2019t that many developers on the web in the early days. So various schools, academies, and groups got involved and began minting qualification certificates for the internet, ultimately leading to a massive influx of skilled programmers.\u201d\nShidan Gouran is an angel investor with several blockchain startups and innovative tech firms, as well as the organizer of the Blockchain Event, a North American conference series. Gouran says that he doesn\u2019t subscribe to the notion of a programmer shortage. \u201cI hear people say that but in my experience there are lots of talented developers out there who are not involved with the blockchain space because it, frankly, isn\u2019t important enough for them to be involved with.\u201d \u00a0\nHe notes that there is nothing inherently more difficult about blockchain than there is with any other type of development. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a cryptography wizard to understand how to develop a blockchain; you just have to know how to use cryptographic protocols. That\u2019s something that people have been doing forever.\u201d \u00a0\nHe says that the blockchain value proposition needs to make more commercial sense in order to get more programmers and developers involved. \u201cMore than anything, I think there is a shortage of good ideas. If a startup has a project that\u2019s interesting and can really impact commerce and lives, then qualified people will sign on to start working on it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve often said that we need fewer white papers and more code,\u201d said Gouran. \u201cWe need people who are starting projects and actually seeing them through rather than just doing crowd sales, raising money and kind of squandering it away, which we\u2019re seeing a lot of nowadays. Ultimately that\u2019s what I believe will attract top talent to this space.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 31}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin Core 0.13.1 was\u00a0released last week, which means miner signaling on the proposed\u00a0Segregated\u00a0Witness (SegWit) soft fork will start soon. If activated, SegWit offers a number of benefits, one of which is an effective block size limit increase to about 1.6 to 2 megabytes, depending on the types of transactions included in blocks.\nIf and when Segregated Witness is activated on the Bitcoin network, users will be able to take advantage of the added network capacity immediately \u2014 if their wallets are \u201cSegWit-ready.\u201d For users to enjoy this added block space, therefore, much will depend on Bitcoin wallet providers.\nOn\u00a0GitHub,\u00a025 wallets have indicated they will integrate SegWit. To poll their progress, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to a selection of them.\nState of Readiness\nDepending on miner signaling, Segregated Witness may, at the very soonest, be \u201clive\u201d on the Bitcoin network halfway through December. This somewhat unlikely best-case scenario leaves about six weeks for Bitcoin wallets to update their software.\nThe wallet providers that Bitcoin Magazine reached out to generally expected this should be sufficient time. Several of them are even ready to go already, or are in the final stages of development.\nGreenAddress, the wallet provider that was recently acquired by infrastructure development company\u00a0Blockstream, was among the first wallets to have completed Segregated Witness support, as early as February this year.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, developer Lawrence Nahum said that GreenAddress users will be able to receive and send SegWit transactions as soon as the soft fork is deployed on the Bitcoin network. After that, he plans to improve the wallet, further utilizing the possibilities offered by Segregated Witness, such as\u00a0MAST,\u00a0Schnorr signatures, and\u00a0the\u00a0Lightning\u00a0Network.\n\u201cI am very eager to make use of all good things in SegWit,\u201d Nahum said. \u201cI see it as a great stepping stone towards better fungibility and privacy, which I think are as important as \u2014 if not more important than \u2014 capacity increases.\u201d\nRegarding SegWit readiness itself, Nahum added:\n\u201cIntegration was quite easy. Desktop, iOS, and Android: All our wallets\u2019 GitHub master branches support SegWit already, and recently we finalised some integration testing with hardware wallets such as Ledger to make sure it all works.\u201d\nMost of the other wallet providers contacted by Bitcoin Magazine also indicated they should be SegWit-ready if and when the soft fork activates, or not too long after. Ciphrex's mSigna\u00a0wallet and the Ledger hardware wallet have fully integrated Segregated Witness.\u00a0BTC.com \u2014 formerly known as\u00a0Blocktrail \u2014 has been experiencing some delays due to the recent acquisition by ASIC-manufacturor\u00a0Bitmain, but said that integration shouldn\u2019t take much longer than several weeks.\u00a0Electrum, the popular desktop and Android wallet, will include Segregated Witness support in the next major release, planned before the end of the year. BreadWallet, a wallet app available on Android and iOS, is in the testing stage, and will offer SegWit to users once it\u2019s activated and deemed absolutely secure. And Mycelium, also available on iOS and Android, said it wrapped up the complicated part of integration, with only some user interface questions remaining.\nPayment processor BitPay confirmed its intention to integrate SegWit as well for its Copay wallet and the new\u00a0BitPay wallet, but the company is taking a slightly more conservative approach. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, BitPay CEO Stephen Pair explained that they will only start integration once it is more certain that the soft fork will actually activate.\n\u201cWe do plan to support SegWit. The timeline for that support will be driven by the activation of the required soft fork,\u201d Pair said, \u201cbut we don't know exactly when the activation will occur, so we don't want to spend time now only to have it take another six months or a year before activation happens.\u201d\nIncreased Complexity\nIn order to be able to deploy Segregated Witness as a soft fork, the Bitcoin Core developers opted to place a reference to signature data in a somewhat odd part of Bitcoin blocks. Although this does not make the solution insecure, it does add some complexity to Bitcoin\u2019s code-base, but the added effort for the wallet providers is not extreme.\nMost of the complexity is \u201chidden inside\u201d the open-source software libraries many wallets rely on. Several of these libraries have already integrated Segregated Witness support, and others should be able to include it within a few weeks.\nRuben de Vries is a developer for\u00a0BTC.com, and one of the maintainers of the bitcoinjs JavaScript library. At BTC.com he also works with Thomas Kerin, lead maintainer of the Bitcoin-php library. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, de Vries said:\n\u201cBitcoin-php has been ready for months. Bitcoinjs is pending review and some discussion because there are some backwards compatibility breaks. We could have it ready as soon as next week, though. For wallets, the change is very minor, technically. Looking purely at transaction building and signing, SegWit adds a bit of complexity, but not that much. Really, only full-node developers and projects have to bear with the full complexity.\u201d\nAs a general sentiment, wallet developers seemed to agree that the Segregated Witness solution is somewhat \u201chacky\u201d \u2014 but worth it. \u201cI consider SegWit to be \u2018Bitcoin 1.0;\u2019 it's fixing a couple of issues that are like \u2018beta bugs,\u2019\u201d de Vries said.\nFor Mycelium, Daniel Weigl has done most of the SegWit integration:\n\u201cWhen \u2014 in a SegWit world \u2014 a new developer learns about Bitcoin and how things work, he or she will stumble over a lot of strange things that will not be self-explanatory without knowing what transactions and blocks looked like before SegWit,\u201d Weigl said. \u201cThat adds barriers to entry in an already complicated topic. But I\u2019m no friend of hard forks either, so I also would not know how we could solve that without those quirks.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 31}
{"title": "Op-Ed: How Blockchain Technology Can Revolutionize E-Democracy", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-how-blockchain-technology-can-revolutionize-e-democracy-1478292668/", "birthday": "Nov 4, 2016  4:51 PM EST", "date": "2016-11-04 21:51:00", "content": "Our democratic systems of today were designed hundreds of years ago, in a time when letters were drafted in quill and ink, and then sent hundreds of miles over horseback to be shared between individuals. Governing institutions required closed-door offices in order to handle and organize the massive number of documents required by their agencies. This data module made sense because it was the most efficient option afforded to that particular era.\nWith the advent of the internet, the ability to share information has changed so fundamentally that it is hardly comparable to the methods used during the eighteenth century. This decisive evolution of human communications has begun to shape our conception of government as well. E-democracy, also known as digital democracy, is the term drafted to describe the influence that communication technologies are having on democratic governments. Some examples of digital democracy are electronic voting and online government services.\nHowever, the model of governance we use today is still all too similar to the ones used hundreds of years ago. Though information has gone from a written substrate to a digital one, and the speed at which information is shared has increased exponentially, the general relationship between the government and the public is the same. Information is stored in centralized databases that citizens can query for information. A trust relationship between citizenry and the government exists at the core of this model, as it did hundreds of years ago. Blockchain technology finally introduces the ability to replace trust in government offices with trust in a protocol based upon the impartiality of mathematics and cryptography. The immediate benefits of using distributed, and not centralized, systems in government are efficiency, integrity and security; the long term benefits are a more involved and empowered citizenry.\nBlockchain technologies stem from the digital currency bitcoin, which was originally designed to cut out middleman financial institutions (banks and credit companies) charged with maintaining financial transaction ledgers. Blockchains natural environment is financial, which is why blockchain tech\u2019s largest impacts are within the financial world. The Bank of England has even dubbed blockchain technology to potentially be the \u201cinternet of finance.\u201d\nThough the majority of new financial blockchain projects are being led for private sector businesses, public sector finance is also beginning to experience ripples of the blockchain revolution. For example, the U.K. Department for Work and Pensions is trialing blockchain tech for use in tracking and distributing welfare and pensions. Another project in the Republic of Georgia is piloting a blockchain-based land registry. Chief executive Valery Vavilov of BitFury, the company heading the project, explains the concept as an incorruptible yet transparent notary service that would allow for real-time audits \u201cnot once per year, but every 10 minutes.\u201d\nThese exact characteristics could potentially advance the realm of taxes as well, which is why U.K.-based organization DigitalCatapult, a catapult center meant to innovate the digital economy, is entertaining discussions on the topic. Moving tax information and accounting records onto a public blockchain system would inherently provide \u201cmore useful information and more certainty\u201d to everyone with a stake in a nation \u2014 not just tax agencies, but also citizens, business tycoons and government officials alike. By storing a nation\u2019s wealth on a public blockchain, real-time data could be used to increase organizational efficiency and cut down on waste within large organizations (which governments are) where inefficiency and disarray are endemic.\nOpacity within government fiscal policy also distances the citizenry, discouraging citizens from researching matters and forming opinions. The increased visibility and inherently uncompromising transparency of blockchain-based systems would help make government budgets and spending more clear, thus lessening the barrier between government and the citizenry, and ultimately encouraging more involvement in democratic processes.\nThe characteristics which make blockchain technology incredibly valuable extend beyond the realm of finances and the tracking of assets. For example, democratic countries could benefit by using the ability to track transfers of value on a public yet incorruptible ledger system to fundamentally change election processes.\nCurrently, democratic countries around the globe use implementations of the secret ballot system. Despite small nuances of difference in the electoral processes of the world\u2019s diverse democratic countries, the fundamental concept is universally the same: voters go to polling stations and cast anonymous paper ballots into a ballot box. The votes are later counted and added to the final tally of votes from different polling stations around the nation.\nThough different forms of electronic voting are used around the world, the functions and results are nearly identical, albeit simply more efficient, than physical ballot voting. Ballots go into a black box, and election results come out. This method has advantages, but it has drawbacks as well. This system is based on a trust relationship with the third party or government collecting and counting ballots, meaning common citizens have absolutely no way to guarantee that their votes were counted correctly, or that no election fraud was carried out behind the scenes. It\u2019s no wonder voters have little faith in the system and that countries suffer from low voter turnout and a politically apathetic populace. \u00a0\nBlockchain solutions for the problem of centralized elections have been proposed by the Follow My Vote project, which has designed open source election software based on blockchain technology. The system would represent transfers of value on the blockchain not as currency, but as a voter\u2019s ballot. The transparency of the system would not only allow voters to verify that their individual votes were counted correctly, but also allow citizens to conduct an independent \u201caudit [of] the ballot box\u201d by scanning the blockchain where all votes are cast. The system would also sport strong security against both external cyber attacks and internal election fraud through the immutable and distributed ledger.\nFinally, the concept of DAOs brought to us by digital currencies has allowed us to reimagine the way we organize ourselves. A DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a distributed organization governed by distributed consensus and \u201csmart contracts\u201d \u2014 essentially programming logic executing and enforcing rules depending on the fulfillment of conditions. The first DAO was Bitcoin, \u201cgoverned by consensus among its core team and its mining network,\u201d with other DAOs now being launched over Ethereum to govern real-world businesses. Smart contracts essentially govern the DAO, with stakeholders democratically voting on issues across the decentralized blockchain network. The concept of the DAO has allowed us to reimagine human organizations, bringing what Ethereum calls \u201cdemocracy on the blockchain.\u201d\nWhen our democratic governments were originally created, the ability to communicate instantaneously with the entire world was an unimaginable fantasy. So our predecessors designed systems of representative government, which were the most efficient solution to the problem of representing millions of people in the human organization that is a nation. However, as technology changes, so do our societies. Just as society was fundamentally changed by electricity and the printing press, so too could the combined inventions of the internet and the blockchain fundamentally change our modern society and democratic institutions.\nPerhaps, someday in the future, our centralized parliaments and representative institutions will be replaced with a concept similar to a DAO, so that all citizens with a stake in the nation will be empowered with objectively equal political power. Armed with the power of distributed communication technologies and governed by consensus on a blockchain, our descendants could directly represent themselves with their own voices in the purest form of democracy ever attained \u2014 a distributed, digital democracy.", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 4}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin Core\u00a0launched its latest software release last week, which includes a proposed\u00a0Segregated\u00a0Witness soft fork. If a majority of miners signal support for the proposal, Segregated Witness will activate on the Bitcoin network \u2014 perhaps as soon as December. This would offer several benefits, including an effective block size limit increase, a malleability fix and more.\nA lesser known benefit is that input amounts of transactions \u00a0\u2014 the amount of bitcoins being sent \u00a0\u2014 will for the first time be cryptographically signed by users: a small change, but according to\u00a0Ledger CTO Nicolas Bacca, \u201cthis fixes one of the biggest issues hardware wallets are faced with today.\u201d\nInput amounts\nAll Bitcoin transactions send bitcoins from \u201cinputs\u201d to \u201coutputs,\u201d where inputs specify from which Bitcoin-addresses bitcoins are sent, and outputs refer to receiving addresses.\nNaturally, all inputs must contain at least as many bitcoins as all outputs. A sender can\u2019t create bitcoins out of thin air.\nIn fact, however, inputs typically contain slightly more bitcoins than the outputs. That difference is the mining fee. So if all inputs are worth one BTC, and all outputs are worth 0.999 BTC, whomever mines the transaction can attribute himself the remaining 0.001 BTC.\nBut currently there\u2019s an odd quirk. While outputs specifically contain explicit amounts, inputs do not. That\u2019s not really a problem, because each input relies on a previous transaction. Bitcoin wallets can therefore look up how much a specific input contains by checking the blockchain.\nThe exception is hardware wallets, Bacca explained to Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cHardware wallets don\u2019t store the entire blockchain, nor do they have access to the Bitcoin network directly. Instead, to collect the transaction history, they connect to software that does. They connect to the Bitcoin network through wallets running on desktop computers, for instance. Or web-wallets.\u201d\nIn many ways, this is not a problem. The hardware wallet generates a transaction, spending a certain amount of bitcoins to certain addresses. Only if the user really wants to send this amount of bitcoins to these addresses, will he sign the transaction. There is no risk of sending too many funds to the outputs.\nBut this still leaves open the risk of a \u201cfee attack,\u201d Bitcoin Core and\u00a0Digital Bitbox developer, Jonas Schnelli, told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cAs a simple example, let\u2019s say your computer is compromised by a Trojan horse. When sending funds from your hardware wallet, this Trojan horse increases the input amounts, or adds extra inputs, without revealing this to the user. Through the hardware wallet, the user then confirms that the outputs check out, as do the output amounts, and signs the transaction. Little does he know, the inputs contained much more bitcoins than needed for the transactions; perhaps even all bitcoins stored on the hardware wallet. All these bitcoins are then all attributed to the miner, as a huge fee.\u201d\nWhile perhaps unlikely, this risk defeats an important purpose of hardware wallets. After all, the idea is that these devices cannot be hacked into, even if used in combination with an insecure computer.\nSegregated Witness\nA countermeasure to this \u201cfee attack\u201d does exist. Hardware wallets can fetch a previous transaction from the blockchain through the software it connects to, hash the output amounts, and compare this with hashes of the input amounts of the new transaction.\nBut,\u00a0Trezor architect Marek \u201cSlush\u201d Palatinus explained, \u201cthese solutions are crazy complex and slow.\u201d And due to limited computational resources in hardware wallets, in some cases they are not even viable. \u201cTransactions that include lots of inputs or outputs, like payouts from mining pools or faucets, can take up to one hour to calculate,\u201d Palatinus said.\nSegregated Witness offers a better solution.\nSegregated Witness moves the cryptographic signatures to a sort of \u201cadd-on\u201d part of a transaction: the \u201cWitness.\u201d This in itself is not important for hardware wallets. But as the signature data is being moved anyway, changing how wallets read them, Bitcoin Core developers decided to slightly change how the signatures are generated as well.\nSpecifically, the input amounts \u2014 while still not part of the transaction itself \u2014 are signed. In a way, these input amounts become \u201cpart of\u201d the cryptographic signature. As such, a hardware wallet user will only sign for specific amounts of bitcoins to be sent \u2014 with no need to go through a complex and slow process, and with no risk of sending too many funds. (If a Trojan horse would try to change the input amount after it is signed, the transaction would be considered invalid by Bitcoin nodes.)\nIf Segregated Witness is activated, it would be relatively easy to upgrade all existing hardware wallets to utilize this option. Ledger has already updated Ledger\u2019s code-base, while Trezor and Digital Bitbox integration should be ready if and when the soft fork activates.\n\u201cSegregated Witness is not just about scaling,\u201d Palatinus emphasized. \u201cThere are other issues with Bitcoin under the hood, and SegWit opens potential for applications and use-cases that are not possible today. For those who think only bigger blocks will save bitcoin\u2019s exchange rate, and for miners who are going to decide on whether or not they should adopt SegWit, this is important to understand.\u201d\nFor a more detailed technical explanation, see\u00a0this article by Ledger\u2019s Nicolas Bacca.", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 2}

That marks a year-to-date increase of around 60 percent at today\u2019s price, which seems to be settling down a bit at around $690 - $700 per bitcoin. Bitcoin\u2019s price surge should not come as a big surprise given that 2016 has been an excellent year for the currency, and even more so for its underlying blockchain technology.\nBlockchain distributed ledger technology is finally gaining widespread adoption for an array of different purposes. The use of the blockchain is currently being implemented to reduce operational costs in the financial services sector, record land ownership, fight digital content piracy, develop smart contracts, prove physical asset ownership and reduce cross-border payment costs, among other uses. While there have been many skeptics when it comes to bitcoin as a currency, the blockchain is poised to become the game-changing technology that bitcoin enthusiasts once predicted it will be.\nHaving said that, it is not only the blockchain that has been gaining in popularity and acceptance. In 2016, bitcoin adoption has shot up globally, according to\u00a0data collected by Coin Dance. Most notably, it has increased heavily in nations that have experienced political or economic distress in 2016, such as Turkey, Ukraine, Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia.\nNews regarding Bitcoin regulation, which has been a key factor affecting the price of the currency, has been largely positive throughout the year. Russia has softened its stance on bitcoin, while China has hosted a major blockchain conference and South Africa has given the green light for Bitcoin startups to blossom.\nIn late October, the price of bitcoin surpassed the $700 mark for the first time since June and began climbing toward a new annual high, continuing its steady price increase \u2014 only interrupted in the summer months by the Bitcoin halving and the Bitfinex exchange hack.\nHere are a few potential reasons why the price of bitcoin has surged in 2016 and why it will likely continue to move north in the coming months.\nPositive Bitcoin News in the Headlines\nNot a week goes by where there isn\u2019t an announcement of a new startup disrupting another industry using blockchain technology. From the financial industry to the music industry and the art market, it almost seems as if blockchain applications are endless. These headlines have put bitcoin in a positive light and have helped to improve the digital currency\u2019s tainted image, which has also likely aided in the recent price improvement.\nBitcoin Scalability\nAnother driver behind the positive bitcoin price trend is the scaling of Bitcoin. On October 27,\u00a0Bitcoin Core version 0.13.1. was launched, which introduced\u00a0Segregated Witness. Segregated Witness (SegWit) is a proposed soft fork of the Bitcoin protocol that aims to solve issues around scalability of the Bitcoin network. The proposed update to the Bitcoin network includes making programming more flexible, a malleability fix and a block size limit increase to about 1.6 to 2 megabytes, depending on the type of transaction, among several other improvements.\nThis proposed fix for the heavily debated Bitcoin scalability issue has likely been another underlying driver of bitcoin\u2019s recent price movement, although it remains to be seen whether the SegWit soft fork will be implemented by the bitcoin mining community.\nChina\u2019s Weakening Currency Boosts Chinese Bitcoin Demand\nOne of the primary reasons cited behind increasing bitcoin demand coming out of China has been the weakening of its currency, the yuan renminbi (CNY). On October 17, the\u00a0People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) set its USD/CNY fixing rate at a 6-year low of 6.7379, which is a touch weaker than its previous fix of 6.7157.\nSince the beginning of 2016, the yuan has depreciated over 3.5 percent against the U.S. dollar. As China is a net exporter and the U.S. is one of its key trading partners, it is in China\u2019s best interest to keep its currency weak against the U.S. dollar. This, on the other hand, weakens the Chinese consumers purchasing power. Hence, a move from CNY into bitcoin makes sense, especially given this year\u2019s positive bitcoin price trend.\nGrowing Bitcoin Demand in India\nBitcoin adoption has increased substantially in India in the year 2016,\u00a0according to LocalBitcoins.com transaction data. The driving forces behind this increase have been the leading Indian bitcoin startups Coinsecure, Zebpay and Unocoin, which\u00a0recently raised $1.5 million in funding. Unocoin and Coinsecure are the two leading bitcoin exchanges in India, while Zebpay offers a bitcoin wallet that allows for in-app bitcoin purchases and money transfers via text message.\nIf bitcoin adoption increases in a highly populated country like India, this could lead to a serious jump in price in the future.\nIncreasing Incentive to Hold\nThe more the price of bitcoin increases, the more the propensity to hold bitcoin also increases. Given the historical price performance of bitcoin, it makes more sense to hold bitcoin as opposed to using it as a spending currency. Hence, it is no surprise that many bitcoin users prefer to hold rather than to spend the digital currency. This creates a scenario where the demand increases but the supply stays somewhat stagnant.\nPrediction\nBitcoin\u2019s recent rally was dampened on November 3, when it was announced that\u00a0Chinese authorities are considering imposing capital controls on bitcoin. Chinese traders have a massive impact on the price of bitcoin. Hence, this news led to a substantial price drop of around 10 percent within hours of the headline hitting news outlets. However, the price quickly recovered back above the $700 mark as the rumor was not substantiated.\nShocks to the price of bitcoin will continue to happen, as exchanges and companies suffer cyber attacks, regulators impose new laws on Bitcoin and negative headlines about scams or other digital currency-related criminal activities hit the international news wires.\nHowever, as the overall sentiment toward bitcoin continues to improve, VC funding for Bitcoin companies increases further and global bitcoin adoption continues to rise, it is easy to be optimistic about the future of bitcoin\u2019s price development.", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 4}

Today, the country hosts some of the industry's top players \u2014 including Bitmain, the world's largest bitcoin-mining machine manufacturer, and top exchange platforms OKCoin and Huobi.\nShenzhen-based BitKan offers Bitcoin-related tools and services such as aggregated news, mining monitoring and price alerts.

Bitcoin and blockchain can benefit from balanced, risk-based regulation and/or oversight and given the opportunity to develop products and services with enormous consumer benefits.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s ambition is fueled by the Korean government\u2019s decision to institutionalize digital currencies and ramp up fintech development. In fact, in October Korea\u2019s Financial Services Commission (FSC) said they will institutionalize digital currencies such as bitcoin and ramp up the size of average annual policy finance from 500 billion won ($437 million) to one trillion won ($873 million) for the development of fintech.\n\u201cWe will take the lead in the convergence of new emerging technologies such as digital currencies and blockchains and financial service,\u201d said FSC Chairman Yim Jong-yong, adding that blockchain technology is emerging as the core infrastructure of future finance. The government plans to launch a joint blockchain consortium for the financial industry within the year. \u201cWe will create conditions to test fintech services without a burden of regulating them by introducing a financial regulation testbed system and review various regulations and practices against non-financial channels such as verification and user identification.\u201d\nThis initiative of the Korean government seems significant, and it\u2019s equally worth noting that the FSC signed a cooperation agreement with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), showing that two of the most dynamic economies on the planet are officially supporting the deployment of distributed ledger fintech.\n\u201cIn the past three years, governments have taken a diverse approach to foster digital currencies and blockchain technologies,\u201d said Byun. \u201cWe applaud the Financial Services Commission\u2019s vision and leadership, along with committing one trillion won for the development of fintech in Korea. We believe this will create conditions to test fintech services without a burden of regulating them, by introducing a financial regulation testbed system and reviewing various regulations.\u201d\n\u201cOKLink has developed a new and revolutionary way to solve problems in the traditional money transfer system,\u201d said Ian Suh, Founder and CEO of MOIN, one of the Korean companies in the new remittance network. \u201cThe partnership will enable Korean people to send money abroad cheaper, faster and more conveniently.

Ujo is now at proof of concept stage.\nRoughly six months ago, Grushack said, he and his colleagues began a series of \"deep dives into the music industry.\"\nWhen they came up for air, they realized that while it would be tough to remedy music industry problems that result from power-jockeying, regulatory and policy impediments, and other factors, they had at least one clean shot on goal: \"We realized we could remove the majority of the administrative burden behind a lot of this stuff, shorten the payments process, and make music more open and licensable.\"\nGrushack said he no longer thinks mainly of \"disrupting\" the music industry because he realizes \"a lot of times music labels still have an important role to play, as in artist management.\u201d\nEqually important, he said, is achieving \"a delicate balance while trying to simply shift the music industry,\" and awaken labels and others to ways blockchain infrastructure and tools can help them dramatically expand the numbers of artists they can reach internationally, and to sources of revenue beyond radio and television.\nVeterans of the U.S. industry, in particular, are likely to be galvanized when they experience how Bitcoin and blockchain allow them, for example, to reach out to other parties in Australia and \"absolutely trust their access,\" he added.\n\"All of this is still basically really young, and I think we really have a lot of learning and a lot of testing to see what really works in this space,\" he emphasized. As was true in the early days of the internet, he said, there are still many tools to be built.\nNonetheless, he said it\u2019s good to keep in mind that the Ethereum platform, upon which ConsenSys is builtis still very young, although its progress over the past 18 months has been fierce.\nThe steady flow of new offerings suggest blockchain-adoption momentum is growing in the music sector, he said, citing as an example the recent announcement of the Berlin-based blockchain-enabled collaborative called Resonate, a stream-to-own entry.\nMoreover, he said, it was just a year ago that the Ujo team employed its then-prototype platform to support U.K.-based singer-songwriter, Imogen Heap, in the release of her single, Tiny Humans, on the Ethereum blockchain. Users bought licenses to download, stream, remix and sync the song. Payments were automatically split on the blockchain and sent directly to all who collaborated with Heap.\nThrough its tech studio operation, ConsenSys builds decentralized applications and developer and end user components deemed essential for services and business models that are destined for the blockchain. In its venture role, the company aims to serve as a \u201chub\u201d organization. Its roadmap features 13 \u201cspoke\u201d pathways or domains, within which it creates, acquires, invests in and otherwise collaborates for development and advancement of related blockchain initiatives.\nConsenSys announced on November 1 that SingularDTV\u00a0has adopted its uPort application, which features a self-sovereign identity and key management system built on the Ethereum blockchain and includes a mobile app, Ethereum smart contracts and open source libraries.\nThe brand \"Ujo\" is derived from an Esperanto expression for \"container,\" and was chosen to suggest the infrastructure, assets and security of the blockchain-based offering, Grushack explained.\nBlokur\nA year ago, Bitcoin Magazine listed PeerTracks and Bittunes, as well as Ujo, as blockchain startups intent on enabling performing artists and others to have a freer hand in safeguarding and commercializing their assets, while speeding up payments to all who have rights to proceeds.That same story included comments from founding Ujo team member, Phil Barry, a legacy industry veteran who played an instrumental role in advancing Ujo Music to prototype, but then exited that team early this year.\nBarry subsequently established Blokur, headquartered in the London area.\nReached for comment today, Barry said Blokur remains generally in \u201cstealth\u201d mode and is not likely to be more visible until 2017. The Blokur domain was created in February, according to WhoIs.\nBarry explained he began working on the Blokur business in earnest a few months ago. He said his team includes legacy industry veterans and outside advisors. The advisors include, for example, a former Performing Rights Organization (PRO) executive, he confirmed.\n\u201cWe are working at the moment with some of the big music companies and big music services on pilot projects,\u201d he said.\nHe characterized his early work on Ujo as yielding \u201ca very useful tool to get feedback from the the music industry about what blockchain might look like\u201d in the music context.\nAsked his view of the legacy music industry\u2019s posture regarding blockchain adoption and new business and operating models, Barry said he sees \u201cgrowing appreciation that this technology could solve real problems in the music industry and that those problems are universally understood to be big enough to invest in\u201d to create remedies.\nBarry noted that many individuals within the legacy industry are personally very interested in blockchain, but are also extremely cautious not to associate publicly their employers\u2019 brands with their personal exploration of the matter.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that, at this stage, many people don't have a deep understanding of how blockchain technology works and how it will provide the value.\u201d So, he said, the job is to \u201cprove to them that it has value, rather than talking to them about blockchain technology, which, at the end of the day, is just a tool, just a technology.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 8}

Instead of fish, though, the startup is working with the Zimbabwe Women Farmers Accelerator and the\u00a0Women Farmers Land and Agriculture Trust, a small-scale farmers\u2019 trust, to give women farmers a jumpstart in agriculture.

As a result, the governments of Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe declared national emergencies.\nBitMari is attempting to alleviate food shortages, while getting the economy of Zimbabwe back on track, by working with farmers who can tend to the land as they undertake various projects with help from BitMari\u2019s funds.\nEach of the 10 women in the program will use their BitMari bitcoin wallets to receive bitcoin that will support each of their projects. While BitMari has stated that projects are still being finalized, Sinclair Skinner, CEO and Co-Founder of BitMari, told Bitcoin Magazine that the \u00a0variety of projects could include the cultivation of tomatoes, maize and chickens.\n\u201c[We are hoping to achieve] sustainable small-scale commercial farms that increase [the farmers\u2019] ability to acquire a direct investment,\u201d said Skinner.\nProviding a Cash Alternative in Bitcoin\nOne of the issues that the project faces is that while bitcoin is legal, it\u2019s not legal tender. This is despite the fact that Zimbabwe has often been described as uniquely suited to launching the digital currency, according to a white paper discussing whether bitcoin can make it in Africa, written by\u00a0Simbarashe Machiridza, a lawyer in Zimbabwe.\nUntil regulation arrives, bitcoin startups are aiming to boost acceptance of the currency and make it the remittance vehicle of choice for money transfers to and from Africa\u2019s diaspora.\n\u201cZimbabwe has a cash crisis where bitcoin can be used to settle remittance transactions without exposing anyone to the volatility of bitcoin,\u201d said Skinner.\nBy teaming up with the Zimbabwe Women Farmers Accelerator, the idea behind the program is to raise awareness and the advantages of bitcoin by educating communities that wouldn\u2019t necessarily use a digital currency, illustrating the benefits of it as a cash alternative.\n\u201c[We are] demonstrating the usefulness of bitcoin to decolonize African agricultural economies,\u201d said Skinner.", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 8}

Representing the beginning of the RSK Testnet Network, Turmeric is intended to allow developers to test their distributed applications and tools, and will be gradually opened to the public.\nDescribed by its creators as \u201cthe first open-source smart contract platform with a 2-way peg to Bitcoin that also rewards the Bitcoin miners via merged mining,\u201d RSK raised $1 million in funding from Bitmain Technologies, Coinsilium and the Digital Currency Group in March of 2016 to complete the development of its technical plans.\nTrezor hardware wallet architect, Marek \u201cSlush\u201d Palatinus, who also founded the world's first bitcoin mining pool, gave a strong statement of support for Rootstock in a tweet that was widely shared: \u201cImpressed by @RSKsmart development. I especially like it's not an altcoin, but they build on top of bitcoin. This may be a next big thing.\u201d\nLegendary cryptographer Nick Szabo retweeted with a comment: \u201cBest of Bitcoin (currency and settlement system) + best of Ethereum (smart contract programming environment).\u201d\nOne year ago, Sergio Demi\u00e1n Lerner, one of the founders of RSK, described RSK as an \"improved version of the Ethereum virtual machine as a Bitcoin sidechain.\"\nLerner is the author of the RSK whitepaper, last updated in December 2015. In the introduction, Lerner explains that RSK is a smart contract platform that adds a Turing Complete Virtual Machine \u2014 a \u201cworld computer\u201d \u2014 to Bitcoin. Additionally, RSK achieves 300 transactions per second and confirms most payments in less than 20 seconds, while leveraging Bitcoin's proof of work security.\nRSK is a Bitcoin Sidechain \u2014 a separate blockchain that carries a separate token but is able to exchange tokens back and forth with the main Bitcoin blockchain. Users can move bitcoin to the RSK chain, make use of the converted bitcoin, and then eventually move their tokens back, as bitcoin, to the main blockchain.\nTo put bitcoin back into the main Bitcoin blockchain, a RSK transaction fee has to be paid. There is no concept of mining for coin creation, since all coins come from the Bitcoin blockchain, but there is the all-important concept of merged mining: miners can run both blockchains and receive fees for validating bitcoin transactions as well as for running RSK contracts. It is expected that merged mining should provide sufficient incentives to miners.\n\u201cWe believe in Bitcoin,\u201d states the RSK website. \u201cThe lack of Turing-complete smart-contracts capabilities may become an obstacle to Bitcoin\u2019s growth to its full potential. RSK provides the missing technical needs, as a blockchain with a 2-way peg to Bitcoin. As RSK does not mint, nor has pre-mined coins, it has no speculative value and does not compete with Bitcoin.\u201d\nIn related news, Decentral, creators of the universal wallet Jaxx, announced the integration of RSK, described as \u201cSmart Bitcoin,\u201d into their suite of software products. \u201cJaxx becomes the first blockchain wallet to effect the integration, which will give users an opportunity to access the testnet version of the token, powered by smart contracts secured by the bitcoin network.\u201d\nThe announcement was made at laBITconf, held in Buenos Aires on November 4 and 5.\n\u201cRootstock\u2019s platform is a remarkable way to enhance the the efficiency of transactions and in turn, the entire bitcoin ecosystem,\u201d said Jaxx CEO Anthony Di Iorio in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen great interest in their project and we are big fans of the development team. Jaxx is thrilled to add the yellow label version of their coin on our wallets, and look forward to adding the main-net version in the coming months.\u201d\n\u201cRootstock is not new in that it inherits intellectual work from previous projects, but what is new, is the way we create economic incentives and the way we leverage on top of the bitcoin security model,\u201d added RSK Co-Founder, Diego Guti\u00e9rrez Zald\u00edvar. \u201cOur partnership with Jaxx is a landmark one for us, because they produce full featured, easy to use wallets on more platforms than anyone else.\u201d\n", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 9}

(tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBeijing-based Bitcoin ASIC hardware producer and mining giant,\u00a0Bitmain, announced on November 5 that it\u2019s in the process of building a major data center complex in the northwest of China. The company says the facility will be capable of consuming up to 135 megawatts of power and is set to become the\u00a0second largest data center in the world.\nAccording to a\u00a0press release published by Bitmain:\n\u201c[The facility] is specially designed for high-performance computing and, considering the interest of most investors in the data center, mining of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin will be its major application.\u201d\nXinjang: Cold, Dry Climate is Ideal\nThe data center is to be located near the city of Karamay in the northwestern province of Xinjiang, which is the largest Chinese administrative division in the country. According to Bitmain\u2019s international marketing manager, Nishant Sharma, Xinjang was chosen for its \u201cbitterly cold and dry climate,\u201d which is ideal for bitcoin mining, and for its access to government-supported, low-cost wind and solar electricity.\nAdditionally, Sharma noted:\u201cThe government is supportive of new technologies that can develop the region's economy and generate more employment opportunities.\u201d\nThe facility will consist of 45 dust-free buildings with advanced cooling systems. If these were to be filled completely with Bitmain\u2019s most advanced mining equipment \u2014 the\u00a0AntMiner S9 \u2014\u00a0calculations by\u00a0Bitcoin Core and\u00a0Blockstream developer, Matt Corallo, suggest the data center could theoretically produce over 1400 petahash per second, almost three-quarters of the estimated hash rate currently on the\u00a0Bitcoin network.\nThis upper-bound estimate seems unlikely to become reality, however. Sharma noted that Bitmain owns \u201ca very small share\u201d of the data center. The rest of the facility is owned by different investors.\n\u201cWe hope it will be used for various purposes that an efficient and powerful data center can be used for,\u201d Sharma told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe do not know what percentage of investors would use it for mining bitcoin, altcoin \u2014 or for even mining [at all]. Frankly, I wouldn't assume that the entire facility will be dedicated to bitcoin mining.\u201d\nBitmain could not disclose how many investors are involved with the project, nor could the company reveal any names.\nCentralization Concerns\nAs the announcement of the data center first circulated through social media, the news was not welcomed equally by everyone. For some, the mock-ups published by Bitmain serve as a stark reminder of the degree of mining centralization that has developed over the past years;\u00a0well over half of all hash power on the Bitcoin network is currently controlled by less than half a dozen Chinese mining pools. With the establishment of the data center, an increasing share of hash power could become more geographically centralized within the country as well.The announcement prompted Bitcoin Core developer,\u00a0Peter\u00a0Todd, and Vice Chairman of\u00a0The BitFury Group,\u00a0George Kikvadze, to voice concern that the data-center could represent a potential target for adversarial forces or governments. Bitmain refrained from commenting on this issue.The company did note that designs for the facility will be made \u201copen source\u201d after the data center is built. This could help other bitcoin miners achieve a similar level of efficiency, Sharma explained to Bitcoin Magazine.\u201cWe will release the plans or other details that make this data center as effective as it is planned to be. We have gathered this knowledge from operating data centers for bitcoin mining on a very large scale and in various locations. We will release these details so everyone can use our knowledge to build similarly efficient data centers for bitcoin or altcoin mining.\u201dBitmain\u2019s facility is currently under construction. It was originally planned to be completed in about a month from now, but the unexpectedly cold winter in Xinjiang has delayed the process. Bitmain does estimate that the facility will be completed by end of this year.", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 10}

That hostility has subsided in some quarters, cracking open doors for serious discussion that could lead to fresh alliances, he said.\nSingularDTV has been approached by studios and others, and LeBeau expects to be \u201cannouncing partnerships in the film industry...a year from now, late 2017, when we are closer to beta phase.\u201d\nHe cautioned that even while more industry executives are \"open to the possibility\" of introducing blockchain and smart contracts technology, wariness regarding the scale and speed of decentralization remains a factor in many discussions.\nSuch openings will widen in due course, he said, largely because the prospect of rising demand from artists, consumers and others will drive decentralization and \"compel\" current industry components to join in the shift. \"Film and TV deals are among some of the most complicated [transactions] in the world. You have hundreds, sometimes thousands of transactional participants in a single movie,\" he emphasized.\nLeBeau said there's long been awareness of the need to leverage key parts of existing industry, as well as the reality that, in order to achieve a broad, fair and balanced ecosystem, \"ultimately, we've got to do it, together.\"\nIndeed, selective partnering is an important ingredient in funding the growth and maturation of both SingularDTV and the overall ecosystem, he said.\nThanks to initial founder funding, partnerships and the $7.5 million equivalent raised through its SNGLS initial coin offering in early October, LeBeau said he's confident the company has the runway it needs to \"challenge and or disintermediate the largest entertainment platforms within five to 10 years.\" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"To challenge the Netflixs of the world, we need to add tremendous value to our platform and make the appropriate strategic partnerships to take us to that next level,\" he emphasized.\nSNGLS are tokens that each represent a claim on SingularDTV's decentralized intellectual property (IP), including documentaries and other films, TV-series episodes, software and other assets. Documentary topics may include the decentralization theme, blockchain and the emergence of Ethereum.\nAs the demonstrable value of SingularDTV assets rise, that rise could be reflected in the value of SNGLS. LeBeau said this asset-based value is intended to sharply differentiate SNGLS from token valuations that are not associated with utility, but have large speculative components.\nSingularDTV's engagement with the legacy entertainment industry is likely to expand as SingularDTV arrives at beta-stage, which is projected for 2H 2017, he added.\nUntil beta arrives, SingularDTV plans to demonstrate using only its proprietary content, including documentaries, a Sci-Fi series and other assets. It's in talks about including a film from an outside studio during the beta phase. That would represent a novel decentralization of film distribution by the studio in question.\nAs reported by Bitcoin Magazine two months ago, LeBeau and SingularDTV CTO, Joseph Lubin, said they believe their blockchain-based digital content- and rights-management platform, with its SNGLS local digital currency, will quickly enable artists, filmmakers, performers and other content creators to monetize their works, independent of Netflix, YouTube and other intermediaries.\nIn LeBeau's view, artists will at that point have an alternative to \"the monopolistic and obfuscated distribution machine of the legacy entertainment industry.\u201d\nLeBeau also said that he prefers not to think of SingularDTV's goal as a matter of \"competing\" with actors within the status quo \u2014 whether Hollywood or Bollywood. Rather, his goal is to offer consumers and other users \"an alternative experience\" that is decentralized, transparent and peer-to-peer, providing overall \"a user experience that the internet presently cannot.\"\nIn a November 1 press release, SingularDTV announced its adoption of ConsenSys Systems' uPort application, which affords access to a self-sovereign identity and key management system built on the Ethereum blockchain.\nLeBeau said that while decentralized user identity afforded by blockchain is a vital part of the user experience in music, entertainment and other sectors, legacy industry executives who do not yet understand blockchain typically do not grasp the importance associated with an artist being able to build her brand globally and persistently.\nThis lack of understanding results partly from the fact that the users worldwide are more accustomed to the way identity is controlled on the internet by entities such as Facebook and Twitter, according to a recent SingularDTV statement.\nOn SingularDTV, both audience and content producers control and own their respective identities, which remain uniform throughout Ethereum.\nIn contrast, SingularDTV observed, an internet merchant on Amazon \u201cwho has been selling products for several years and has built a reputation based on a collection of reviews and ratings is not able to take that same identity history to eBay if they want to begin selling there. Instead, they need to build their identity and reputation from the beginning.\u201d\nAs previously reported by Bitcoin Magazine, uPort won the Blockchain Summit Demo Day competition in September, in Shanghai.", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 8}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe\u00a0Scaling Bitcoin conference, held at the\u00a0Politecnico Milan, returned for its third iteration this weekend, with the focus throughout the speaking slots and workshops shifting away from scaling alone. Emphasizing that Bitcoin faces a more diverse set of challenges, this year\u2019s edition of the technical conference included a broad range of topics. Chief among them was fungibility \u2014 the idea that each bitcoin should be as valuable as any other bitcoin, regardless of transaction history.\nThe tone for this third Scaling Bitcoin edition was set with the workshop\u2019s first overview presentation by program chair and\u00a0Blockstream developer Matt Corallo, and newly appointed Blockstream CEO Dr. Adam Back.\n\u201cIf there are doubts about coins you receive, then people are going to go to taint services and check whether these coins are \u2018blessed,\u2019\u201d Back explained. \u201cAnd [if not], then people are going to refuse to trade them. What this does is it transitions bitcoin from a decentralized permissionless system into a centralized permissioned system where you have an \u2018IOU\u2019 from the blacklist providers.\u201d\nFollowing up on Corallo and Back\u2019s opening presentation, the first half of the first conference day focused on fungibility exclusively. Speakers presented proposals that included JoinMarket, a marketplace for\u00a0CoinJoin transactions to aggregate several transactions into one bigger transaction, and TumbleBit, a trustless mixing service.\nA dedicated workshop continued the discussion that same afternoon. Fungibility remained on top of everyone\u2019s mind throughout the weekend \u2014 optimistically \u2014 with topics including\u00a0Schnorr signatures to incentivize CoinJoin transactions, coin-selection schemes for improved privacy, and\u00a0BIP 151 for end-to-end encryption.\n\u201cMost of the [scalability improvements] have not been implemented or don't have heavy use,\u201d said Corallo in the conclusion of his opening talk. \u201cBut we do know how to fix Bitcoin and make it act like what we want it to be, rather than the traceable asset it acts like today.\u201d\nLightning Scaling\nOn the subject of scaling itself, the technical community seemed to broadly agree that optimizations and second-layer solutions are the preferred way forward for now. While segments of the Bitcoin community are still dedicated to increasing transaction throughput by increasing the block size limit \u2014 with some of them gathering at an alternative event on Saturday night \u2014 the Scaling Bitcoin workshops predominantly focused on alternative solutions.\nThe\u00a0lightning\u00a0network in particular claimed a significant chunk of presentation slots. Through clever use of Bitcoin\u2019s programmable elements such as multi-signature and time locks, lightning users should be able to make a virtually unlimited number of off-chain transactions at low cost, potentially boosting Bitcoin\u2019s micropayment ability and overall scalability. Given that most lightning transactions wouldn\u2019t be recorded on the blockchain at all, it could offer other benefits, too.\n\u201cWe're excited about lightning because the second layer could be an important opportunity to improve privacy and fungibility,\u201d Lightning Labs\u2019 Olaoluwa Osuntokun explained in the opening of his presentation.\nWhile progress is being made on the highly anticipated solution, it also became clear in Milan that the lightning network is currently not quite ready for widespread deployment. It requires the yet-to-be-activated\u00a0Segregated\u00a0Witness solution on Bitcoin\u2019s main chain, and another open topic for debate is the question of routing: how transactions find their path throughout the second-layer network.\nAs different ideas were discussed before, during and after the Scaling Bitcoin workshops, BitFury developer Pavel Prikhodko had to conclude his presentation on lightning routing by pointing out that \u201cthere is still no sensible topology and behavioral of network, and we need it for better experiments and fine tuning.\u201d\nSidechain Scaling\nThe other big second-layer technology proposed was the use of sidechains: extra blockchains that could be made to be interoperable with Bitcoin\u2019s main chain and currency unit. Sidechains were originally proposed as a solution to expand Bitcoin\u2019s capabilities, but some believe that the technology could offer scaling solutions as well.\nWith perhaps the most explicit reference to the ongoing block-size debate,\u00a0Bloq statistician Paul Sztorc argued that sidechain technology could offer benefits provided by larger blocks while containing the risk to those actually using the added chain. If something bad were to happen on a big-block sidechain, any damage would be limited to users of that chain without impacting the main network.\nUsing an analogy of the root of a weed and its leaves, Sztorc argued:\n\u201cThere's a weed beneath ground. \u2026 But then you have this other part above, where the sunlight is. \u2026 You have to kill the whole thing; otherwise it regenerates the upper part from the lower part. You have a lot of hopelessness in removing weeds or killing the blockchain. \u2026 You can do a lot of fun stuff off-chain. That's the core of this idea.\u201d\nMimbleWimble\nIn one of the most ambitious proposals of the weekend, Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra explained the potential of\u00a0MimbleWimble. Mysteriously dropped on the \u201cbitcoin-wizards\u201d IRC-channel two months ago, a white paper by the pseudonymous \u201cTom Elvis Jedusor\u201d\u2014 Voldemort\u2019s real name in the French version of the Harry Potter novels \u2014 rethinks Bitcoin\u2019s basic transaction structure. As a key benefit of MimbleWimble, matching inputs and outputs can be canceled out over time, drastically reducing the amount of data required to be stored by Bitcoin nodes.\nBecause all transactions included in a single block can effectively be merged and have amounts hidden, MimbleWimble could hugely increase fungibility as well. Taking MimbleWimble from a theoretical proposal to an attainable feature, Poelstra proposed that \u201cwe can actually make MimbleWimble as a sidechain.\u201d\nFor a complete overview and videos of all speaker sessions, visit\u00a0scalingbitcoin.com.", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 11}

In the debate of Bitcoin versus blockchain technology (whatever that is supposed to mean these days,) the correct option is going to depend on what sort of functionality is needed to solve a problem.\n\u201cWe are using the Bitcoin blockchain because we believe it is the most secure and tamper proof \u00a0distributed public ledger out there,\u201d Civic CEO, Vinny Lingham, who is a speaker at Money 20/20, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cIt's not perfect, but it serves our needs for now. We are ultimately not dependent on it, but choose to use the Bitcoin blockchain on its merits. If things change over time and we find a better solution, we will consider switching, but for now nothing else comes close to serving our needs.\u201d\nCivic is a startup focused on identity theft protection. Before becoming the CEO of Civic, Lingham founded Gyft, which is popular method of converting bitcoin into gift cards that can be used in everyday transactions.\nMany of the blockchain technology projects in development right now don\u2019t look much like Bitcoin, and they also come with a different set of security tradeoffs. Those who are still focused on Bitcoin find proof-of-work to be the most interesting aspect of this new technology.\nThe Limits of Blockchain Technology\nThe eventual direction of Bitcoin and blockchain technology is still unclear at this point, and according to Lingham, it will not be a one-size-fits-all solution for every startup. In Lingham\u2019s view, blockchain is a protocol, and \u201cit delivers [exceptionally] low-level value for new companies in particular.\u201d\n\u201cAs you add layers of abstraction on it, you can build cheaper, faster and more secure businesses that can disrupt the status quo.\u201d\nLingham\u2019s point is that competent developers and entrepreneurs are needed to build on top of blockchain protocols. \u201cIf you have a bunch of amateurs who can't build a business in the first place, giving them blockchain to innovate on is probably not going to yield favorable results. Because at the end of the day, the technologists and entrepreneurs using it need to still build real companies that capture and create value for end users,\u201d said Lingham. \u201cBlockchain is a tool and if you give the worst builder in the world the best tools, you're still going to get junk.\u201d\nFor now, Lingham and Civic see Bitcoin as the most practical tool for the startup in the realm of blockchain protocols.\nMoney 20/20 will run from October 23 - 26, 2016 in Las Vegas.", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 24}

Only Big Boy currencies are included, and now China is part of the club: USD, GBP, JPY, EUR and now CNY make up the basket.\nThe IMF could not ignore the currency of the world\u2019s second largest economy. In order to be considered, China pledged to speed up the internationalization of the CNY. That meant gradually opening up its capital account, and gradually allowing the market to determine the value of the CNY.\nChina isn\u2019t one to follow diktats of foreign countries to the letter, but Beijing recognizes that the Yuan\u2019s addition to this symbolic basket is one step further toward legitimizing their economy and the methods by which they manage it.\nBut will\u00a0China play ball now that it is in the club? The Yuan has depreciated over 7 percent this year. Everyone agrees that the Yuan will need to weaken. At issue\u00a0is the pace and eventual magnitude of that weakening.\nChina is addicted to credit-fueled growth. Beijing recognizes the problem, but credit growth continues. Someone will need to bear the losses. It will either be heavy industry or the household sector. The problem for Beijing is that the heavy industry sector is politically powerful, and more importantly, employs millions of workers. Social unrest will not be tolerated. The number one goal of the CCP is remaining in power. As such, state-owned banks are still directing loans to zombie state-owned industrial companies and the property sector.\nChina cannot continue to print money and defend the Yuan from massive depreciation at the same time. Companies and individuals are fleeing the coming domestic inflation by exporting their capital abroad. I argue that, in the absence of the IMF SDR review period and inclusion, China would have already depreciated the Yuan much further. \u00a0If they sliced the Yuan by 30 percent, while at the same time applying to be a global reserve currency, China would have lost face internationally. If you have lived in this part of the world long enough, you know that losing face is to be avoided at all costs.\nThose who look to official figures on FX reserves as evidence that capital outflow is waning are being fooled. Chinese companies continue to do massive M&A deals globally. Chinese citizens continue to levitate luxury property markets across the globe. Vancouver recently implemented a 15 percent foreigner property tax to deter the ravenous Chinese.\nNow that China has officially joined the club. They are free to monkey-hammer their currency, just like the Fed, ECB, BOJ, and BOE do, and not lose face doing it. Quantitative easing is just a fancy name for money printing. Western central bankers are masters at it, and now China will openly play the game as well.\nTraders will be watching the 9:15 am reference rate of the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) closely. The PBOC\u2019s actions in the first week after the inclusion will help frame expectations for future actions. Now that Fed rate hike odds for November and December are rising, we can expect the PBOC to come out with guns blazing. A year end USD-CNY rate of 7.00 is definitely in the cards.\nDon\u2019t forget about Europe. One or more banks might meet the reaper in Q4. The PBOC will need to inject more money to mitigate any spillover contagion from China. After all, the Golden Week calm\u00a0we're experiencing now is a chimera. Next week the fun begins again.\nThe trend is clear. CNY down, BTC up. If the PBOC begins Q4 by slicing the Yuan, bitcoin will be jolted from the doldrums. The path to $1,000 will be paved with depreciating Renminbi.\nThis op-ed is a guest post by Arthur Hayes.

Dash, a privacy-centric, open-source, digital money ecosystem, has therefore chosen to integrate AML/KYC solutions designed to manage these concerns, in cooperation with blockchain compliance provider Coinfirm.\nSome are hailing this move as a key milestone in addressing vulnerabilities tied to fraud and money laundering. Others are more skeptical, viewing it as potentially undermining Dash\u2019s core tenets around privacy. \u00a0\nDash, viewed by its proponents as an enhanced version of Bitcoin, has garnered a great deal of media attention of late for its decentralized platform that allows digital cash to be spent online at merchants and service providers worldwide. Its features include instant transfers, low fees, and high levels of privacy and security.\nAs the seventh most valued digital currency, with an $82 million market cap, Dash\u2019s self-funded, independently-governed community is comprised of over 15,000 users that facilitate over a million dollars in transactions every 24 hours. These transactions are verified by users through a global network of over 4000 master nodes.\nDash\u2019s new collaborator, the London-based Coinfirm, is a risk and compliance platform offering compliance services for blockchain-based transactions. The platform employs proprietary algorithms that address AML/CFT, credit risk assessment, and other regulatory requirements pertaining to digital currencies. This gives institutions the ability to properly evaluate clients with speed and agility, ultimately allowing them greater access to new pools of clientele.\nThe Present Landscape\nIn the case of digital currencies like Dash, integrating with new product and service delivery models is a challenge. \u00a0With these regulation requirements varying across such a wide global geography, compliance often becomes a painstaking, complex and costly undertaking.\nCoinfirm\u2019s role is to navigate these linkages in a manner that allows Dash to work for the first time with commercial and financial institutions that are already subject to compliance requirements. Besides streamlining the onboarding process for new corporate clients, the Coinfirm platform will manage all ongoing AML monitoring by synchronizing with Dash\u2019s blockchain network. Counterparty verification, risk assessments and fraud management are among the many deliverables that Coinfirm will provide on behalf of Dash.\nIn addition, Coinfirm will offer reports that allow Dash\u2019s entrepreneur user base the ability to create their own verifiable Dash credit history and rating. As a result, this community will now have control of a faster track for launching new product and service offerings directed toward their strategic customer niche.\nAccording to Coinfirm Co-founder and CEO Pawel Kuskowski, his firm\u2019s partnership with Dash represents a major development in aligning the digital currency space with the larger world of commerce. \u201cWe believe that creating the first compliant digital currency ecosystem holds great significance, and will achieve broad acceptance by regulators, financial institutions, entities and individuals,\u201d Kuskowski said to Bitcoin Magazine.\n\u201cThis collaboration is the result of the immense benefits we can see, not just for our two firms, but for the entire blockchain, cryptocurrency and the financial system as a whole. This will set a standard, benchmark and precedent for the future, demonstrating how digital currencies and privacy can properly coexist, and strike a balance with the prevailing requirements of the financial world.\u201d\nKuskowski believes that regulatory compliance is one of the key hurdles to overcome before the commercial and mass adoption of digital currencies can happen. \u201cWe've all seen how media coverage has portrayed some aspects of digital currencies over the years, and how the commercial and financial world has approached it. AML and compliance has been one of the main reasons why the two worlds haven't gelled yet, and is a large roadblock for entities already operating in the space. Our joint effort with Dash is a major move in addressing this.\u201d\nNew Possibilities for Dash\nSpeaking with Bitcoin Magazine, Ryan Taylor, Director of Finance at Dash, says that this new collaborative effort with Coinfirm will open up potential opportunities to \u201cexpand into products and services that\u00a0we haven\u2019t been able to provide or integrate in the past. We\u2019re super excited about this because it\u2019s definitely a game changer in terms of what we can do moving forward.\u201d\nTaylor notes that nothing will fundamentally change with Dash\u2019s core protocol, product and privacy elements as a result of this partnership. What this move addresses, he says, are efforts to build mass adoption through the addition of new products and services through various business partnerships.\nSays Taylor: \u201cI think there was a lot of early, negative reaction to all of this from both in and outside of our community \u2014 because the perception was that Dash was somehow being regulated. That\u2019s not the case, however. We are simply seeking to greatly expand the number of businesses that integrate with Dash, most of whom already have to meet AML and KYC compliance requirements.\n\u201cPersonally, I\u2019ve already spent quite a bit of time on our public Slack channel yesterday answering questions and addressing what I see are knee-jerk reactions. A lot of users reacted very negatively to the media headlines without understanding the limits and full implications of what it is that we\u2019re doing. I listened and once 95 percent of the users had their questions answered, they were much more comfortable with the direction we\u2019re headed.\u201d \u00a0\nTaylor says that a user is affected only if they start interacting with a regulated businesses that Dash is partnered with. He offers this clarifying example: \u00a0\u201cSo if I receive bitcoin from someone else and then exchange those funds for Dash, I, as a user, would be unaffected. But if I wanted to buy or sell Dash directly on a site like Coinbase, I would have to go through Coinbase\u2019s compliance requirements. This is true for any exchange or money transmitter that wants to provide a similar buy/sell option.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\nCompliance isn\u2019t the only issue that Dash has been dealing with lately. Another is the recent decision by Apple to ban Dash from its app store. \u00a0\n\u201cWe are very disappointed that Apple has chosen to filter certain currencies \u2014 including Dash at present,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cApple is not highly transparent about the reasons why certain currencies are approved or not approved. That\u2019s been frustrating for many of us in the cryptocurrency community. It makes it hard to figure out what exactly we should be working on.\n\u201cI think, though, that Apple is dealing with a rather difficult problem, as they have faced a lot of fraudulent wallets that have made their way into their app store, resulting in the loss of consumer funds. Apple is first and foremost interested in protecting consumers from this type of fraud. They also receive a ton of new wallet approval requests. So I think they\u2019re struggling a bit to get their arms around this evolving ecosystem. My wish is that they would engage with the community more as a whole, and would communicate more clearly what the requirements are and what they evaluate when it comes to both currencies and wallets.\u201d\nAt the end of the day, Taylor says that this compliance partnership with Coinfirm is ultimately about improving the overall ecosystem for Dash users. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to work with Coinfirm because it really does open up a large number of doors for us in terms of opportunities to build our ecosystem. I think that firms in the digital currency space will be much more willing to work with Dash and consider us an option as a result of this. And what\u2019s particularly exciting is, we can achieve this, while at the same time preserving all of the privacy features that make Dash so very compelling for the consumer.\u201d \u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 7}

The series comprises six episodes, with new episodes released daily through October 14th.\nWith footage shot on five continents, featuring a rolling set of soundbites from thought leaders and experts, \u201cTrust Disrupted\u201d explores both the short- and long-term implications of this digital movement.\u00a0\nEpisode One, entitled \u201cIn The Beginning,\u201d offers a brief look at the genesis of digital currency and how it captured worldwide attention in 2008 with the advent of Bitcoin and its supportive blockchain distributed ledger. It briefly notes how the institutions Bitcoin sought to disrupt \u2014 governments and big banks \u2014 are now exploring ways to advance those same infrastructural systems by integrating the technology .\nThe opening backdrop of this first episode features a bitcoin mining operation in Caracas, Venezuela. The piece delivers some broader context from Bobby Lee, Gavin Andresen, Fred Wilson, Vitalik Buterin and other big names in the world of digital currency and blockchain. Perhaps most notable is a clip of a presentation by former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, Lawrence Summers, debunking the long-term efficacy of bitcoin while simultaneously extolling the future role of blockchain technology in overcoming frictions that have long saddled the financial services industry.\nEpisode Two delves into the global network of Bitcoin Mines and Miners, the machines and humans behind everything from bitcoin transaction processing to system governance.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBlockstream engineers Paul \u201cRusty\u201d Russell and Dr. Christian Decker completed their first lightning transaction on Bitcoin\u2019s testnet this week. The test transaction was made using the latest version of the Blockstream\u2019s lightning prototype software, lightningd 0.5 and consisted of a digital purchase from a web-store.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine Decker said:\n\u201cThis is a big milestone for us. It's the first time we have a channel setup on a real blockchain, with real latencies and block rates, and it's the first multi-hop transaction, where a payment for a digital good routes from one node to another through a third node.\u201d\nMaking the Transaction\nThe highly anticipated lightning network is a proposed second-layer protocol to be rolled out on top of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. Cleverly utilizing Bitcoin\u2019s programmable elements (e.g., multi-signature and timelock) lightning users should be able to make a virtually unlimited number of off-chain transactions at low cost, potentially boosting Bitcoin\u2019s micropayment-ability and overall scalability.\nSeveral teams are currently working on different implementations of lightning software. Only last week, BitFury, Lightning Labs and ACINQ announced a successful test of proposed lightning routing system Flare, whereas a Lightning Labs developer had previously completed lightning transactions to himself. Blockchain, meanwhile, made lightning-style transactions on the alpha version of their Thunder network \u2014 though these are not yet trustless or secure.\nBlockstream\u2019s team is now the first to have conducted a successful and trustless transaction between two developers on Bitcoin\u2019s testnet, which served as a \u201creal\u201d payment.\n\u201cWe've spent over a year working on different parts of the protocol, and from a technical perspective, simply sewing them together isn't challenging,\u201d Russell explained. \u201cBut it's easy for us geeks to miss the forest for the trees. For this transaction, I acted as an actual vendor, and Christian made an actual purchase. It involved infrastructure for creating invoices, giving them to the user, and checking if the user paid. We\u2019re not just sending money point-to-point.\u201d\nUse of Testnet\nBlockstream\u2019s first transaction was done over testnet, a network specifically designed for testing new Bitcoin features. Testnet also has Segregated Witness deployed, which is required for the lightning network to function in a trustless and secure manner.\n\u201cThis roll-out on testnet gives people who want to build on Lightning, like wallet developers, a chance to try it out and provide feedback on APIs, find bugs and more,\u201d Russell said. \u201cThe change from testnet to the actual Bitcoin network is actually trivial in the code. The difference is that mistakes on the actual Bitcoin network cost real money.\u201d\nCreating a transaction with lightning is currently still very much a manual process. Most importantly, users need to open connections to other nodes\u2019 IP addresses themselves. Decker did note, however, that he already wrote a patch to make peers announce their contact information, which will make this process easier.\n\u201cOur routing implementation relies on knowing every connection. That works for now, but obviously something more ambitious is being worked on, like BitFury\u2019s Flare,\u201d Russell said.\nAdditionally, onion routing for increased privacy is also in the works, and might even make it into the upcoming lightningd 0.5 release.\nScaling Implications\nLightning is often heralded as an important step for Bitcoin scalability, a topic that will be discussed at length during the upcoming Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Milan this weekend. In the days after the workshop, the different teams working on lightning will also come together to discuss compatibility of the different implementations.\n\u201cUnfortunately Mats Jerratsch of Blockchain\u2019s Thunder Network won't be there, but it seems like every other implementer will,\" said\u00a0Russell.\u00a0\"We\u2019ll go through the components of lightning and find the protocol we'd like to standardize on. Afterwards, we'll have to rework some of our own protocol, based on group decisions by the other lightning teams trying to arrive at an interoperable spec.\u201d\nDespite the successful test, Russell and Decker explained it will still take some time before lightning transactions will happen on top of the main Bitcoin network. Before lightning can be rolled out, Segregated Witness must first be activated, bugs in lightningd must be found and fixed, and it must be made more robust against misconfiguration. Then, the Blockstream team wants to create libraries to allow web developers to play with constructing their use-cases.\n\u201cWe would like to build a small ecosystem on testnet and give people some hands-on experience before moving to mainnet,\u201d said Decker.\nFor more information on the lightning network, read Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s three-part series on the technology.\nRussell and Decker made a short video-demo of the first transaction, which can be viewed\u00a0here.\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 7}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nThrough an exclusive partnership with real estate tech startup Velox.re, Chicago\u2019s Cook County will test the use of the Bitcoin blockchain for transferring and tracking property titles and other public records. The Cook County Recorder\u2019s Office is the second largest such office in the United States, and it it will be the first in the country to experiment with blockchain technology.\nSpecifically, the office will be testing blockchain applications of property title transfer and a system for filing liens; compatibility between a blockchain and a traditional, server-based setup; fraudulent use prevention and conveyances of vacant property in Chicago.\nIn addition to Velox.re and the Cook County Recorder\u2019s Office, the International Blockchain Real Estate Association (IBREA), Armour Settlement Services, and global law firm Hogan Lovells are involved with the closed pilot project.\nThe project was first announced by Velox.re Founder and CEO Ragnar Lifthrasir on Wednesday at the MIPIM PropTech Summit, which is part of New York City Real Estate Tech Week 2016.\nVelox.re\u2019s own implementation of the open assets protocol, which is a version of the colored coins concept, will be used to test these various use cases, making this an implementation where the public Bitcoin blockchain (not a permissioned ledger) is being used.\n\"Real estate blockchain initiatives in other countries have used a private blockchain as an improved database of some existing land records,\u201d Lifthrasir told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThis was a great first step.\u201d\u201cOur pilot program takes things further. Velox.re is using Bitcoin [blockchain]. We're using it to actually convey property and register liens. We're performing high value transactions on the blockchain.

This is the first time this has been done in the U.S. or [anywhere else in] the world.\"\nEarlier this year, the government of Vermont released a report regarding the potential use of blockchain technology for public record keeping.\nCook County Ready to Test the Blockchain\nAccording to Deputy Recorder of Deeds for Communication and IT, John Mirkovic, the Cook County Recorder of Deeds Office has been watching blockchain technology closely as a potential next-generation land records system. \u201cWe are excited to partner with a group that is actually interested in how this technology can work in real world situations,\u201d said Mirkovic. \u201cA blockchain-based public record is where you would start if you were to create a public land record from scratch, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so interested in seeing this take a foothold in the United States.\u201d\nLifthrasir, who also founded the International Blockchain Real Estate Association, says Velox.re\u2019s software can help reduce fraud while also simplifying and the lowering the costs associated with property records. \u201cJohn and his team are leading the way for other government agencies in the United States,\u201d he added.\nAccording to a press release from the Cook County Recorder of Deeds, the office has identified three aspects of blockchain technology that make it a viable option for their activities: a permanent, immutable public record that is immune to well-funded nation-state attacks; a path towards paperless land transfers and so-called \u201ce-deeds\u201d; and reduced costs for offices across the country that want to upgrade electronic document processing systems. \u201cThese features can make real estate more liquid and transactions more seamless and secure,\u201d added the press release.\nMore Help from Others\nIBREA will help get local individuals involved with the pilot program on the ground. The organization, which advocates for the use of the blockchain for various real estate-related purposes, will specifically target those with a stake in the local real estate industry. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to bringing investors, developers, and community members to participate in these blockchain based transactions,\u201d said IBREA Chicago Chair Sead Odzic.\nTali Raphaely, President of Armour Settlement Services, a nationwide title and settlement services company also commented, \u201c[we are] very excited to be a part of this pioneering effort, and honored to help create an immutable database that will help reduce the likelihood that property owners and investors spend money on properties that can never be occupied or conveyed.\u201d\nWhat Happens Next?\nIt\u2019s important to remember that this is simply a pilot program, and the Cook County Recorder\u2019s Office will need to reflect on the results of the project after a testing period. During this same time, IBREA will work to advocate for changes to laws in Illinois that could create an easier path towards the adoption of blockchain technology for these sorts of use cases.\nThe findings of this experimental project will be presented at the second annual IBREA conference, which is planned for March 2017.", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 6}

As a multi-token, blockchain interface, the blockchain-agnostic Jaxx wallet operates on nine platforms and pairs across all user devices for nearly all of its supported currencies.\nAt a time when Apple is being cautious about what it allows into its app store, Jaxx became the first iOS wallet to transact in Ether, the native currency of Ethereum\u2019s smart contract platform.\nOn October 10, Di Iorio told Bitcoin Magazine that Jaxx is now planning to support Monero,\u00a0an open-source digital currency known for robust privacy and scalability features. He was informed by an Apple representative that Monero is now included in\u00a0its list of currencies approved for the App Store.\n\u201cMonero is a very interesting technology with a unique system that involves an additional level of nuance in terms of wallet integration. We are working on getting Monero connected to Jaxx as we speak,\u201d said Di Iorio. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve been in regular communication with the Monero team and are looking at a three-week timetable, the end of October to early November, in terms of a launch.\u201d\nMonero is chiefly known for its privacy. Its native currency, XMR, is one of the top altcoins by market cap, and is now accepted as payment on several sites, including some associated with dark net markets. Unlike many other digital currencies, Monero is not based on Bitcoin\u2019s code-base or protocol; rather, it is based on the CryptoNote reference implementation, an altcoin that was designed from scratch.\nKeeping Tabs on Apple\nDi Iorio has also been closely following the ever-changing developments around the acceptance or rejection of iOS apps. Now that Augur is live, Jaxx has added REP to its suite of currencies, and Di Iorio was recently informed by Apple that REP has been added to its list of approved currencies.\nAnd then there was Dash. \u201cWe tried to get Dash on the app store via Jaxx, but it came back as a non-approved coin. Apple stated that they were only accepting a limited number of coins at the time, but since then they\u2019ve added more.\u201d Dash is, however, available on all other Jaxx-supported devices.\nDi Iorio says that the overall blockchain ecosystem continues to percolate along with lots of new technologies and coins, some with value and some without. He notes that, with quite a few initial coin offerings and new wallets being launched, there\u2019s been a lot of sectarianism, with many people endorsing and making use of one particular product because they have a stake in it.\nHe views the digital currency ecosystem as one that needs to continue to develop, without picking winners and losers too quickly. \u201cThere has certainly been an influx of both good and crappy projects. So I think the ones that actually provide value will gain traction in this space, while the crappy ones probably aren\u2019t going to have a successful go of it.\u201d\nIn terms of what\u2019s next for Jaxx, Di Iorio concludes: \u201cWe are constantly examining ways to direct our efforts toward those technologies that are creating value for our customers and the entire blockchain ecosystem.

An estimated 14.3 million households in Tokyo, Saitama, Chiba, Kanagawa, and the Ibaraki area subscribe to TOYKO MX, making it a wide-reaching channel that covers 80 percent of the Kanto area in Japan. Combined with the fact that BitGirls will be hosted by two popular TV talents, comedian Eiji Shibata and actress/talent model Risa Yoshiki, it is poised to attract a large number of viewers when it airs.\nOver the course of the first season the six girls \u2014 Djasanyan, Sanomaya, Chikarin, Satoayaka, Tsukasa, and Kaori \u2014 will undertake various challenges with the television hosts. Each girl \u201cbecomes\u201d a digital currency. Viewers show their support for their favorite girl by buying her tokens known as Torekabu. This is a combination of two Japanese words: toreaka, meaning trading cards and kabu, meaning stock shares.\nOn October 3, the BitGirls Initial Coin Offering (ICO) crowdsale launched on the producers\u2019 Osaka-based platform Zaif Exchange. Each Torekabu will be limited to five million tokens: 3.5 million will be sold in the Initial Coin Offering which began on October 3, one million will be reserved, and 0.5 million will be set aside for marketing and operational costs by the committee.\nTorekabu will be traded in Zaif, Counterparty, bitcoin, and XEM, the digital currency of the New Economy Movement (NEM) blockchain. Fans who want to vote have to buy Torekabu coins with these currencies; therefore, they will first need to buy an entry digital currency before they can buy the Torekabu associated with the individual BitGirl of their choice.\nThen, as the value of each Torekabu token increases, depending on the popularity of the girl associated with that Torekabu, viewers will also receive voting tokens named HYOU, paid out as dividends based on the numbers of shares in that token that they own.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Takao Asayama, CEO of Tech Bureau Corp, the parent firm of Zaif Exchange and the show\u2019s producers, said that voting would decide the direction and content of future TV shows. According to Asayama, the market cap of the individual BitGirls\u2019 tokens will decide the girls\u2019 ranks in the TV show. Each girl\u2019s performance on TV will affect her popularity, thus increasing or decreasing the value of her token, and influencing viewers\u2019 trading behaviors.\n\u201cThis means that people have to watch [the] TV live instead of recording it, otherwise viewers could miss a good time to sell [or] buy Torekabu,\u201d Asayama said.\nAsayama said that BitGirls is aiming to be the first to achieve the Web 2 TV 2 Web loop whereby voting via the Internet decides the content of the TV shows.\n\nAttracting a New Audience for Bitcoin and Digital Currencies\nThe making of BitGirls didn\u2019t come easily. In Japan, TV stations have strict screening rules. The fact that BitGirls has been given the green light is considered a breakthrough. After teaming up with an ambitious production company, they managed to pass the screening, making it the first TV show that offers a dedicated digital currency and blockchain-based service.\nThe aim of BitGirls is to take a product that is often thought of as too difficult or too complicated to understand by creating a user-friendly crypto project. The show aims to achieve this by combining entertainment and the idea of ICOs and crowdsales in order to give users\u2019 a better understanding of how the blockchain and digital currencies can work. Their mission is to make it fun.\nViewers that take part in the show and use their tokens to vote will be able to track and audit the voting live as it takes place on the Bitcoin blockchain. Once a vote has been placed it can\u2019t be reversed, censored or manipulated.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Trevor Altpeter, Counterparty Foundation director, said that Counterparty is very popular in Japan, with many people in the community already creating their own Counterparty tokens to experiment with the new concept of tokens on the blockchain.\n\u201cThe presence and familiarity of IndieSquare, the leading mobile token wallet and API provider, based in Tokyo is playing a role as well,\u201d Altpeter said.\nKoji Higashi, co-founder of IndieSquare believes that it is this mobile capability that produces a big advantage of using Counterparty compared to other similar protocols.\nWhen it comes to the adoption of digital currencies in Japan, however, its past has produced a negative impression with the failed Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox. According to Asayama, this makes adoption in Japan difficult.\n\u201cOur idea and goal is to make a reason to buy and use cryptos including bitcoin, especially for entertainment purposes,\u201d he said. \u201cThen people will know how it works and how it is great later on.\u201d\nWhile Altpeter believes that the BitGirls will be a success since it combines popularity of shows like American Idol with a financial element, Higashi takes a more tentative approach.\n\u201cAlthough bitcoin and tokens are an integral part of this show, whether it\u2019ll be successful or not really is up to the content and the quality of the show at the end of the day,\u201d Higashi said in an email. \u201cIf the show helps improve the public perception of bitcoin and blockchain technology in Japan, I think we can call it a success, and some positive signs are already appearing.\u201d\nBy using \u201cidols,\u201d a growing social phenomenon in Japanese culture, the company hopes that it will attract a large following of people who admire these aspiring starlets.\nHigashi says that he has already seen the impact this is having on the idol community with many of them trying to learn about bitcoin so that they can support their idols. Before the show, Higashi added, the same people would never have thought about buying or using bitcoins before.\n\u201cIf bitcoin is to go mainstream and appeal to regular people, it has to gain more support from celebrities and famous figures, in my opinion, and BitGirls can be a significant step forward for bitcoin and Counterparty adoption in Japan,\u201d he said.\nAltpeter agrees that the unique concept of BitGirls will help to legitimize bitcoin-based asset protocols.\n\u201cIt is likely that BitGirls will be the catalyst for future media projects by providing a proven framework for content producers to follow,\u201d Altpeter concluded.", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 11}

Politics, banking, and money are all related. Major changes in a country\u2019s governance will have huge implications for monetary policy.\nTrump\nTrump is the King of Debt. He is no stranger to bankruptcy and financial leverage. His presidency would put America First, jeopardizing trade deals. He is attempting to pitch himself as a 21st century Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Roosevelt is famous for the New Deal, which involved massive infrastructure spending. While FDR is credited by many for lifting America out of the Great Depression, in reality it is much easier to rebuild your economy when your trading partners are being Blitzkrieged.\nDuring the recent debates, Trump promised to upgrade the America\u2019s airports, roads, bridges \u2014 and walls. That costs a lot of money. Where will this money come from? Most likely Trump will engage in massive government spending and borrowing.\nIn the same debate, Trump voiced concerns that the Fed has not raised interest rates. He implied that the Fed has kept rates too low for too long, and that as a result a day of reckoning will occur. If Trump is to begin a massive round of infrastructure spending, he surely doesn\u2019t want to be doing that when the 30 year US Treasury bond yields north of 5%.\nThe King of Debt will want the cheapest borrowing costs possible. Which means a continuation of easy monetary policies from the Fed.\nClinton\nHillary Clinton promises more of the same. She has been wheeling and dealing in the beltway since the 1970s. Her pitch is a continuation of the policies of the past eight years. She even served as Secretary of State under Obama for a portion of that time.\nMore of the same means more government spending. More taxes and more goodies for everyone, both rich and poor. Contrary to the image she tries to project of a down-to-earth good ole gal, Clinton is quite comfortable eating at Dorsia with Oliver Peoples-wearing \u201cFin\u0101nciers.\u201d\nThe financial institutions are big supporters of Clinton, and she will not disappoint them; her husband didn\u2019t, and neither will she. Massive government spending for the poor and middle class, and massive monetary printing for the moneyed elites. That is what will be on order with Clinton.\nSimilar to a Trump presidency, government spending will accelerate. The Fed will need keep the printing presses humming to accommodate the fiscal spending.\nSame Same But Different\nThe Devil you know (Clinton) and the Devil you don\u2019t (Trump) both promise to increase government spending. These bonds will be monetised by the Fed lest interest rates spike higher. The Fed will actually welcome an increased supply of government bonds to buy. As it stands, the US government is not spending enough to accommodate the Fed\u2019s appetite for debt securities.\nCentral banks around the world have lamented the lack of fiscal spending. They believe that monetary policy cannot be the sole answer to economic problems. Governments need to pick up the slack. They need to engage in spending and enact policies to resolve structural economic issues.\nThe issuance of U.S. Treasuries has slowed. While the U.S. government runs persistent deficits, they are getting smaller. The pool of eligible bonds the Fed can buy is shrinking. That is partly why they were forced to suspend QE purchases. They faced the risk of completely owning the bond market. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) 30-year saga to end deflation resulted in the death of the Japanese Government Bond (JGB) market.\nThe BOJ owns so much of the supply, the market has ceased to function. The JGB market is now a ghost town. The Fed will be very happy that both presidential candidates advocate increased government spending. They desperately want to restart QE, and a President Trump or President Clinton will enable that.\nFor bitcoin and other digital currencies this trend is positive. The inflation brought upon by increased Fed largesse will continue to bleed into assets free from central bank manipulation.\nReal estate and gold are the traditional assets savers flee to in times of inflation. The problem is that these assets are not portable and are subject to ex-post taxation. What better way to tax the rich than to raise property taxes and gold transaction taxes?\nThe appeal of Bitcoin is that, whether you own $1 or $1 billion worth, it costs nothing to store, it can be accessed anywhere via an internet connection, and it is unlikely to be the (successful) target of a tax grab.\nThis op-ed is a guest post by Arthur Hayes.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe soon-to-be proposed\u00a0Segregated\u00a0Witness soft fork is set to extend Bitcoin\u2019s potential in several ways. One potentially promising innovation enabled by \u201cSegWit\u201d is MAST, an abbreviation for Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees. While mainly designed to increase smart contract flexibility, MAST would increase scalability and privacy on the platform at the same time. The idea of MAST originates from\u00a0Blockstream developer Russell O\u2019Connor, Blockstream and\u00a0Bitcoin Core developer, Dr. Pieter Wuille, and Bitcoin Core developer, Peter Todd. It was recently drafted into an initial\u00a0Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) by Bitcoin Core developer Dr. Johnson Lau. Given its potential, MAST is surprisingly straightforward.\nP2SH: A Primer\nOne part of the MAST puzzle is based on\u00a0P2SH, which has been used in certain Bitcoin transactions for several years now.\nAll Bitcoin transactions in effect \u201clock bitcoins up\u201d in outputs, which typically refer to Bitcoin addresses. These bitcoins are locked to be unlocked (and then locked again) in a later transaction; that\u2019s how bitcoins effectively move from address to address.\nThis locking-up is really done with a script \u2014 a couple lines of code. For standard transactions, the script is included in the output and defines the requirement to spend bitcoins in a later transaction.\nMost non-standard Bitcoin transactions, like\u00a0multisig or\u00a0CheckLockTimeVerify, use a slightly more complex scheme, called \u201cP2SH\u201d (which stands for Pay to Script Hash). With P2SH, bitcoins are still locked up in a script. But this script is itself not included in the transaction-output. Rather, the script is hashed; it\u2019s scrambled and condensed into a short and seemingly random string of numbers. This string of numbers cannot be used to reproduce the original script. But with the original script, the string of numbers can be reproduced by simply hashing it again. The hash of the script is what\u2019s included in the transaction-output.\nTo unlock a P2SH-output in a next transaction, it\u2019s not sufficient to meet the requirements as defined in the script. After all, Bitcoin nodes on the network only know the hash of the script; not the actual script. These nodes, therefore, cannot verify that the requirements as defined in the script are met. They cannot confirm the transaction.\nThat\u2019s why the next transaction, which spends the bitcoins, must include the whole script, as well as the requirements as defined in that script: the lock (script) itself, as well as the key (requirements) to unlock it.\nBy hashing the actual script, Bitcoin nodes can verify that the included script matches the script hash that was included in the previous output. If it matches, nodes know that the bitcoins were indeed locked into that specific script. Then they can verify that the requirements as defined in the script were met, and the transaction can be confirmed.\nMerkle Trees: A Primer\nThe other part of the MAST puzzle is a cryptographic trick called\u00a0Merkle tee.\nA Merkle tree is basically a mathematical structure that hashes different sets of data into a single, compact hash: the Merkle root. Much like any other hash, this Merkle root cannot be used to recreate the data in the Merkle tree.\nBut Merkle trees offers a unique benefit. If any of the data in the Merkle tree is known, the Merkle root can be used to verify that that specific data is really somewhere in the Merkle tree \u2014 even if not all data in the Merkle tree is known.\nAs a simplified example, let\u2019s say Alice made a Merkle tree by combining the data sets \u201c123\u201d and \u201c456,\u201d and that Merkle tree\u2019s Merkle root turns out to be \u201c789.\u201d Alice then tells Bob that data package \u201c123\u201d is somewhere in this Merkle tree. Now, with just the Merkle root (\u201c789\u201d), Bob can verify that \u201c123\u201d is indeed included somewhere in the Merkle tree, even though he has no idea that \u201c456\u201d is in there as well. In fact, for all he knows, there could be thousands of data packages in the Merkle tree \u2014 and he couldn\u2019t decipher any of them.\nMAST: P2SH + Merkle Trees\nMAST essentially merges the potential of P2SH with that offered by Merkle trees.\nInstead of locking bitcoins up into a single script, with MAST the same bitcoins can be locked up in a series of different scripts. In other words, the same bitcoins can be locked up under a set of different and mutually exclusive conditions. (For example, requiring a cryptographic signature from only Alice, or a signature from Bob and Carol each, or a signature from only Carol after a certain amount of time has passed, and so forth.)\nWhichever of these conditions is met in a (confirmed) transaction first determines how the bitcoins are spent. (If Alice is the first to sign a transaction spending the output, that transaction is valid. If Bob and Carol beat Alice to it, that\u2019s the valid transaction. Or if a certain amount of time has passed and Carol is the first to sign, that is the valid one.)\nMuch like P2SH, all these different scripts are hashed. But this time, they\u2019re combined into a Merkle tree. And it\u2019s the Merkle root of this Merkle tree that\u2019s included in a transaction-output, as a sort of ultimate lock.\nSpending funds, then, resembles P2SH as well. To create a transaction that unlocks funds from the Merkle root, the whole script used must be included in the new transaction, as well as the requirement to unlock that script. (The lock and the key.)\nBut importantly: not all potential scripts (locks) must be included. Only the one that is actually used. (If Alice spends the funds first, she does not need to include the script that lets Bob and/or Carol spend the funds. In fact, Alice doesn\u2019t even need to know that Bob and/or Carol could have also spent the funds.)\nBitcoin nodes can verify that the included script checks out by utilizing the Merkle tree trick. They use the Merkle root included in the output to check if the script used is really included in the Merkle tree. If it is, these nodes know that the included script checks out as one of the options to spend the bitcoins and can validate the new transaction.\nBenefits\nMAST improves Bitcoin in three main ways: it extends smart contract flexibility; improves scalability; and increases privacy.\nThe type of smart contract flexibility offered by MAST is not entirely new \u2014 there were already some \u201ceither/or\u201d constructs possible with only P2SH. (Requiring a signature from only Alice, or a signature from Bob and Carol, etc.) But there is a currently protocol-imposed size limit on different options to prevent DoS attacks.\nMAST extends smart contract flexibility since it removes any such limit. Whether there are two possible ways to spend bitcoins or 20 or 1000, it makes no difference to the network, only one script is included in the required transaction. This also enables new and complex possibilities, like 1-of-1000 multisig transactions, that would currently be too big. Or long lists of users that can spend specific bitcoins at different points in time.\nFurthermore, these types of \u201ceither/or\u201d constructs could, with P2SH, only be unlocked by ultimately publishing all of the scripts \u2014 not just the one used. This makes for big transactions, data-wise, and for expensive transactions, fee-wise. By only requiring users to include the script that is actually used in the end, MAST improves scalability. It reduces the amount of data that must be transmitted, validated and stored by all nodes on the network.\nAs an additional bonus, MAST improves privacy, again by the virtue of keeping unused scripts hidden forever. This could, for example, hide arbitrators from escrow transactions if they never come into play (because both trading parties use their 2-of-2 multisig-script, instead of the 2-of-3 version). Or it could hide never-used time-out safeguards from the public.\nAuthors note: MAST is still a work in progress; implementation details may differ from the explanation in this article.", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 13}

Today, at the Nokia Futurecom conference in Brazil, Nokia is partnering with Bitwalking, the Walking Dollars (W$) digital currency app, to launch its first charity fundraising event in S\u00e3o Paulo from October 17-20. Walkers will use the app to raise money for an educational project sponsored by Nokia in Latin America.\nThe idea behind Bitwalking is to encourage people to remain healthy by walking and get rewarded with Walking Dollars for their efforts. For over a year, the Bitwalking Android app has been undergoing private testing in several locations around the world. Instead of using computers to mine as other digital currencies do, Bitwalking Walking Dollars are mined through the simple act of walking; the more a person walks, the more they earn. The app is able to verify users\u2019 steps using a handset\u2019s GPS position via a Wi-Fi or data connection.\nDespite the fact that the mobile app has only recently become available to the general public, according to the Bitwalking team there have been approximately 50 thousand downloads on Google Play. Bitwalking recently debuted their Bitwalking Events Platform, an event dashboard providing real time analytics and progress updates for participants in all Bitwalking events, including the Nokia-Bitwalking Walk for Cause.\nFuturecom, the largest telecom, IT and internet trade fair in Latin America, is expected to attract 14,000 visitors. During the four-day event, users across Latin America will have the option to opt-in for the walking event through the Bitwalking app. \u00a0According to the Bitwalking team, 1W$ can be earned after approximately 15,000 steps. Tying the value of a W$ to the USD for every 1W$ raised, Nokia will donate $1USD for an educational project in Latin America that provides computers and (Android OS) Keepod devices to students in the region.\nFor Nissan Bahar and Franky Imbesi, founders of Bitwalking, Nokia\u2019s decision to partner with them is an important vote of confidence for Bitwalking and digital currencies.\n\u201cNokia was the fastest player in their category to recognize the opportunity and put it in action,\u201d Bahar told Bitcoin Magazine.\nDiana Coll, head of Marketing and Communications for Nokia, Latin America, said that the Nokia-Bitwalking Walk for Cause event at Futurecom was very important to help expand the human possibilities of the connected world, and that Bitwalking\u2019s platform was a natural fit.\n\u201cWe want to invent, design and deploy technologies that make a real difference to people\u2019s lives, and to take responsibility for the impact we can make in the world,\u201d Coll said to Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThrough this initiative we will be able to change the lives of hundreds of children just by combining technology and a daily activity for a cause.\u201d\nFitness-Tracking Trends\u00a0\nTaking advantage of the fitness tracking trend of logging personal walking stats, Bitwalking has added an extra incentive to keep fit with positive implications on personal health and the environment. It is also hoped that the app will get more people interested in digital currencies.\n\u201cBy design, digital currencies are not accessible to all,\u201d said Imbesi. \u201cThe digital currencies\u2019 potential is getting lost in the hands of a limited amount of people and organizations that don\u2019t really care about anyone besides themselves and their wish to maximize profits.\u201d\n\u201cWe have no doubt [this effort to popularize the technology] will help us to create a positive impact in the education of children from low-income families in Latin America,\u201d said Coll.\nAfter receiving positive feedback since the launch of the campaign earlier this month, Coll believes that the Nokia-Bitwalking event will attract a large number participants and that, through the use of platforms such as Bitwalking, digital currencies will become easier for people to access.\nThe Bitwalking Store\nAny Walking Dollars generated can be spent with third-party partners at the Bitwalking Store, once it is up and running. Eventually, walkers will have the ability to trade with other W$ users. At present, the store partners include Spotify Premium, Netflix, Tidal, and Mubi. According to Bahar, more partners and product categories will be added to the list.\nExtra Income\nPrevious startups that attempted to do the same thing failed simply because they were unable to measure movement correctly to prevent scammers from cheating the system. Bahar and Imbesi, though, believe that they now have a system that works.\nMotivating Bahar and Imbesi is the goal to make Bitwalking simple to use, focusing on the concept that \u201ca step is worth the same value for everyone \u2014 no matter who you are or where you are.\u201d\nWith 1W$ valued at $1USD, a very good walker can achieve that on a daily basis, says Bahar.\n\u201cThat amount might be your daily cup of coffee in part of the world, or a 30 percent increase in your salary or spending capacity in others,\u201d he said.\nAt the outset, W$ can only be spent in the Bitwalking Store. More details on the Bitwalking marketplace will be revealed as the app develops.", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 17}

This is especially true when it comes to transferring funds to Africa.\nHowever, in the eight years since Bitcoin was first launched, bitcoin remittances in Africa have not really taken off.\nBitcoin\u2019s Challenges in Kenya\nBitcoin is an industry that regularly likes to hype itself up. This has also been the case when it comes to Bitcoin adoption in Africa. As highlighted in a recent article by\u00a0VICE Motherboard, the rise of Bitcoin in Africa is largely a myth, predominantly propagated by Western enthusiasts and stakeholders. The reality is that Bitcoin adoption across the continent is growing, but at a rather slow pace.\nThe trend, however, is definitely positive, which can be seen by looking at trading volumes for\u00a0Kenya on the peer-to-peer exchange, LocalBitcoins.com. But overall volumes are still small compared to other parts of the world, and mainstream Bitcoin adoption is effectively non-existent.\nBitcoin users in Kenya and other parts of Africa are predominantly limited to tech-savvy freelancers who get paid in bitcoin and digital currency traders who trade in it to generate a profit. The biggest hurdle for Bitcoin in Kenya, however, is the widespread use of the mobile money service MPesa, which is owned by the country\u2019s largest telecom company, Safaricom.\nWhile a population accustomed to mobile money may seem like the perfect breeding group for mass Bitcoin adoption, there is already a functioning mobile payment system in place. Hence, for the average citizen, there is no real need for Bitcoin. Furthermore, Safaricom has been anything but friendly toward Bitcoin as it views it as a threat to MPesa. In 2015,\u00a0Safaricom cut off Bitcoin companies Kipochi and\u00a0BitPesa from using its services, thereby preventing bitcoin remittances being turned into local currency mobile money on their platform.\nBitPesa went to Kenya\u2019s high court to dispute Safaricom\u2019s decision. However, the high court ruled against BitPesa, and Safaricom will not be required to re-enable BitPesa\u2019s access to MPesa. Following the court ruling, the Central Bank of Kenya landed a further blow against Bitcoin adoption in East Africa\u2019s biggest economy when it issued a public warning stating, \u201cThe CBK reiterates that bitcoin and similar products are not legal tender nor are they regulated in Kenya. The public should, therefore, desist from transacting in bitcoin and similar products.\u201d\nAccording to Elizabeth Rossiello, CEO of BitPesa, the company still has live operations in Nigeria, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, with an average transaction size of $25,000 across all these countries.\n\u201cWe do have enterprise customers that themselves offer remittance products,\u201d Rossiello told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cbut we would not characterize our product itself as a \u2018retail remittance\u2019 product. Rather, BitPesa provides low-cost, robust, and efficient infrastructure for companies doing business and making transactions in African currencies, including wholesale remittance companies.\u201d\nWhile BitPesa is continuing to flourish as a business due to its focus on digital currency-based B2B payments across Africa (as opposed to private remittances,) the bitcoin remittances and wallet provider Kipochi was forced to cease its operations in Kenya and closed down.\nBitcoin Remittances in Ghana\nUnfortunately for Bitcoin, Kipochi is not the only startup in the African bitcoin remittance space that has struggled to succeed. The Ghana-based startup\u00a0Beam also failed to build a business based solely on bitcoin remittances in Africa.\nBeam launched its service in October 2014, with the aim to improve remittances into Ghana through the use of the Bitcoin network. However, less than a year later\u00a0Beam\u2019s management decided to cease its bitcoin remittance service. The reasons given for the closure were the complexity of bitcoin conversion into local currency, the limited number of merchants accepting bitcoin payments, and bitcoin\u2019s high price volatility.\nBeam has since changed its business model and now enables \u201cGhanaians in the diaspora to care for loved ones back home,\u201d by paying for school fees, utility bills, airtime minutes and even errands using an international debit or credit card.\nDespite the failures of Beam to bring bitcoin remittances to the masses in Ghana, local entrepreneurs have not given up on the idea. There are currently two Ghana-based e-money exchanges,\u00a0PMCedi and\u00a0PayPlux, that are accepting bitcoin as a means of payment and for the purposes of international money transfers.\nCashaa and the Sharing Economy\nLondon-based Bitcoin startup\u00a0Cashaa is the newest player entering the digital currency remittance market, and is in the process of launching its service after several months of successful beta testing of their platform.\nCashaa\u2019s business model differs from that of other bitcoin remittance startups as it is based on a peer-to-peer model involving local traders conducting fiat currency exchanges, while the digital currency aspect of the transaction happens in the background.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Cashaa Founder and CEO, Kumar Gaurav, suggested that Cashaa\u2019s advantage in the space lies in the company\u2019s business model. Because Cashaa is a \u201cpeer-to-peer marketplace that allows people to send money from one country to another or one city to another,\u201d rather than an actual bitcoin remittance company, it alleviates several of the challenges that bitcoin remittance companies have been facing in Africa. These challenges include the illiquidity of exchanges, country-specific regulations, KYC/AML requirements and the need for enough working capital to meet client liquidity needs. \u00a0\n\u201cThe reality is that when conducting country-to-country bitcoin remittances, you have to go through exchanges twice,\u201d said Guarav. \u201cFor example, if you want to conduct remittances from the U.S. to Ghana, you have to first change your fiat currency into bitcoin on a U.S. exchange, then send the bitcoin and then use a local exchange in Ghana to convert the bitcoins into Cedi. For the latter, however, liquidity is a big issue \u2026 as there is currently not near enough local demand for bitcoin. Hence, this type of business model has struggled and failed in the past.\u201d\nCashaa alleviates the liquidity and working capital requirement issues by partnering up with local exchanges, bitcoin ATMs and local cryptocurrency traders. Furthermore, Cashaa\u2019s platform is token-agnostic, which means Dash could be traded for Ethereum Classic, for example. As Cashaa is not linked solely to one digital currency, the company\u2019s future is not dependant on a single currency for its business to succeed.\nTo recruit digital currency traders that will utilize the Cashaa platform to facilitate remittances, Gaurav told Bitcoin Magazine that Cashaa intends to attract \u201cyoung people that can use their savings to buy and sell on the Cashaa exchange for a profit.\u201d Rather than having to buy and maintain a car to become an Uber driver, for example, \u201cpeople can raise $500 capital to start the business of becoming Cashaa trader. They can buy cryptocurrency cheaper at Cashaa and sell for a profit on local exchanges every time they handle a Cashaa transaction.\u201d\nCashaa is also currently targeting educated Uber and Ola drivers, who could earn more money by becoming digital currency traders. And as they are already transacting in cash, this makes them an excellent user base that can work as local collecting agents. The company is already testing this model in India.\n\u201cThe cryptocurrency traders that will handle the physical cash exchanges will be trained by Cashaa and can currently only become traders on an invite basis,\u201d said Guarav. \u201cFurthermore, a large part of future Cashaa cryptocurrency traders will be Uber and Ola drivers, which are already fully KYC-ed and are traceable.\u201d\nWill Bitcoin Remittances Finally Take Off in Africa?\nAs Bitcoin awareness and adoption is slowly growing in Africa, more remittances will likely start to take place using digital currencies. Considering that the average fee for money transfers to Africa is 12 percent and the average size of a transfer is $200, according to the World Bank, choosing digital currencies as a means of transferring money makes sense, given the low costs and the speed of the transactions. As the ecosystem matures and more companies experiment with ways to overcome current obstacles, Bitcoin may eventually begin to make inroads into the multi-billion dollar African remittance market.", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 13}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nAs last week\u2019s\u00a0Scaling Bitcoin workshops came to an end and its attendees returned home, the main task for 12 of Bitcoin\u2019s prominent lightning network developers was really just starting. Last Monday and Tuesday, representatives from\u00a0ACINQ,\u00a0Amiko Pay,\u00a0\u00a0BitFury,\u00a0Blockstream,\u00a0Lightning Labs and\u00a0Purse gathered on the third story of a working space in the center of Milan. Sitting around a table filled with humming laptops and emptied out pizza boxes, the world\u2019s first \u201clightning network summit\u201d took place.\nThe specific task at hand was to establish interoperability between the different implementations of what is perhaps the most highly anticipated technology to be rolled out on the Bitcoin blockchain in the near future.\nThe Lightning Network\nThe\u00a0lightning\u00a0network was first\u00a0proposed by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus \u201cTadge\u201d Dryja well over a year ago. Utilizing Bitcoin\u2019s basic programmable features \u2014 like multisig and time-locks \u2014 users can establish networked payment channels on top of Bitcoin, creating in effect an off-blockchain transaction layer leveraging Bitcoin\u2019s security. This should allow for a near-infinite amount of trustless, instant and low-cost transactions with little added burden on the Bitcoin network and its users.\n\u201cThe promise of this work is exceptional,\u201d long-time Linux kernel developer\u00a0Paul \u201cRusty\u201d Russell wrote in a 2015\u00a0blog entry, after examining Poon and Dryja\u2019s lightning network white paper.\nIt was this same Rusty Russell \u2014 now employed by Blockstream \u2014 that led important parts of the discussion in Milan. With his marker scribbling out proposed design specifications on a broad white sheet, the goal was to find common ground among the different teams. If all their implementations can connect and communicate with all the other implementations, utility of the lightning network will increase drastically.\n\u201cUnlike Bitcoin, where safety is having a gold standard implementation to minimize consensus surprises, lightning is strongest if we have multiple, independent implementations,\u201d Russell explained to Bitcoin Magazine.\n\u201cWe've seen a great deal of progress by the different groups experimenting and discovering problems and solutions. This is research and development in true open source style. We're now at the point where we've explored the landscape enough to make some decisions we feel will last. It\u2019s the perfect time to come together and combine our powers into a single spec that we can all aim for.\u201d\nHigh Stakes\nEver since the idea for the lightning network was first proposed, the stakes have increased significantly. Whereas Poon and Dryja mostly hoped to realize instant confirmations and affordable micro-transactions, over the last year the payment layer was hurled into the midst of a raging scaling debate. As a result, the lightning network is now often considered a centerpiece of Bitcoin Core\u2019s scalability\u00a0road map.\nBut the proposal has been receiving increased scrutiny as well. Over the past months in particular, questions have been raised about the effectiveness of proposed routing solutions, potential Denial of Service (DoS) vectors and other failure modes, as well as usability of a system that requires users to lock up some of their funds.\nTo help overcome these kinds of challenges, non-lightning specific companies like the\u00a0full-service Blockchain technology company, BitFury, and wallet provider and block explorer, Blockchain.info, have been investing resources to ensure the realization of the technology as well.\n\u201cAs with many new technologies, there may be challenges in practice that we have not yet experienced in testing,\u201d a representative from BitFury\u00a0told Bitcoin Magazine, regarding potential difficulties ahead. \u201cBut we believe we are completely prepared for the implementation of the lightning network and are working tirelessly with our partners to ensure implementation goes smoothly.\u201d\nScaling Bitcoin\nThe lightning network had already claimed center stage in the days prior to the summit at the Scaling Bitcoin conference itself. Three presentations on Saturday focused exclusively on the proposed scaling layer, while a workshop on lightning network routing continued later that afternoon.\nAt Scaling Bitcoin, Pavel Prikhodko, a developer with BitFury who has been researching routing solutions,\u00a0presented what is generally considered to be the most advanced transaction routing solution so far: Flare. Initial\u00a0tests of Flare were published by ACINQ a week earlier, with both ACINQ and BitFury professing to be happy with the results.\n\u201cFlare specifies how lightning network users may find routes to forward their payments through the network in a secure and decentralized manner,\u201d said BitFury. \u201cFlare is generally agreed upon in that it is a working solution for payment routing, and we are encouraged to see outside testing of the algorithm. We have found very favorable results in our internal tests, and are now working with the community to finalize the algorithm and to prepare it for medium-scale implementation.\u201d\nLightning Labs' Olaoluwa \u201cLaolu\u201d Osuntokun, in a different\u00a0presentation, explained how the lightning network can include the\u00a0Sphinx algorithm for Tor-style onion-routing. With Sphinx, each peer on the network knows from which other peer it \u201creceived\u201d a transaction, and to which peer that transaction must be \u201cforwarded.\u201d But peers don\u2019t know if they\u2019re the first step in the transaction chain, the last, or somewhere in between. They have no way of telling where a transaction originated or where it will end up. This would be a big boon for privacy, and is compatible with Flare as well as other routing solutions.\nLastly, Dryja proposed a solution to outsource important security measures. In the original lightning design, participants in lightning payment channels needed to monitor Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain to check if a counterparty was trying to cheat them. With Dryja\u2019s proposal, this task can be outsourced to a multitude of different peers. If even one of these peers notices the cheater \u2014 perhaps in exchange for a small fee \u2014 all funds are secured, and the cheater penalized. Furthermore, all this can be done while retaining full privacy, as the outsource service only gets to see an encrypted package.\nSummit Conclusions\nAfter two days of brainstorming, designing, discussion and some \u201chorse trading,\u201d as Russell put it, all teams managed to converge on a shared design. Over the next weeks, they will all plan to dig into their code to implement the Milan specification.\nEmerging from Tuesday evening with a shared sense of optimism, the developers now believe there will be trustless lightning transactions on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain sooner than many expected.\n\u201cAt the meeting and over the past months, Rusty and Christian Decker have been instrumental in contributing great work into low-level protocol design and specifications; without them, lightning would not be the same,\u201d said Joseph Poon \u2014 who now works with Lightning Labs \u2014 of the participating developers. \u201cLaolu and Tadge are doing critical fundamental work on the crypto design, and BitFury has been doing long-term thinking about payment routing. But really, there are too many people involved to mention. This is a growing team effort across many sectors of the Bitcoin ecosystem.\u201d\nRussell, too, said that he was impressed by the commitment of all the different teams as they came together to work on a shared specification.\n\u201cThere's a \u2026 pervasive feeling of a group of people trying to push their brains for two days to reach a common goal. It's pretty intense. Exhausting, but there was so little bullshit,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, until Christian started playing Rebecca Black videos for some reason. That kind of ended the second day.\u201d\nReal-world Use\nWhile there are still some open questions \u2014 especially regarding fee structures, countering DoS attacks, network topology and end-user experience \u2014 the teams expect early versions of the lightning network to be bootstrapped on top of the Bitcoin blockchain within months.\n\u201cA fully-functional lightning implementation without custodial trust would require a malleability fix \u2014 Segregated Witness \u2014 activated on main-net,\u201d Poon explained. \u201cAs soon as that\u2019s merged in, you should see users transacting on lightning.\u201d\nAccording to the BitFury representative, \"The BitFury Group is actively working on a lightning network wallet with a graphical user interface for desktop and mobile platforms, so users will be able to send lightning transactions to each other soon after the Bitcoin Blockchain is ready for it.\u201d\nFrom then on, real-world use of the technology can further inform developers to continue and improve the system. Since it\u2019s still hard to predict how the lightning network will be used exactly, or by whom, the developers in Milan agreed that some of the potential problems are best solved as they occur.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Amiko Pay\u2019s Corn\u00e9 Plooy explained that, as a second-layer solution, the lightning network is expected to be relatively flexible and future adjustments should be easy to implement.\n\u201cTechnology-wise, lightning has it easier than Bitcoin,\u201d Plooy said. \u201cBitcoin has this one-and-only blockchain, with its consensus rules that everybody has to agree on. But with lightning, the concept choices we made are probably \u2014 hopefully \u2014 not set in stone forever. We made an effort to not paint ourselves into a corner, and I think we are still in a flexible position, able to incorporate future developments as they occur.\u201d\nAn account of the post-Scaling Bitcoin meet-up by its participants can be found on their Medium post.\nNote: An earlier version of this article mistakenly attributed the comments from BitFury to Pavel Prikhodko rather than to a BitFury spokesperson. This post has been edited to amend the error.", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 18}

Since REP's launch, the\u00a0token has seen a great deal of popularity within the community and is positioned eighth on CoinCap\u2019s list of most valuable currencies.\nAugur is a decentralized prediction-market network and forecasting tool built on the Ethereum network. Using Ether or other digital currencies, users can participate in forecasting the outcomes of future real-world events, and are rewarded if they correctly predict those outcomes.\nMaking predictions through the trading of virtual shares is the essence of how Augur functions. For example, if a person predicts that the Ohio State Buckeyes will win the national championship, or that the stage show \u201cHamilton\u201d will win an Oscar, then that person would purchase \u201cshares\u201d in those outcome. If these shares align with the eventual outcomes, then the holder will reap a return.\nAugur\u2019s groundbreaking decentralized network of oracles allows participants to report on event outcomes via Augur\u2019s prediction-market platform and earn REP \u2014 1/22-millionth of all market trading fees \u2014 in exchange for providing Augur with accurate and reliable information on those outcomes. The more oracles there are participating in the platform, the more reliable the reported outcomes will be.\nThis model follows the main tenet articulated in James Surowiecki\u2019s bestselling book The Wisdom of Crowds, which states that the quality of group predictions typically exceed those of individuals. This model, therefore, makes prediction markets\u2019 forecasts more accurate than those offered by individual efforts, surveys or traditional opinion polling.\nTony Sakich, director of marketing for Augur, says that while there definitely have been hurdles with the launch, things overall have been remarkably smooth with REP distribution. \u201cThe support inquiries we had were almost entirely all user errors.\u201d\nSakich said that after REP was released, many questions began pouring in from followers of the project and from the media. The feedback, he says, has been very positive. Now that the tokens are in the hands of Augur supporters, Sakich says that it is up to the markets to decide the value and interest in the project.\n\u201cWe have tried to stay in contact through Slack and Reddit, and are grateful for the interest and support. People were excited to be able to access their REP, so we know that getting the network live will help, as it\u2019s an important milestone.\u201d\nTo ensure the security of the platform, Augur\u2019s core developer, Joey Krug, has announced that Augur\u2019s code would comply with NASA and the Jet Propulsion Lab's coding guidelines, and with the Motor Industry Software Reliability Association guidelines. It also will encompass other various recommendations that were made after The DAO hack. These guidelines were created to ensure the safest possible software, and to support an efficient auditing process through the use of simple and secure code.\nAccording to Sakich, Augur\u2019s ultimate goal has been\u00a0to launch an easy-to-use and attractive front end while offering the most thorough security process possible. \u201cWe will continue to provide updates on the progress of the project on /r/augur and on our social media channels. We also encourage everyone to check out our GitHub to review our code, make contributions and track Augur\u2019s project.\u201d\nBusinesses in the community have also been responding. \u00a0In the days preceding the distribution, both Kraken and Poloniex announced that they would support REP on their exchanges beginning on the first day of launch. \u201cAs far as I know, this is the first time two major exchanges announced support of a token before its distribution,\u201d said Sakich. REP is now also supported by the Bittrex and Coincheck digital currency exchanges.\n\u201cAdditionally, MyEtherWallet.com and Jaxx both supported REP tokens in the first three days of trading,\u201d said Sakich, adding that Mist, Ledger Nano S and any other Ethereum wallet that can support tokens can accept also REP.\nJaxx was the first multi-platform wallet to offer REP on all of its nine platforms. Access to REP via Jaxx allows users to manage these tokens in one place, while providing more convenient and fluid access for users to enter prediction markets.\nSays Anthony Di Iorio, CEO of Jaxx: \u201cAugur is a genius concept. We are extremely excited to be integrating REP because it's been surging in growth since it entered beta and is now becoming a hot commodity \u2026 We have developed a great friendship with the team at Augur and are looking forward to providing our customer base with the most user-friendly way to manage their REP on computer, device or phone.\u201d\nThe digital asset exchange ShapeShift\u00a0also made a rapid move to integrate the token. Through the inclusion of REP on ShapeShift, software developers as well as everyday users can instantly exchange between REP and assets such as BTC or ETH.\n\u201cDecentralized prediction markets are one of the most important applications to derive from blockchain technology,\u201d said ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees in a statement. \u201cAugur has pioneered and popularized the concept and we\u2019re honored to support REP on ShapeShift from day one.\u201d\n\u201cShapeShift is known throughout the crypto space as one of the best services for digital asset users,\u201d said Sakich. \u201cNew users will have an incredibly easy-to-use method to convert cryptocurrencies into REP tokens and vice versa. It\u2019s wonderful to have such an easy tool to recommend novice users who are interested in REP for the first time.\u201d\n", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 21}

Now, the company is in the throes of a complementary project that has garnered the attention of entrepreneurs and developers throughout the Bitcoin community.\nBcoin, as it is affectionately called, is a newly developed JavaScript library that offers a new way to connect to the Bitcoin network. While Bcoin is not the first library in the high-level programming language, it is the first to include full node capabilities. In Bcoin \u2014 as opposed to another Bitcoin JavaScript library, bitcoinjs \u2014 tasks like blockchain verification don\u2019t need to be offloaded to third parties. In other words, no other nodes need to be trusted to confirm the valid chain.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Purse CTO and Bcoin lead developer Christopher Jeffrey explained:\n\"When I was working at BitPay, we were looking for a \u2018hackable\u2019 Bitcoin back-end to do cool things with. I wanted access to lower level features than the Bitcoin Core API allowed, but a pull-request to make that possible was rejected, so I was left with few options. After I left BitPay, I turned to an old project I was a contributor to: Bcoin. Over the course of a year, I turned a simplified payment verification library into a full node library.\u201d\nNow, Bcoin is getting ready for \u201cprime time,\u201d as Purse will start running its service on top of it.\n\u201cBcoin will be used as Purse's full node and wallet back-end,\u201d Jeffrey explained. \u201cIt should be live within the next week. This means Bcoin will be responsible for securing actual money and will be battle-tested by us for anyone considering using it.\"\nA Viable Bitcoin Core Alternative?\nWhile Bitcoin Core has been vetted over time, and for many still serves as the go-to standard, the code base can be a bit challenging to work with, even for experienced software engineers. As a result, only a small cadre of developers are fully conversant with it and actively contribute to its advancement.\nJeffrey\u2019s efforts to create Bcoin should simplify some of the complexities associated with managing a large and rapidly growing merchant website.\n\"Bcoin is my answer to the Bitcoin development problem. I think it will be the right answer for a lot of people. JavaScript is a ubiquitous language: everyone is familiar with it and it runs everywhere, including the browser,\u201d Jeffrey told Bitcoin Magazine.\nBut not everyone agrees that Bcoin is an enrichment to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Concerns about Bcoin have been raised among some other developers in the Bitcoin community.\nBitcoin Core developer Peter Todd is perhaps the most outspoken critic. He told Bitcoin Magazine that rewriting the consensus code is a nice way to learn the protocol, but ultimately is a waste of money for a business.\n\u201cMy views about this are typical of those of competent, experienced Bitcoin developers who believe that rewriting the consensus code and getting it right is spectacularly difficult, and no one has been successful at doing so,\u201d Todd said. \u201cEqually, the Satoshi Bitcoin code base is well optimized and very fast; you're not going to do better than that in JavaScript anyway.\u201d\nTodd went on to say that like it or not, consensus has incredibly strict requirements on compatibility. \u201cYou need 100% compatibility down to the tiniest minute details.\u201d This, he says, is a unique requirement that simply doesn't exist in nearly all other projects. \u201cIf you're web-browser, no-one cares because layouts differ only by a few pixels. On the other hand, if your account balance and my account balance differ by even a single satoshi, then that's a huge problem that simply must be fixed. Otherwise it won't be clear who owns what money.\u201d\nSatoshi\nChristopher Jeffrey acknowledged that a mentality around the infeasibility of a consensus protocol re-implementation has existed since the very early days of Bitcoin. Even Satoshi Nakamoto once predicted that an alternative implementation would act as a \u201cmenace to the network.\u201d\nJeffrey says the goal isn\u2019t to upstage Satoshi or to become problematic to the network, nor to establish a position in the block-size debate. Through the accelerated development of his new implementation, he hopes to debunk the notion that it is impossible to re-implement consensus code.\n\"Whoever Satoshi was, he was very smart, but he was not a programmer. He left us with an absolute mess of a project. That project has been further hacked together over the years to make it even more haphazard. The code is unreadable, the API is arbitrarily designed, and it's not very easy to fix all of that unless you start fresh. Consensus code is very difficult to re-implement, but not impossible. The criticisms of re-implemented consensus code do have some merit. That being said, most of the critics are too dismissive.\"", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 19}

His investment framework consisted of investing in companies that had low margins but could scale easily.\nOne audience member asked what he would do in a situation where margins went to zero or even negative. Many blockchain application businesses fall into this category. Part of his response was that due to quantitative easing (aka money printing) money was free, so investing in businesses with zero or negative gross margins can be done. If rates are more negative than the cash flow burn of the company, in our bizarro world, the investment actually is outperforming.\nWhen asked how his thesis would be impacted if interest rates rose, he responded that in the near future, that wouldn\u2019t happen \u2014 and even if it did, policy makers would realize their error and quickly revert back to printing gobs of money.\nWhenever someone completely dismisses the possibility that a central tenet of their investment thesis could be invalid, alarm bells should ring. During the 2003\u20132007 U.S. subprime housing bubble, the common refrain was that housing prices NEVER went down. By 2008, that central tenet of faith was proven grossly erroneous.\nCentral banks over the past 25 years have conditioned investors to expect lower interest rates every time there is a financial hiccup. In 1990, the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yielded 7.94 percent; today it yields 1.75 percent. The effect of falling interest rates has pushed investors further out on the risk curve to generate stable income.\nA Thought Experiment\nBitcoin/blockchain startups primarily fund themselves by selling equity to investors, by issuing tokens through Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), or through retained earnings (assuming the company is profitable). Most startups in the early stages sell equity.\nAssume you are an angel investor and you share the worldview of the aforementioned speaker. Essentially, you invest in scalable Bitcoin/blockchain businesses with the hope that a greater fool will emerge, allowing you to exit your investment.

Here are some assumptions about your investing strategy:\n\nInitial post-money valuation: $5 million.\nYears to exit: Seven.\nYour portfolio\u2019s performance is benchmarked against owning high-yield U.S. corporate bonds. While many think that money is \u201cfree\u201d, it definitely is not unless you are a AAA-rated developed market corporation. Everyone else must pay to play.\n\nAs an example, let\u2019s use the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Effective Yield as a proxy for what an investor can earn buying riskier corporate bonds. Investing in startups is infinitely riskier than buying high-yield corporate bonds, as these companies produce actual cash flow.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis publishes the historical effective annualized yield. The table below lists current and historical annualized yields for the index.\n\nThe majority of the startups that you invest in will die within seven years, and you will lose 100 percent of the money invested. A small percent will exit at a valuation that is several times higher. Your performance depends on your ability to pick winners.\nBreakeven Success Rate = (1 + Opportunity Cost) / (1 + Exit Return)\nBreakeven Success Rate: The success rate at which you are indifferent to investing in startups versus buying high-yield US corporate bonds\nSuccess Rate: Defined as the percentage of startups in your portfolio that complete a successful exit\nOpportunity Cost: The seven-year compounded return of the high-yield index\nExit Return: The return generated after the startup has completed an exit\nExit Return = (Initial Valuation / Final Valuation) \u2013 1\nThe below table lists the Breakeven Success Rate under different scenarios\n\nIt is hard to pin down the global average exit valuation for startups. From various articles I have read, startups on average exit with valuations between $50 million and $100 million. If we assume bond yields normalize near 10 percent per annum, nine percent to 19 percent of your startup portfolio must successfully exit. Even in the current \u201clow\u201d interest rate environment, you still must be a very skilled investor to break even (eight percent to 15 percent success rate).\nAchieving a $50 million+ exit valuation is no easy task. Most likely after your angel / seed investment, the company will subsequently attempt to raise a Series A and then B round to grow into a juicy acquisition target. Most likely after each round, your equity stake will be diluted.\nThe below table reproduces the breakeven success rate, assuming each successful startup does two subsequent financing rounds and existing investors are diluted 20 percent in each round.\n\nInstead of achieving a nine percent to 19 percent success rate, you now must achieve a 15 percent to 29 percent success rate if interest rates normalize. Remember, you are only breaking even. For all the hard work of identifying promising startups and mentoring them, you have not generated outsized returns. Wouldn\u2019t it be much easier to log onto Interactive Brokers and buy a high-yield bond ETF?\nBecause you invest in companies with low to zero gross margins, your only hope is to pass the hot potato onto investors who are more risk-seeking than yourself. You have no expectation of dividend income. As interest rates rise, the universe of assets that yield high returns with less risk grows. The pool of fools will decline, and your portfolio will struggle to break even versus investing in a basket of high-yield corporate bonds.\nThere are many Bitcoin/blockchain businesses and business models that generate real revenue, and are defensible. One only has to look at Bitfinex to see how profitable a \u201cproperly\u201d run Bitcoin exchange can be. For the full year 2015, Bitfinex generated $7.03 million of Net Income on $9.35 million of revenue.\nDo The Twist\nThe Bank of Japan was the first central bank to explicitly target a steeper yield curve. In a recent speech, Federal Reserve Governor, Eric Rosengren, stated that the Fed should engineer a steeper yield curve. Many financial analysts are calling this new form of yield curve targeting a \u201cReverse Operation Twist.\u201d The original \u201cOperation Twist\u201d involved the Fed buying long-dated bonds and selling short-dated ones in order to lower long-term interest rates.\nBanks need a steep yield curve to make money. After printing money to stave off insolvency of commercial banks, central banks must now steepen the yield curve so that their stakeholders can return to profitability. The effects of a steeper yield curve are already working. JP Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs have all reported impressive 3Q16 earnings.\nAs yields on the long-end rise, it will be easier to find positive yielding investments that are not as risky as the strategy of punting startups that have no plan to ever generate a profit.\nThis op-ed is a guest post by Arthur Hayes.

Throughout the vibrant, creative internet communities that fuel the development and deployment of distributed ledgers, along with many of the empowering technologies that are emerging, according to Golumbia.\n\u201c[The] kinds of false, angry, other-targeting ideologies on which the Trump phenomenon depends can be readily found in all the kinds of online communities that create and promote the frightening range of right-wing political action we see everywhere today,\u201d says Golumbia in the blog post. \u201cWe should be very worried about Trump, and we should be worried about how Bitcoin and other parts of online discourse feed the hate and studied ignorance that make so many people support him.\u201d\nThe book doesn\u2019t mention Trump, but is explicit in condemning the Libertarian (or cyber-Libertarian) aspiration to personal autonomy, self-ownership and freedom \u2014 as much freedom as possible \u2014 from the power, greed and control freakery of overreaching central authorities.\n\u201c[In] the name of [Bitcoin], extremist ideas were gaining far more traction than they previously had outside of the extremist literature to which they had largely been confined,\u201d says the author. \u201cThese ideas are not simply heterodox or contrarian: They are pieces of a holistic worldview that have been deliberately developed and promulgated by right-wing ideologues.\u201d\nThis is not to say that Golumbia\u2019s book isn\u2019t well written. It is, in fact, a masterpiece of sophistry that carefully builds up subtly constructed distortions of simple concepts like \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201ccontrol,\u201d in the hope of persuading the reader that real freedom can only come from a \u201cbenevolent\u201d Big Brother that controls each and every aspect of life from the cradle to the grave. Sounds absurd? Sure it is, like those funny mathematical \u201cdemonstrations\u201d that \u00a0prove 1 equals 0.\nOf course, one can\u2019t assume that all readers are stupid and totally ignorant of facts. Therefore, Golumbia is forced to concede that not all Bitcoin enthusiasts are extreme right-wingers. \u201cI am sometimes asked to account for Bitcoin enthusiasm among those with explicitly left-wing politics,\u201d he acknowledges in the book. But Golumbia finds it hard to see how the \u201cminority\u201d of non-right-wing Bitcoin enthusiasts can resist \u201cthe political values that are very literally coded into the software itself.\u201d\nIn the post, Golumbia vents his frustration at the growing Bitcoin enthusiasm from the mainstream left. In the video of the Connectivity session at the Clinton Foundation\u2019s Clinton Global Initiative 2016 conference, two speakers \u2014 former special assistant to President Obama, Jamie Smith, now Global Chief Communications Officer of the Bitfury Group, and Peruvian economist, Hernando de Soto \u2014 talk about \u201cthe tantalizing future of the blockchain\u201d (around minute 32). Golumbia seems especially upset that De Soto is praised not only by George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan, but also by Hillary and Bill Clinton (who called De Soto \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest living economist,\u201d) and denounces the Clintons as \u201cleft neoliberals.\u201d Part of Golumbia\u2019s full-on attack is based on \u201chow easily and how transparently [Bitcoin] fits into the shift toward the right we see in so many places today.\u201d\nIn a Twitter exchange with another political pundit, with whom this writer has had many disagreements and intense exchanges over the years, Golumbia extends his condemnation to all sorts of emerging, disruptive and empowering technologies. It\u2019s difficult to escape the conclusion that Golumbia\u2019s opposition to Bitcoin and its associated technologies has its roots in a preconceived and flawed partisan position.", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 18}

When independent, trendy fashion label Babyghost teamed up with Shanghai-based Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) company, BitSE, and its VeChain\u00a0project, the result was a multidimensional sensory feast for the fashion crowd.\nFor Babyghost\u2019s 2017 Spring and Summer collection, the brand took to the streets to create a new twist. While still incorporating Babyghost\u2019s core influences, this collection also draws on inspiration from the new age trope of the Indigo Child \u2014 the concept of an evolved group of children that embody intelligence, intuition, and supernatural abilities. Uniting with VeChain, Babyghost is now taking their fashion line one step further by providing a link between fashion and the digital world.\nVeChain\u00a0is a cloud product management solution integrated with blockchain technology that puts unique IDs on the blockchain and can verify if an item is genuine or not. It focuses on four areas: anti-counterfeiting, supply chain management, asset management, and client experiences, each of which can be used independently or synergistically.\nThe result of this union is called FashTech, where a clothing collection can be verified on the blockchain through Near Field Communications (NFC) \u2014 which allows devices to communicate with one another when brought into close proximity \u00a0\u2014 or by scanning the QR code on the label. A person\u2019s phone communicates with the small VeChain chip embedded inside the clothing or accessory, which then tells its \u201cstory\u201d to the consumer.\nThe chip holds a unique public and private key pair. The public key is also stored in the blockchain\u00a0and\u00a0can be verified by the VeChain app. The app then verifies the public key with the VeChain servers to determine if the public key is genuine. As a result, product safety and quality assurance are maintained, helping to drive customer satisfaction.\nWith the help of VeChain, Babyghost reaches an elevated level of interaction with their customers through their garments. At Shanghai\u2019s Fashion Week, VeChain and Babyghost presented 20 models who told the stories of 20 new looks.\nEmbedded with a VeChain chip, those in attendance at the event had the unique opportunity to simply scan the chip on each piece of clothing to receive an interactive memory of who had originally modeled the piece in NYC. Later on, should future customers want to document that they also wore the piece of clothing before selling it secondhand, it would also be possible to provide this interactive memory, according to BitSE.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, BitSE COO Sunny Lu said that Babyghost is ready to try any innovation that will give their customers extraordinary experiences.\n\u201cThis event illustrates that fashion brands, especially high fashion brands, need to keep the consumer in mind and give them more than a product,\u201d said Lu. \u201cThe customer wants to know that the connection between them and the brand is real, and that their products are real.\u201d\nAlso presented at the event were 80 eco-friendly handbags that had 80 different stories to tell because of their unique VeChain IDs. Tagged with one of 80 landmark Babyghost photos, each handbag has its own \u201csoul\u201d representing a specific moment in Babyghost history.\nThis successful collaboration proves that blockchain can be disruptive to more than just finance, said Lu.\n\u201cCurrently, some players in the fashion industry are using NFC as an anti-counterfeiting solution,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, these aren\u2019t the most advanced chips, and they only solve one \u00a0of the many problems that the fashion industry faces ... these chips still have potential security risks and concerns.\u201d\nThe disruptive difference of VeChain comes from the use of blockchain technology, which creates an opportunity for everyone to be involved in the business operations, including consumers, without introducing any security concerns, adds Lu.\nBy simply scanning the VeChain chip on a cardigan, dress or shirt, a customer has the opportunity to access a personal digital adventure revealing information about their piece and its journey.\nNot only that, customers will be interacting with blockchain technology without even knowing that it\u2019s working behind the scenes.\n\u201cThe industry players will know how everything works, but the end consumer doesn\u2019t need to know, which is why this use case is so beautiful,\u201d said Lu. \u201cThe primary concern for the customer is the user interface and value, which this technology brings to them.\u201d\nThis experience gives consumers a real sense of what FashTech is. It\u2019s not simply a case of putting lights on clothing: It\u2019s about connecting software, hardware, a tangible item and the user to something much more than that.\nAs Lu says, the world is seeing a paradigm shift in a lot of industries from mass production to mass customization.\n\u201cWe want to be a part of that [and] VeChain provides an exclusive and personalized experience to the clients of Babyghost,\u201d he said.\nView a series of videos featuring Babyghost's new FashTech collection here.", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 18}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nFor many, the level of centralization found in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem is the biggest issue for the peer-to-peer digital cash system today. As a technology that relies on decentralization in order to provide a censorship-resistant bearer ecash, any trend towards centralization should be viewed as problematic.\nIn 2014, economist Kevin Dowd claimed the incentives of pooled mining are \u201ctotally destructive of the Bitcoin system.\u201d The amount of mining that takes place in China led former Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn to state, \u201cBitcoin is controlled by the Chinese Government.\u201d\nThose who believe bitcoin mining is far too centralized mainly point to factors such as ASIC hardware, where mining takes place, and various mining strategies as the main drivers behind this perceived centralization. In a recent presentation, Bloq Economist Paul Sztorc explained how the problems associated with bitcoin mining centralization may be overstated.\n\u201cMining is, in my view, the single new puzzle piece that makes it all work, but Bitcoin is protected by a lot of awesome things that were created way before mining,\u201d said Sztorc.\nEfficient Miners Secure the Network\nOne of the key points made by Sztorc during his presentation is that miners will always look to mine bitcoin in the most efficient manner possible. The reason much of the mining happens in China is the same reason that miners choose to use hardware specifically designed to find the next block reward.\n\u201cThey\u2019re [both] just the same complaint about efficiency,\u201d said Sztorc. \u201cAll miners must efficiency-maximize or they get fired by the protocol. And efficiency improvements are good because they support the network with a higher hashrate.\u201d\nAccording to Sztorc, the fact that mining takes place in China actually makes it harder for Bitcoin to be attacked. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have miners in China, it would be cheaper to attack Bitcoin \u2014 potentially much cheaper to attack Bitcoin from China,\u201d he said.\nSztorc\u2019s point is that mining takes place in China because it is much more efficient to mine there. This helps to protect the Bitcoin network through an increased overall hashrate for the network. It costs much more to attack the network because miners have become increasingly specialized over the years in terms of the hardware they use and where they decide to use that hardware.\nEveryone Will Use the Best Strategies\nMiners can also use alternative strategies in an effort to increase their revenues at the expense of other miners on the network. In late 2013, Cornell\u2019s Ittay Eyal and Emin G\u00fcn Sirer claimed the existence of one mining strategy, known as \u201cselfish mining,\u201d meant Bitcoin is fundamentally broken.\nSztorc disagrees. \u201c[With selfish mining], if everyone copies the strategy, you end up right back where you were before minus some headache of going through this process,\u201d he stated during his presentation.\nWithout getting into the technical details, selfish mining is a strategy that involves a miner being selective about when they publish a new block they\u2019ve found. A miner can essentially trick other miners into wasting their hashing power by not informing them about the longest chain. This leads to bigger profits for the selfish miner, and it may also lead to other miners joining the selfish miner\u2019s pool, thus providing that group of miners with a greater share of the network hashrate.\nAccording to Sztorc, the problem with this theory is that miners have an incentive to use the most efficient mining strategies possible. Much like it makes sense for miners to use ASIC hardware and operate in locations with cheap electricity, it would also make sense for every miner to implement selfish mining if it were the most efficient option.\n\u201cPeople will continue to backstab each other until they\u2019re [back where they started],\u201d explained Sztorc. \u201cAt which point, everyone might realize that they\u2019ve only harmed themselves and they\u2019ll stop doing this altogether. In reality, of course, nobody would even bother trying this.\u201d\nSztorc added that best practices will be copied by other miners, and users are the ones who benefit via a higher network hashrate.\nWhat Can Miners Even Do with Their Centralization?\nOne last thing to remember when it comes to bitcoin mining centralization is that miners aren\u2019t able to do much with the supposed power that comes via that centralized control. An individual miner is only able to filter transactions in the blocks they mine, while a miner or pool of miners with control of more than 50 percent of the network hashrate can filter or reorder transactions.\n\u201cWith 51 percent, miners can attempt to reorder or refilter transactions in the immediate past at tremendous cost and risk,\u201d explained Sztorc. \u201cIf the attack fails, which it might for a couple of reasons \u2014 double agents, bad luck, [or] manual intervention \u2014 then the attacking miners lose and the rival miners win.\u201d\n\u201cAn even greater risk is that the attack succeeds and all of the mining equipment loses all of its value,\u201d added Sztorc.\nIn Sztorc\u2019s view, any sort of attack by miners is countered by the fact that Bitcoin developers and users can always change the proof-of-work hash function, which is essentially a firing of the entire mining community.\nAttack vectors for miners will be even less prevalent once privacy and anonymity improvements are added to Bitcoin. Sztorc also sees Layer 2 protocols, such as the Lightning Network, as improvements that will further weaken miners\u2019 control over Bitcoin.\n\u201cMiners have a very low ability to be mean to us,\u201d said Sztorc. \u201cThere\u2019s just not a lot they can do. The only things they can do are so unprofitable that they\u2019re extraordinarily unlikely to ever be incentive-compatible.\u201d\n\u201cLife is tough for the miners,\u201d Sztorc concluded.", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 26}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nUkraine is one of these countries where people require no explanation about the value of hard money. As war in the east of the post-Soviet nation helped put its economy into a recession, the Ukrainian national currency \u2014 the hryvnia \u2014 lost some 70 percent of its value over the past two years. Perhaps that\u2019s why demand for bitcoin there has\u00a0increased significantly.\nAnd also why the\u00a0Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference in Kiev on September 23 attracted a large and engaged audience.\nThe Bitcoin Alternative\nEarly in the morning, at the start of the conference,\u00a0Cubits COO Max Krupyshev addressed a packed Rookie Hall, one of the three spacious conference rooms. Going over the basics of blocks, Bitcoin-addresses and proof-of-work in his native Ukrainian, Krupyshev faced a crowd full of questions and requests for details.\n\u201cThe audience engagement at this conference is really impressive,\u201d Krupyshev told Bitcoin Magazine after his talk. \u201cPeople here are really curious about Bitcoin and blockchain technology. They\u2019re not passive or bored listeners. [They] actually want to know how it works and what it does, asking questions accordingly.\u201d\nKrupyshev believes Ukrainians may be looking at technologies like Bitcoin, blockchain and other distributed ledgers as a potential alternative to their current economic situation.\n\u201cUkraine has fallen on tough times, economically and financially. Many people may be considering Bitcoin as a potential way out, maybe as a hedge against inflation, but perhaps also to hide money, or to send money abroad, or as an investment \u2014 or as a job opportunity. Wages in this country are low. Among the few people making good money are programmers. If you live here and learn to understand this upcoming technology, it may present an opportunity to improve your style of life.\u201d\nThe Conference\nThe Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference in Kiev is one of a series of four in Eastern Europe in 2016. Conference organizer\u00a0Smile Expo also hosts events in Prague, St. Petersburg and Moscow, with the\u00a0next edition in the Russian capital on November 10th.\nLast Friday\u2019s conference was the third annual edition in Kiev. And as Eastern European interest in Bitcoin and blockchain technology keeps on growing, so does the conference in Ukraine.\nPavel Likhomanov is coordinator of the Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Likhomanov explained:\n\u201cBitcoin, blockchain and fintech is gaining popularity in Eastern Europe in general, and in Ukraine in particular. We can see this increasing interest at the conference as well. Last year we had some 400 visitors; now we\u2019re up to almost 600.\u201d\nThe conference in Kiev is mostly targeted at locals, with most speakers addressing their audience in Ukrainian. English speakers are few and far between, and have translators to help them get their message out to the attendees in Kiev.\nTopics in the conference rooms, meanwhile, are as diverse as you\u2019ll find them in this industry. They include advanced explanations of the proposed Casper proof-of-stake consensus mechanism for Ethereum; the value proposition of bitcoin as part of an investment portfolio; and the importance of cold storage.\nLikhomanov explained:\n\u201cVisitors of the conference come for different reasons, and we aim to satisfy all interests. As such, the topics discussed here are diverse as well. This is why we have three distinct tracks: the Professional Hall, targeted at business professionals; the Developer Hall that covers the really technical side of things; and the Rookie Hall, where new people can come and learn about these technologies.\u201d\nUkraine\u2019s International Contribution\nDespite the growing interest, most bitcoiners will probably not identify Ukraine as an international powerhouse of the industry.\nNotably absent from the conference in Kiev is\u00a0Ghash.IO\u00a0\u00a0and its mother company\u00a0CEX.IO. Once Bitcoin\u2019s biggest mining pool and an industry leader, this business with Ukrainian roots is today incorporated in the United Kingdom.\nAnd Krupyshev, while the original founder of the\u00a0Ukrainian Bitcoin Foundation, moved to Berlin to work for Cubits over a year ago. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, he explained that his departure may be a bit of a trend.\n\u201cUkrainians are clever. There are plenty of talented developers with coding skills and entrepreneurs with good ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut unfortunately, Ukrainian venture capitalists still live in the old world. While Twitter is valued at one billion US dollars, investors here still want to see tangible products. It\u2019s crazy. On top of that, the legal situation is murky. Bitcoin is not illegal...but it\u2019s not necessarily legal either. No one really knows. This uncertainty and lack of investment is driving Ukrainian developers and companies abroad.\u201d\nIndeed, several of the Ukrainian speakers and sponsors in Kiev do represent familiar names in the Bitcoin and blockchain industry, like\u00a0Ambisafe,\u00a0ether.camp\u00a0or\u00a0Bitmain Warranty.\n\u201cWe have a bigger footprint in the industry than, I think, many people probably realize,\u201d said Krupyshev. \u201cBut the real activity is hidden, working for or even disguised as foreign outfits. If you look more closely you\u2019ll find there\u2019s a lot of Ukrainian developers and executives working abroad \u2014 at least officially.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 27}

He noted how, on that trip, he knew of two or three companies that were interested in the technology; after six months, governments and banks were taking notice. Now the space is diversified.\nButerin said that people were \"now beginning to realize the possibilities we thought of in 2014.\"\nHe made a comparison to the internet, saying there's \"not one annual conference where people decide the internet.\"\n\"Once it grows big enough, it naturally grows diverse,\" Buterin said.\nWangxiang Announces 200 Billion RMB Investment\nLooking to grow development, Wangxiang's Feng Xiao announced a 200 billion RMB investment in a \"smart city\" and development center near Hangzhou, the recent host city to the G20 and B20 summits and home to headquarters of Alibaba, China's largest online commerce company.\nFeng said the city will have the capacity to house 90,000 people with lifestyle, traffic and services interconnected digitally.\nHe said the city will also encompass development and production resources to cover \"the whole lifecycle of manufacturing,\" with incubators and accelerators. \u00a0\nChina's NIFA, Hyperledger and IBM on Regulation\nA common theme centered on working with regulatory commissions, both in China and in the West.\nThe day's talks were opened by Lihui Li of China's National Internet Finance Association, the highest level national, industrial, self-regulatory organization.\nLihui noted that much of the fintech surrounding blockchain must be adapted for use in China, saying a high frequency, cross-platform, decentralized blockchain is \"clearly not suitable,\" and that private and alliance chains want a version with a \"multiple-center distributed structure.\"\n\"The application of new technology in the financial industry should not be decentralized,\" Lihui said.\nBrian Behlendorf of Hyperledger and the Linux Foundation stressed building common platforms. He noted that there will be \"many public chains, and millions of private chains,\" so the more common the code underlying them, \"the better for everyone.\"\nAmong them, he noted Hyperledger's backing of the Apache license. \"The Apache license is something that puts lawyers at ease,\" Behlendorf said.\nJohn Wolpert of IBM looked forward to blockchain tech cutting waste in dispute resolution. He said it currently takes 44 days to resolve disputes, and estimated they could cut that by 75 percent by moving companies to blockchain, which he called \"the internet of transactions.\"\nProject Bletchley: Filling in \"Missing Pieces\" of Security\nMarley Gray of Microsoft discussed Project Bletchley, which aims to offer distributed applications on Azure's cloud platform.\n\"Blockchain has some missing pieces,\" Gray said. He noted businesses' concerns over security and separating logic and execution at the proper levels. He gave an example of a derivative pricing algorithm on which partners agree, but the algorithm can remain secret. Gray said that \"tools need to be improved and operations need to be added.\"\nJoseph Lubin: ConsenSys Tackles Personal Identity Issues\nAside from financial tech, Consensys founder Joseph Lubin discussed longer-range implications of Ethereum and other blockchains, including personal identity.\nEarlier in the week one of the company's projects, Uport, won the Demo Day with its implementation of secure personal identity on the blockchain. He said Uport and Consensys' Regis identification and authentication system hold promise for individuals. \u00a0\"In developing countries, it's even more powerful,\" he said.\n\"You can use it to bootstrap your own identity and develop your reputation, enabling them to become enfranchised in this world\".\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Lubin addressed KYC/AML uses, saying that with adoption of these systems, companies \"don't have to worry about, is this person 21? or does this person live in this jurisdiction?\"\nHe said that ConsenSys is speaking with different central banks, regulators and quasi-governmental organizations on this.\nCircle: \"Killer Behaviors\"\nSpeaking on personal payment transactions, Circle's Jeremy Allaire and Sean Deville discussed their company's focus on messaging, and looked forward to standards in sending money.\n\"We're talking about behaviors, and mobile messaging is the killer behavior,\" Deville said.\nAllaire noted how China already has widespead adoption of mobile-based personal payments, and told the audience, \"We think the Chinese consumer is going to play a much bigger role in the world economy.\"\nHe said the domestic Chinese market is already dominated, so Circle China's focus is on cross-border payments.\nThe two also looked forward to interoperability between different payment networks.\n\"We don't want to build another closed system. I think we'll see a world where if you use Alipay, you can send money to PayPal, which can send money to Circle,\" Allaire said.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Deville stressed the need for protocols to address sending money.\u00a0\"There isn't an HTTP of money yet,\" he said.\nBut with that, he noted the need for government institutions to embrace the idea as a whole.\n\"Regulators have the task of coming up to speed and not holding back innovation,\" Deville said, calling for flexibility in working with new developments in transactions and payments. He said the UK and Japan are particularly forward-thinking in this regard.\nDeville also remarked on the overall feel of the conference.\n\"It still has a connection to its roots,\" he said. Besides the growth in business aspects in discussion, \"developers are talking about core technical issues.\"\nBHP Billiton's Project Rai Stone: Closing the Day with a Bang\nToward the end of Blockchain Summit's opening day, Tyler Smith of the global mining giant BHP Billiton received one of the most enthusiastic ovations of the day after announcing and demonstrating how his company's blockchain software was able to handle the documenting of natural resource samples.\u00a0\nToday, he said, such specimens, some of which are valued at up to $100 million each.\u00a0are inefficiently tracked by email and spreadsheets. That system involves a lot of faith in the supply chain. Smith was able to show how his blockchain solution could pin down delivery and and improve accountability.\nSmith said that BHP's Project Rai Stone software starts with a contract for the sample that's sent down to the extraction rig, creating accountability and a chain of order requests that connects laboratories, analysts and engineers.\nThe software was developed to work directly on the Ethereum blockchain, in partnership with ConsenSys.\nSmith also noted data reporting commitments to governments regulators, which he said has given rise to a multimillion dollar industry \"that gathers public information to make a database and put a bow on it.\u201d He invited peers to create a consortium to publish the data, saying it would address compliance issues and expedite data sharing while eliminating redundancies.\n\"We can do this with all counties in the world, at the same time, on the same blockchain,\" Smith said.\nHe said Project Rai Stone will go live this year.\nTomorrow: Highlights from Day Two of Blockchain Summit at International Blockchain Week, Shanghai", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 23}

The data and tokens can also be transferred from one zone to another in an IBC packet (called a \u201ccoin packet\u201d) throughout the hub, sender, and receiver blockchains.\nKwon stated that by creating a federation of blockchains using Tendermint proof-of-stake to secure the hub and zones, sending and receiving tokens from one zone to another is quick, without the need to wait an hour for proof-of-work mining to add additional confirmations.\n\u201cAdditionally, it means anyone can create their own proof-of-stake chain or Tendermint-powered consortium chain and be a part of this federation,\u201d he said.\nHowever, in order for it to be successful, there are still matters that need to be overcome.\n\u201cThe hub will be permissionless, so there will be challenges in constructing the policy and protocol framework for dealing with zone failures,\u201d Kwon said.\nThe Cosmos Zone\nAs an independent blockchain, a Cosmos zone exchanges IBC messages through the hub. The hub sees a zone as a multi-asset, dynamic-membership, multi-signature account that is able to send and receive tokens utilizing IBC packets.\nHowever, just like a digital currency account, a zone does not have the ability to transfer tokens beyond the amount it holds at any one time, but it can receive tokens from others if they have them.\nThrough the use of Cosmos, different blockchains will run simultaneously with one another. Kwon explained that one of the benefits of this is that it makes it easy for blockchains to interoperate with each other, unlike existing proposals that aim to develop a single blockchain with total global transaction ordering.\n\u201cWe could have an Ethereum zone and a Zcash zone both connected to the hub, and you\u2019d be able to use your tokens in a Solidity smart contract, but also anonymize them by going through the Zcash zone,\u201d he said.\nAt present, this kind of interoperability between blockchains is still an open problem, but with Cosmos, blockchain developers can focus on their core competency, so the whole ecosystem can become more modular, added Kwon. Furthermore, if more zones are required, the Cosmos enables blockchains to scale. Clients can simply add extra zones to handle more users and additional transactions.\n\u201cToday\u2019s proposals for decentralized exchanges are largely built on a technique called atomic cross-chain transactions, which is trustless and great, but requires both parties to a trade to be online to make the trade,\u201d Kwon said.\nWith Cosmos, traders are able to set limit orders and go offline, while the validators of the blockchain are responsible for executing trades on the user\u2019s behalf. Reliance on central exchanges is reduced, creating more monetary liquidity.\nThe security of the Cosmos Hub is important, as it essentially acts as the central ledger. Because it needs to be secure enough to withstand the most severe attack scenarios, such as a nation-state sponsored attack, its security is ensured by a set of globally decentralized validators.\nEven though Tendermint is the winner of the \"Most Innovative\" award, Kwon knows they still have a tough job ahead of them.\n\u201cWe have an ambitious mission to solve a lot of the longstanding problems in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, and we hope to achieve that in the years to come,\u201d he added.", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 23}

The beta version is set to debut October 3.\nRo said the firm started \u201cquietly researching\u201d bitcoin in 2012, and formalized its digitization group this year.\nShe noted that $5.3 trillion in currencies are traded per day, compared with $50 million to $200 million in bitcoin.\n\u201cIf you asked a room of foreign traders how many people trade bitcoin, a small minority would raise hands,\u201d she said, citing liquidity and regulator fears.\nCME hopes to be a bridge for foreign exchange traders, she said, an aim that would be echoed by several presenters.\n\u201cIf you think about trading bitcoin right now, it's not really easy,\u201d she said. \u201cNot yet.\u201d\nThe State of Russian Adoption\nFrom the banking sector, Alex Batlin of UBS discussed blockchains in the industry, and Pavel Khodalev of Sberbank discussed the outlook in Russia among banks and the government.\nKhodalev noted how the central bank of Russia has interbank operations written to a blockchain, but said wider adoption is still hampered by a \u201cchicken or the egg\u201d problem regarding standards and regulations, as well as the question of whether to wait for clear standards to develop or to encourage the Russian government to take action.\nBlockchains for Fintech \nOther speakers presented their fintech infrastructure companies as a bridge to distributed ledgers, like Dominic Williams of Dfinity, Mark Smith of Symbiont, David Johnston of Factom and Rich Teo of Itbit and Paxos, each presenting solutions for recording and facilitating asset transactions.\nA Post-Capitalist World\nTempering this was Han from Otonomos, which focuses on expediting clients\u2019 business requirements with the aim of freeing resources to simply run core operations. Han, who only goes by one name, dwelt on the promise held by \u201cubiquitous computing\u201d and predicted that it would lead to a post-capitalist world. He derided traditional systems by noting the physical paper that represents corporate shares have been in use since the 1600s, and that companies still use wax stamps.\nPushing for Protocols\nThough not always explicit or technical, implementations naturally underpinned most presentations of blockchain service companies, and the topic was directly addressed in talks by Zcash and Bloq.\nFrom the former, Zooko Wilcox described how their Zero-Knowledge Security Layer, or ZSL (a nod to Secure Sockets Layer, the internet\u2019s first widespread encryption scheme) would offer \u201cselective disclosure.\u201d The system would use keys to limit read access to specific parts of a transaction, enabling direct parties as well as regulators and clearing houses to view details, while trade-reporting repositories and market data aggregators might see only what was traded and at what price.\nThe Linux Analogy\nBloq\u2019s Jeff Garzik took the stage next and immediately gave a nod to Wilcox for implementing privacy and security in a unique way. He gave an example of having Apple and Microsoft\u2019s transactions on the same blockchain, and asked whether they would want each other to have access their transaction data.\nGarzik drew on lessons from working at Red Hat in the early days of Linux Enterprise, and discussed the \u201cmissing pieces from DIY, download-it-yourself\u201d programs for enterprise deployments serving corporations that need service and maintenance.\nFor that, he was betting on open-source community development.\n\u201cImagine if Goldman or JPMorgan had private blockchains. Are students going to stay up coding for it?\u201d Garzik asked the audience. \u201cNo, they're going to code where the other developers are.\u201d\nChallenges for Enterprise\nGarzik noted the problems that arise with the demands of enterprise clients.\n\u201cThey're not simply going to go to a website and run multi-million-dollar payment networks on that. Similarly, you don't want to run your business off volunteers. In the real world, we have deadlines,\u201d he said.\nHe said Bloq aims to be the bridge for traditional companies using blockchains by being in the middle, offering support, maintenance and legal guarantees. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine during the event, he said they use \u201cthe battle-tested blockchains,\u201d Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\u201cThere are other blockchain peddlers who are making stacks that are incompatible,\u201d Garzik said.\nHe drew a comparison to the very early days of Linux, when \u201ca very large Japanese multinational hardware producer\u201d wanted to contribute to and support its hardware.\n\u201cYou know the normal development process: submit patches, review, merge. There was culture clash. Sometimes it\u2019s difficult to deal with the developer community. On the first patch they submitted, it was met with skepticism, four-letter word insults. It was so ugly, and that resulted in a year loss in contributions from that company.\u201d\nHe cautioned against such frictions between blockchain firms and established corporations today.\n\u201cSimilarly, we have lots of very liberal, anarchist, crypto people in our community, who have zero interest in working for big banks.\u201d\nOn the other hand, he said, \u201cYou want to avoid an IBM running the table.\u201d\nThe TCP/IP of blockchain\nIn moving toward future protocols, Garzik pointed to the BIP and EIP systems for deciding on standards, and said that he thought Hyperledger would be a good forum for that.\n\u201cEthereum or Bitcoin,\u201d Garzik said, \u201cis going to be the TCP/IP of blockchain.\u201d\nWant to find out what happened on Day One? \u00a0Check out our highlights from the first day of Blockchain Summit at International Blockchain Week, Shanghai.", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 24}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nCoinciding with the opening of the\u00a0Ethereum Foundation\u2019s\u00a0Devcon2 conference in Shanghai this week, significant parts of the Ethereum network were\u00a0crashing. In what\u00a0seemed like an attack using an intentionally difficult-to-execute smart contract, the much used Ethereum implementation Geth\u00a0stopped functioning altogether, while another implementation \u2014 Parity \u2014 was also having\u00a0issues. Upon discovering the attack, Ethereum developers wrote a\u00a0hotfix for Geth within a couple of hours that seemed to solve the problem, at least temporarily.*Interestingly, while the fix was happening,\u00a0alternative Ethereum implementations (other than Geth and Parity) were doing fine. Save for a drop in hash rate due to miners running Geth, the Ethereum network kept running smoothly for most users of these different clients. This lack of interruption was taken\u00a0by\u00a0some as a vindication of Ethereum\u2019s use of multiple interoperable software implementations, rather than a single client.\nThis success on Ethereum\u2019s part, in turn,\u00a0reignited\u00a0a debate that has existed in the Bitcoin space for years: do alternative Bitcoin implementations strengthen the Bitcoin network \u2014 or weaken it?\nThe \u201cReference Implementation\u201d\nThe question whether alternative software implementations for Bitcoin are desirable has been discussed for years. These implementations, or clients, are essentially computer programs that connect to, and therefore become part of, the network. The debates surrounding their role date from the early days of Bitcoin\u2019s history, back when the community mostly consisted of tinkering techies.\nThe first Bitcoin implementation was of course Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s version of Bitcoin, written in the coding language C++. This client later become known as Bitcoin-Qt, and now Bitcoin Core; it is sometimes also referred to as Bitcoin\u2019s \u201creference client\u201d or the \u201cSatoshi client.\u201d For a while, this was the only Bitcoin implementation \u2014 although over time Satoshi released updates; i.e., slightly different versions of the same client.\nSatoshi Nakamoto himself believed it was best to stick to only one Bitcoin implementation. He thought alternative implementations might process data differently, thus posing a significant risk that they would run out of sync with each other. Satoshi warned this would undermine a key property of Bitcoin: the ability of all users to reach consensus over the state of the blockchain ledger.\nIn 2010, debating Gavin Andresen on\u00a0Bitcointalk, Satoshi argued,\n\u201cI don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea. So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep that a second implementation would be a menace to the network.\u201d\nGavin Andresen, who would later succeed Satoshi Nakamoto as lead developer of Bitcoin\u2019s reference client,\u00a0replied that the desirability of alternative implementations was irrelevant. Andresen believed that these would be inevitable \u2014 whether Satoshi liked it or not.\nHe stated:\n\u201cGood idea or not, SOMEBODY will try to mess up the network (or co-opt it for their own use) sooner or later. They'll either hack the existing code or write their own version, and will be a menace to the network.\u201d\nThe First Alternatives\nWhether or not Satoshi Nakamoto liked alternative Bitcoin implementations indeed proved to be irrelevant. The first alt-clients sprang up shortly after Bitcoin\u2019s inventor disappeared from the community.\nThis trend started with\u00a0libbitcoin, first announced in 2011. A project led by Amir Taaki, libbitcoin was designed to provide an alternative to the Satoshi client in order to decentralize control over Bitcoin and increase the network\u2019s robustness when faced with attacks.\nTaaki explained his motivation in\u00a0The Libbitcoin Manifesto, writing:\n\u201cA diversified Bitcoin of many wallets and implementations is a strong and pure Bitcoin. To protect the integrity of the network, we need to eliminate single points of failure. An inbred Bitcoin with the same software code everywhere shares the same weaknesses, and is susceptible to the same attacks. A single pathogen can wipe out a genetically homogenous population. And centralized software is vulnerable to the dictates of whoever controls development of that software code, and any dictates pressured onto them.\u201d\nNot much later, more alternative implementations saw the light of day. Mike Hearn\u2019s\u00a0bitcoinj was the first Bitcoin client written in a different coding language (Java), while Jeff Garzik followed with\u00a0picocoin and Tam\u00e1s Blummer launched\u00a0Bits of Proof.\nIn 2013\u00a0Btcd, a Bitcoin implementation written in Google\u2019s coding language \u201cGo\u201d was introduced. Btcd\u2019s launch was covered by Bitcoin Magazine in\u00a0an article written by then-Bitcoin Magazine writer Vitalik Buterin.\nEchoing Taaki\u2019s plea for a more diverse ecosystem, Buterin wrote:\n\u201c[T]he deeper into the protocol one goes, the more it becomes a monoculture; but monocultures are dangerous. If there is only one implementation being widely used, then unforeseen bugs appearing (or even disappearing) in upgrades can cause the entire Bitcoin blockchain to essentially fork into two as the two versions of the protocol disagree on which transactions and blocks are valid and which are not.\u201d\nBy this time, Andresen had taken the reins of Bitcoin Core as its lead developer. Even more so than when debating Satoshi Nakamoto three years prior, Andresen had come to believe that multiple implementations would strengthen the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nIn a\u00a0blog post for the Bitcoin Foundation, he wrote:\n\u201cDiversity is a good thing. Diverse, interoperating implementations of the Bitcoin protocol make the network more robust against software bugs, denial-of-service attacks and vulnerabilities.\u201d\nSince, an increasing number of Bitcoin implementations have connected to the\u00a0Bitcoin network, most written in their own programming language.\nCriticism\nThe increasing number of Bitcoin implementations may seem like a success of the multiple-client approach. However, much of the Bitcoin network is still dominated by the \u201creference client\u201d \u2014 Bitcoin Core and versions thereof. To date, complete re-implementations seem to have gained relatively little traction among users, companies, and especially miners.\nIn 2015, addressing the libbitcoin development team on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd explained why he believes this to be the case. Simply put, users, companies and miners require software that follows the Bitcoin protocol. And the Bitcoin protocol, Todd argued, is defined by (some of) the code as implemented in the Satoshi client. Any other code may \u2014 unintentionally \u2014 \u00a0follow a different protocol, even if that\u2019s not noticeable yet.\n\u201cThe consensus critical Satoshi-derived sourcecode is a protocol *specification* that happens to also be machine readable and executable,\u201d Todd wrote. \u201cBy reimplementing consensus code \u2014 rewriting the protocol spec \u2014 you drop out of the political process that is Bitcoin development. You're not decentralizing Bitcoin at all \u2014 you're contributing to its centralization by not participating, leaving behind a smaller and more centralized development process. Fact is, what you've implemented in libbitcoin just isn't the Bitcoin protocol and isn't going to get adopted by miners nor used by serious merchants and exchanges \u2014 the sources of real political power.\u201d\nWriting to a different development mailing list, Todd took this logic to mean that even bugs in the Satoshi-derived source code should be considered part of the protocol \u2014 meaning any \u201cbug free\u201d alternative software implementation is, in that case, not running the same protocol. For alternative implementations to really run the Bitcoin protocol, they must be \u201cbug-for-bug compatible.\u201d\nInstead of fully reimplementing a code base, Todd therefore argued developers should simply fork Bitcoin Core, and tweak that code base to fit their needs. Todd himself did exactly that for his\u00a0Replace-by-fee fork, while Bitcoin Core developers BtcDrak and Luke Dashjr similarly maintain the Bitcoin Core forks\u00a0Bitcoin Addrindex and Bitcoin Knots. (And over the past year, a comparable trend emerged as developers wanting to increase Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit launched\u00a0Bitcoin XT,\u00a0Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited \u2014 though these forks were actually designed to split off to a new protocol under certain conditions.)\nCounter-criticism\nOf course, Todd\u2019s argument was itself criticized.\nFor example, while acknowledging that alternative implementations do risk forking off to their own network, Btcd developer Dave Collins pointed out that the Bitcoin network already consists of many different software versions, including the many different versions of the Satoshi client. Importantly, these different versions of the same client can fork off to different networks just as well, and indeed\u00a0have\u00a0done\u00a0so in the past.\nAs such, Collins argued, there is no fundamental distinction between different versions of the same client and alternative clients. From his\u00a0conformal blog:\n\u201cThere is currently no way to guarantee that any two versions of Bitcoin software, whether they are two different versions of Bitcoin Core, two different versions of alternative implementations, a version of Bitcoin Core versus a version of an alternative implementation, or even two copies of the same version of Bitcoin Core built with different compiler versions, are in exact consensus agreement. Doing so is incredibly difficult and borders on impossible. The issue is implementation independent.\u201d\nLibbitcoin is today led by Eric Voskuil. Unsurprisingly, Voskuil agrees with Collins. And while Voskuil also acknowledges Todd\u2019s position that bugs are part of the consensus encoding of an implementation, he argues this means there should not be one particular implementation to define the Bitcoin protocol.\n\u201cAll code that impacts consensus is part of consensus,\u201d Voskuil told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cBut when part of this code stops the network or does something not nice, it's called a bug needing a fix, but that fix is a change to consensus. Since bugs are consensus, fixes are forks. As such, a single implementation gives far too much power to its developers. Shutting down the network while some star chamber works out a new consensus is downright authoritarian.\u201d\nEthereum\nThis week\u2019s failure of Ethereum\u2019s Geth nodes perhaps presents the first clear real-world example of one set of software implementations crashing, while alternatives \u2014 and therefore the network itself \u2014 was able to keep running.\nOf course, this diversity within Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem for a large part resulted from Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s vision \u2014 the same Buterin who, as writer for Bitcoin Magazine, argued in favor of a more diverse Bitcoin ecosystem. From the start, Ethereum launched with several different clients, rather than one specific reference implementation.\nNot everyone agrees it was desirable for the Ethereum network to keep running while Geth nodes were crashing, however. Peter Todd, indeed, maintains it would have been better for all nodes on the network to have behaved identically \u2014 even if that means they\u2019d have all crashed.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Todd explained:\n\u201cBasically the trade-offs are very simple. Having multiple implementations prioritizes availability of the network, but using the network while the issue was being fixed was a pretty dangerous thing to do. The Parity nodes weren't propagating blocks at normal speeds, increasing orphan rates and making it more likely to have a false confirmation. The lower hashing power than normal made 51 percent attacks more of a risk. The Geth fix could have been botched. And in general, during the event whether or not any of that happened was unknown. Safest is for everything to shut down if something goes wrong, which in this case would have only been a few hours of downtime \u2014 not a big deal.\u201d\nAnd Todd believes the situation could have been worse if Geth nodes hadn\u2019t shut down, but would have instead confirmed or rejected different transactions and blocks.\n\u201cGeth could have easily split off to another chain, in which case the problem would have been much worse. In that case, it's not clear which one is actually the right chain,\u201d he said.\nOf course, this is where libbitcoin\u2019s Eric Voskuil, disagrees. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Voskuil said he believes that Todd is approaching the problem from the wrong perspective. Rather than a software implementation defining the protocol, Voskuil instead says that those who actually conduct in trade should do this work.\n\u201cThere is no \u201cright chain\u201d \u2014 just those that people choose to use,\u201d Voskuil said. \u201cIf the One True Implementation defines consensus, and it fails, what is the consensus? The fact that people on the Ethereum network kept using other implementations meant that developers writing the \u201cfix\u201d to Geth couldn\u2019t redefine consensus, but needed to conform to the actual consensus.\u201d\nFuture Strategies\nMoving forward, there are several projects in the works that may have the potential to help the Bitcoin ecosystem become even more diversified \u2014 perhaps even without risking blockchain-splits. At least, that\u2019s what some believe.\nPeter Todd\u00a0pointed out that formal proofs could be of help in the future. Explaining the concept to Bitcoin Magazine, he said:\n\u201cBasically, formal proofs have math to prove that code does what you think it does. Or at least, that code has a certain property. This can be used to verify that different implementations will really follow the same protocol. This is not a huge stretch; formal proofs are already used in Bitcoin to prove that parts of the libsecp256k1 library are correct.\u201d\nAnother promising project may be libconsensus, a software library derived from the Bitcoin Core code base. An effort by Bitcoin Core developers that started in 2014, libconsensus should enable alternative implementations to easily adopt the code required to remain in consensus with the rest of the network.\nBitcoin Core and Blockstream developer Jorge Tim\u00f3n has been one of the main advocates of and most active contributors to libconsensus. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Tim\u00f3n explained that since \u201cBitcoin Core\u201d is the implementation currently in practice, the notion that \u201cthe implemation is the specification\u201d is actually problematic.\n\u201cThat is unfair to other implementations, in certain sense,\u201d said Timon. \u201cThey are warned against reimplementing consensus validation, but no solution is given to them besides\u2019\u201crun your things behind a Bitcoin Core node.\u2019 So we\u2019re separating enough code from Bitcoin Core to fully verify a block \u2014 and nothing else. This can be used by alternative implementations, to work from there.\u201d\nLibbitcoin\u2019s Voskuil, however, remains skeptical that libconsensus is really needed to diversify Bitcoin\u2019s ecosystem.\n\u201cLibconsensus is an honest attempt to help create a more diverse community, and libbitcoin supports it as an option,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cBut it will not survive as a long-term solution. It's unnecessary, complicates development, and does not currently cover anything but script validation. If it were to expand to cover everything that might result in a fork, it would be most of the implementation of a node. We could dump our own script code in favor of libconsensus, but as libconsensus expands to include all impacts on consensus, what would we be left with? It's a camel's nose under the tent.\u201d\nVoskuil added:\n\u201cIn the end, all this is really a moot point. Other implementations exist and are running on the network. This will not stop, it will only increase. The idea that consensus rules cannot be implemented as reliably in multiple implementations, across multiple versions of one implementation, is not only absurd, it's irrelevant.\u201d\n*This story was written before new attacks troubled the Ethereum network on Thursday.

New regulatory requirements are leading to greater demands to collect relevant client information before establishing a business relationship.\nKYC (Know Your Customer), AML (Anti-Money Laundering), CTF (Counter-Terrorism Financing) and other labor intensive activities can have a chilling effect on business productivity and exact a huge cost. This is the result of voluminous amounts of customer data needing to be manually checked for accuracy, completeness, and duplications to ensure that targeted requirements are met.\nCustomer losses leading to a decline in revenue can result if these data gathering, onboarding, and client-lifecycle activities are inefficiently handled. An example of this is in the financial services industry where a customer may drop a banking relationship due to a lengthy credit decision process and more rapid competitor response. Moreover, slow manual processes have become prime targets for increased regulatory scrutiny and inspections, resulting in fines and even jail time for business leaders.\nThe need for advanced automation and real-time customer setup solutions has never been greater. One of the solutions being advanced are cost-effective, automated blockchain solutions for meeting regulatory demands tied with KYC, AML, and CTF. An emerging startup player in this space is the Ireland-based firm, Kyckr.\nTaming the Compliance Jungle\nKyckr is a blockchain-centric solutions provider that delivers end-to-end compliance data sourced from over 150 business registers worldwide. Information captured and disseminated through the use of Kyckr\u2019s verification API \u00a0is used by banks, financial institutions, payment solutions providers, accounting and law firms and other organizations to meet regulatory requirements, all with the goal of preventing criminal activities such as money laundering, terrorism, and fraud.\nKyckr\u2019s beginning and evolution has been an interesting one. Rob Leslie, company founder and brainchild, spent his early career living in Japan working as an electronics engineer. After nearly 20 years, he returned to Ireland and was introduced to Ben Cronin, his eventual Kyckr co-founder.\nDuring a coffee shop meeting in early 2007, Cronin mentioned an opportunity for the commercialization of compliance data via European Business Registers. Leslie thought it looked like an interesting idea, so they started a new initiative in March 2007, just as regulation was starting to drive changes. Their first sale was in December 2008, with data being delivered from 12 European registers. They now deliver data from over 155 registers around the world via their web portal and API.\nRecently Kyckr announced a new, collaborative effort for its corporate identity blockchain service with Credits, a platform that provides distributed ledger technology software and cloud-based services. This move signals Kyckr\u2019s commercial readiness to deliver an automated alternative to the prevailing model for capturing and employing compliance information. \u00a0The goal of this partnership is to become the best-in-class service for verified, secure and trusted corporate identity \u2014 a single source of truth.\nSpeaking with Bitcoin Magazine, Leslie described the current AML and KYC environments as complex and hard. \u201cAs Kyckr grows, we are seeing how we can apply automation to solving lots of tasks that are currently manual. This allows banks and other organizations to put their staff to work on the complex cases, instead of the vast majority of organizations, which are straightforward in their process.\u201d \u00a0\nHe says that Kyckr has always held the view that to do KYC properly, information must be gathered from the authoritative source, which is the business register. \u201cNothing else should ever be accepted, as the provenance and veracity of the data cannot be guaranteed.\u201d\nOver the course of its evolution, Kyckr has also discovered that identity information, whether it be personal or corporate, does not naturally exist in aggregated databases. Rather it is stored in disparate places, requiring API connections to build complete identity profiles from primary sources.\nKyckr\u2019s just-in-time element is likely to be viewed as its prized value proposition. Says Leslie: \u201cWe believe that real-time monitoring is needed to allow compliance to be maintained in real-time. Also, we think governments need to do more, as they have a duty to provide the means for identity to be verified, efficiently and quickly. To date, they have not done this well. Kyckr is aiming at making organizational access to the data easier in order to make the compliance process more efficient, faster and better for everyone.\u201d\nLeslie believes that Kyckr\u2019s corporate identity blockchain will get a lot of attention as there is an increasing awareness of identity information serving as the root of everything. \u00a0\u201cThis verification process must be digital, secure, trusted and fast. \u00a0We will be looking at how we can support the rapid growth that is happening in this space when it comes to delivering digital trust by ensuring the availability of a solid trust anchor.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 26}
{"title": "Op-Ed: Ethereum vs Ethereum: Which Is the Ship of Theseus?", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/ethereum-vs-ethereum-which-is-the-ship-of-theseus-1474991313/", "birthday": "Sep 27, 2016  11:48 AM EST", "date": "2016-09-27 16:48:00", "content": "Imagine this scenario: Tom owes you money. Years later, Tom clones himself and claims the clone to be the real Tom, trying to write off all his debt to you. Tom the clone looks just like the original Tom, except for the memory. He doesn\u2019t know you at all, let alone the debt. This would be unacceptable to you: You\u2019d be furious and would probably want to take him to court.\nNow we are seeing this sort of scenario in our crypto community with the Ethereum hard fork, which was met by many, not with anger but with compliments and commendations for being exemplary and kindhearted. By modifying Ethereum codes, the hard fork forcibly transferred all The DAO and child DAO funds to a certain refund contract address, on block height 1920000 for \u201cretrieving\u201d hacker-controlled DAO tokens.\nCan we call it a success? The verdict depends on your position in a philosophical argument based on \u201cThe Ship of Theseus.\u201d Plutarch describes a ship of this name that sails for hundreds of years while maintaining, repairing and replacing parts along the way. So when the time comes that every single piece of the ship is replaced at least once, can we call this ship the original Ship of Theseus? Further, if a new ship was built using all parts that were taken from the old Ship of Theseus, we would have two ships. Which one of these two is the real Ship of Theseus?\nIn real life, we don\u2019t have this confusion. Our bodies are made of basic particles, and every single second from our birth the body keeps metabolizing: human skin will be updated every three weeks, liver cells take five months, while the most stable part, the bone tissues, updates every 10 years. All the cells in your body today are quite different from those of yesterday, almost totally different from those of a few years ago. But, people would say, you are yourself, the same person as that of a few years ago. Why?\nApparently, the essence of the matter is not about the tissue and structure, but its functionality and spatiotemporal continuity. The philosopher Laozi may have solved the puzzle of the Ship of Theseus in his Tao Te Ching 2,000 years ago: \u57cf\u57f4\u4ee5\u4e3a\u5668\uff0c\u5f53\u5176\u65e0\uff0c\u6709\u5668\u4e4b\u7528\u3002\u51ff\u6237\u7256\u4ee5\u4e3a\u5ba4\uff0c\u5f53\u5176\u65e0\uff0c\u6709\u5ba4\u4e4b\u7528\u3002\u6545\u6709\u4e4b\u4ee5\u4e3a\u5229\uff0c\u65e0\u4e4b\u4ee5\u4e3a\u7528, which means that bowls made of argil are bowls because of the hollow in the middle (so it could function as a bowl); and a house with open windows is a house because of the hollow inside (so it could function as a house). This is to say, the tangible part, the materials, bring the potential for convenience, but not the function per se. The hollowness is the essence of the matter: its functionality. A bowl is a bowl for its function, not the material used (could be wood, paste, argil or metal). The Ship of Theseus, though with all its parts changed, is still carrying the same group of passengers. The passengers entered into a contract with the ship upon purchasing the ticket and boarding it. This contract will not be transferred to another ship as long as the ship is still functioning as the vehicle that transfers passengers from the departure port to the destination.\nA blockchain is just like a Ship of Theseus, with Bitcoin\u2019s Satoshi client updating and changing all along the way. To begin, the client was something similar to a bunch of rusty iron and copper and some wood. We could call it the Ship of Theseus v.0.0.0.0. After some time, it starts to look like a ship. We\u2019ll call it the Ship of Theseus v.0.0.0.1. Eventually, it will iterate into the Ship of Theseus v.27.78.1.0.\nThe Bitcoin codes today are quite different from those of \u00a0the original Satoshi client. But we never have had a recognition confusion. Why is that? Simple: We are still following the historical transaction data of Bitcoin. Since the genesis block, these transaction data are the passengers of the ship of the blockchain. The data was entered into a contract with the Bitcoin client, and it was never mutated.\nHowever, the iteration of Bitcoin is completely different from that of the Ethereum hard fork. ETH built a new ship using the old parts taken from the Ship of Theseus, with DIFFERENT passengers, and yet it claims the new ship to be the real one. The original ship did not disappear as the devs wished; it is still sailing on its original course. Now we have two almost identical ships, except for the different passengers and maybe different future routes.\nSo which one is the real Ship of Theseus? It is utterly obvious. If we could liken soft forks to the metabolism of human body, a hard fork can be seen as its genetic cloning. Tom who lent you money seven years ago may have had his body cells changed, but he is still the same guy: the financial, social and remembered connections between you two still exist. But in the other scenario, Tom cloned himself and tried to transfer the debt to the clone, even though the clone has no memory of you or the debt: Why should you, the court and society recognize and accept that clone?\nSo, can we call ETH_HF a success? Yes, it is a success \u2014 a success at creating confusion. The saying goes you cannot fool everyone all of the time; there are already indications that this calling-white-black tactic is faltering. Since the hard fork, many have been asking, \u201cIf data on a blockchain cannot be mutated or reversed, and then what\u2019s this? Why can Ethereum do this?\u201d\nTo be clear, the computation power of the Ethereum blockchain is not as dramatic as that of Bitcoin, but the data of the Ethereum chain IS immutable. It\u2019s just that they call the chain with the right data Ethereum Classic now.\nSome may argue that the essence of proof-of-work is that computation is power. The longest chain comprises of the most workload, granting it legitimacy. ETH has far greater computation power than ETC, and the block height of the ETH is also far greater than the ETC. ETH is the legal chain.\nThis is another kind of sophistry. The proof-of-work gives the longest chain legitimacy; that is correct. But the prerequisite is that all the miners are mining in the same version. For example, if someone released a Bitcoin HF version in which the blocks generate every minute, then this new version will see a blockchain that significantly outpaces the original one. Wouold this scenario be considered legitimate?\nThe only legitimate way of modifying blockchain data is with a 51 percent attack. Can the Ethereum core devs do that? Certainly they cannot. However, they are good clone scientists. You can expect a second cloning since there\u2019s been a first one. We now see two groups in the Ethereum community. This is like Conway\u2019s Game of Life with cellular automation: gliders, for every four rounds, move to the right bottom by one. The cells become different, but the state remains the same. Glider guns keep releasing gliders one after another. This is a perfect simulation.\n\n\nA final question: Can the official Ethereum team modify the blockchain? That will depend on the answer to these questions:\nA\uff1aWhat defines a blockchain?\nB\uff1aWhat is official?\nC\uff1aWhat does modify mean?\nD\uff1aWhich Ethereum?\nThis op-ed is a guest post by Chang Jia.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nFirst\u00a0announced on the\u00a0cryptography mailing list in 2008, Bitcoin was the\u00a0embodiment of a decade-old cypherpunk vision. A digital currency not controlled by any government, bank, or company existed in the hearts and minds of hackers and cryptographers long before most even considered the concept viable.\nSince its launch in 2009, Bitcoin ignited a new industry, with interest reaching far beyond the small group of ideologues. Its blockchain technology today even serves as an inspiration for the very governments, banks, and companies the pioneering cryptocurrency was designed to subvert.\nThe third annual edition of the\u00a0Hackers Congress Paraleln\u00ed Polis (HCPP16), set to start this Friday, September 30, in Prague, will remember Bitcoin\u2019s roots. The three-day gathering in the markedly black\u00a0Paraleln\u00ed Polis building will bring together cypherpunks and crypto-anarchists from around the Czech Republic, Europe and the rest of the world.\nTo learn more about the event, Bitcoin Magazine spoke with Martin Sip, project coordinator for Paraleln\u00ed Polis and HCPP16 organizer, and Pavol Lupt\u00e1k, Paraleln\u00ed Polis co-founder.\nHCPP16 is very much a product of its hosting location, Paraleln\u00ed Polis. What kind of place is this?\nSip: Paralelni Polis is a state-free NGO started by local guerrilla artist group\u00a0Ztohoven and the Slovak hacker-space\u00a0ProgressBar. It\u2019s a space for the promotion of ideas and technologies that give people more freedom online \u2014 mainly the tools of cryptography and cryptocurrencies.\nLupt\u00e1k: Paraleln\u00ed Polis is named after the original ideas of Czech Cold War era political thinker and dissident, V\u00e1clav Benda, about parallel, underground societies. We are mostly voluntaryists or anarchists who believe that Benda\u2019s vision can be achieved on the internet with crypto-anarchist technologies.\nWhat exactly is crypto-anarchy?\nSip: Simply put, crypto-anarchy is the idea that people can govern and organize themselves without governments, by using the tools of cryptography, cryptocurrencies and other means of decentralization.\nLupt\u00e1k: With these tools, we can build a more effective, a more free and a more voluntary society. We can, for example, have access to fully decentralized anonymous cryptomarkets with stronger reputation and escrow services, where everything is 30 to 50 percent cheaper than in the markets regulated and taxed by governments.\nAnd we don't even need the acceptance of a majority of people or politicians. Human nature \u2014 the fact that people primarily prefer to suit their individual needs \u2014 can ensure that no one will be willing to pay government tax in the virtual internet world. Crypto-anarchists can demonstrate how the current political systems based on coercion \u2014 taxes \u2014 could collapse.\nAnd you believe that would be a good thing?\nLupt\u00e1k: Our current society is just too complex and global to be hierarchical with authoritative governments. Too complex to follow and enforce monolithic laws and regulations for so many heterogeneous people.\nIf we want to keep our complex society free, we believe this can be achieved only in a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer and mutually voluntary way. All other solutions will probably end up in some kind of totalitarian world.\nCrypto-anarchists also spoke of assassination markets and other quite dark concepts\u2026\nLupt\u00e1k: Yes, Jim Bell\u2019s\u00a0Assassination Politics is probably the best known of these. Though, despite the fact this is technically feasible, there is no evidence this concept has been ever been applied.\nI think and believe that the benefits of crypto-anarchy will overcome their negative impact. Like the internet, which also offers a huge playground for pedophiles, Satanists, Nazis and terrorists... No one wants to ban the internet just because of this.\nAnd if you don't do evil, don't intervene to the other people\u2019s lives, other people shouldn't be motivated to contribute to your death. Some dark crypto-anarchists even argue that, if there was crypto-anarchy 100 hundred years ago, we would never have people like Hitler, Stalin and other crazy dictators rise to power... We wouldn\u2019t have had world wars... and maybe in some way they are right.\nBut what\u2019s most important to realize \u2014 despite all negative consequences of crypto-anarchy \u2014 it cannot be stopped now. It's here and people have to cope with that.\nHow will the Hackers Congress Paraleln\u00ed Polis bring forth crypto-anarchist ideas?\nLupt\u00e1k: One of the speakers is Timothy C. May, the technical and political writer who probably coined the term \u201ccrypto-anarchy\u201d in The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto, as well as the phrase The Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse. As May\u2019s crazy predictions and visions are now coming true, he will be reflecting on 30 years of crypto-anarchy.\nSip: Another very notable speaker is Paul Rosenberg, author of the crypto-anarchist bible: A Lodging of Wayfaring Men, and more recently the book, The Breaking Dawn. He is also founder of Cryptohippie which provides online privacy services, and he is author of the\u00a0Freeman's Perspective blog that invites readers \u201cto see the world as it really is.\u201d During the Hackers Congress, Paul will give a talk on \u201cHow To Evolve and Hack Your Soul.\u201d\nLupt\u00e1k: And then there\u2019s Smuggler, the author of the\u00a0Second Realm Manifesto. And of course people like Sam Patterson, the father of\u00a0OpenBazaar... Really, I personally consider all our speakers to be extraordinary in some way, with a strong respect for their work, and past or current activities.\nWhere does Bitcoin fit in all this?\nSip: Bitcoin enables the unregulated exchange of value on a global scale, which is something we didn't have before and will have profound impact on a society. People will start doing things that they couldn't do before, and organize themselves in novel communities and structures. I think there will a big restructuring of society. Governments, banks, and even other corporations as we know them will dissolve or change in a profound way.\nLupt\u00e1k: Bitcoin is not just about changing business and creating new commercial opportunities. We really do perceive Bitcoin as liberational tool that can change the whole society. And I think its inventor, Satoshi, perceived Bitcoin in a similar way.\nWhile the Bitcoin-community was once perhaps dominated by this kind of revolutionary sentiment, you may be of a dying breed...\nLupt\u00e1k: I don\u2019t think so at all. At least our HCPP conference is more and more popular every year, with still new crypto-anarchists joining and related projects starting.Sip: I would agree that the crypto-anarchist sentiment is not as prevalent in the Bitcoin community these days as it used to be. But these strong ideas matter very much, even if they are lived by a only small part of the community. Because that is where the strongest innovators come from.\nIs that what you\u2019re seeing in Prague as well?\nSip: Bitcoin is doing great in the Czech Republic, and I am proud that most Czech Bitcoin companies are part of the community around Paraleln\u00ed Polis. We have several Bitcoin companies with global impact like\u00a0SatoshiLabs, the creator of the first hardware wallet \u2014 Trezor \u2014 and the first ever mining pool:\u00a0Slush\u2019s Pool. There\u2019s also\u00a0General Bytes, a major Bitcoin ATM producer that\u2019s also responsible for the Bitcoin payment system at the congress. And Prague itself is very active in bitcoin acceptance on the ground \u2014 according to\u00a0Coinmap.org there are over 80 physical shops accepting bitcoin. That\u2019s a lot for a city with just over 1 million citizens.\nReason enough to head over to Prague this weekend...\nLupt\u00e1k: There are a lot of Bitcoin conferences around the world, focused on blockchain, business, new technologies and that sort of stuff. But none of these reflect the radical political and technological ideas of how crypto and anonymization tools could significantly change our world. That's what we are trying to do. It's an underground Bitcoin conference, and probably the only one true crypto-anarchist conference on the planet.\nSip: And the reason the Congress is relatively long, is that it is also an informal yearly gathering of the world community around Paraleln\u00ed Polis. We want to give old members as well as new members the chance to interact, inspire, network or just spend more time with each other and be friends.\nLupt\u00e1k: If you sympathize or believe in crypto-anarchist ideas, there is no better conference to visit than HCPP 2016.", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 28}
{"title": "Understanding Soft Forks: A Core Developer\u2019s View on Network Monopoly", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/understanding-soft-forks-a-core-developer-s-view-on-network-monopoly-1474990034/", "birthday": "Sep 27, 2016  11:27 AM EST", "date": "2016-09-27 16:27:00", "content": "Since the beginning of the development of Segregated Witness, an increasing number of alternative Bitcoin hard fork supporters have criticized the implementation process of soft forks on Bitcoin Core, claiming that Core developers have a complete monopoly over the process.\nFormer Bitcoin Core developer Jeff Garzik and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin particularly stated that proposed soft forks have to undergo a majority consensus among Bitcoin Core developers that ultimately decide whether a soft fork becomes implemented into the BItcoin network.\n\u201cSoft forks very specifically, from an average user point of view, cannot be considered opt-in because the entire network is locked into the new consensus rule, regardless or not,\u201d said Garzik in a Bitcoin Status Report on the OnChain Scaling Conference on August 30.\nButerin further emphasized that soft forks involve various political issues as they limit and restrict the possibility of building and launching innovative projects and networks like ZCash.\nEssentially, Garzik and Buterin believe that soft fork implementations fail to reflect the view of the open source community of Bitcoin, since soft forks are verified, accepted, and implemented by the Bitcoin Core developers, instead of miners and node operators in the industry.\nHowever, Bitcoin Core developer and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo opposes the claims of Garzik and Buterin, stating that Core developers verify Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) ideas prior to their write-up only to confirm their technical aspects and applicability to Bitcoin Core software. In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Lombrozo elaborated on the reasons why he thinks that decentralization is strong, and how the role of miners and node operators is key.\nLombrozo explained that at the very first stage, a BIP idea is submitted to the mailing list, where the author, developers and Bitcoin technical community members briefly discuss the soft fork and assign it a BIP number. Once added to the repository, anyone can view, comment, and evaluate the proposal. The entire process takes place publicly giving the opportunity for different people to weigh in.\nIn the Bitcoin network, all node operators and miners have the authority to run whichever software or BIPs they wish to run. They can even refuse to run Bitcoin Core and choose to implement alternative Bitcoin software. When a soft fork is deployed on the network, every miner and node operator can choose to update their nodes to support the proposed BIP. If they disagree with the technical concept of the proposal, they can simply choose not to run the updated node. Thus, neither the Core Developers nor the author of the BIP are forcing anyone to implement the newly drafted proposal.\n\u201cThe BIP editor's responsibility is to make sure the BIP repository is properly maintained and that all the BIPs that get merged into it follow procedure and have the proper format. The BIP editor does not decide whether the soft fork will activate nor even if the code for it will get merged into Bitcoin Core,\u201d said Lombrozo.\nOnce a soft fork proposal is drafted and submitted to the repository, the code authoring and review process begin. Bitcoin Core developers and community members either choose to ACK (approve) or NACK (disapprove) the code of the BIP. Upon the confirmation of the BIP\u2019s code, the code merging and release process begin for further tests and evaluation.\n\u201cThe BIP author is responsible for also submitting code to implement the BIP. This code is then reviewed on Github in a public process open to the entire community. If Bitcoin Core maintainers feel the code has been sufficiently well-reviewed, tested and ACKed, and there are no outstanding NACKs with good reasoning, the code is merged and now there's the release process. It gets further tested, then once everyone feels the code is ready for release, it gets put into a release branch, which will eventually become the next version of Bitcoin Core,\u201d explained Lombrozo.\nAt this stage, the soft fork is still far from being activated. For the soft fork to be activated in Bitcoin Core, it requires at least 95 percent of hashpower from miners to active it.\nThis 95 percent threshold means that, in contrast to Garzik and Buterin\u2019s comments, neither Bitcoin Core developers nor the author of the BIP can coax the majority of the network to accept the proposal. If miners perceive the BIP to be genuine and applicable to Bitcoin Core software, the activation process begins. The Bitcoin Core software gives miners the explicit choice of whether to signal support.\nHowever, Lombrozo emphatically notes that the 95 percent activation process does not work for hard forks.\n\u201cHard forks, unlike soft forks, are not guaranteed to converge to a single chain. Even with a hashpower supermajority, multiple blockchains with different incompatible histories can result,\u201d said Lombrozo.\nIt is also important to note that anyone in the community can participate in the verification and approval process of the BIP, even during the technical code review.\nThus, Bitcoin Core developers don\u2019t benefit from a monopoly over the Bitcoin network in the soft fork implementation process. The verification process in the drafting stage of the BIP is merely designed for developers to confirm its technical aspects. Even if a soft fork passes the Core developer verification stage, without the support from the community, it will not be integrated into Bitcoin Core.\nIf over 5 percent of miners refuse to run the soft fork, then the network doesn\u2019t activate the proposal and nothing changes. If the soft fork is not activated before a deadline, it becomes permanently deactivated. If 95 percent of the network hashpower approves the soft fork within that deadline, the remaining miners and node operators have sufficient time to upgrade before the soft fork comes into effect.\nFrom the submission phase to the implementation stage, says Lombrozo, Bitcoin community members or anyone in the Bitcoin open source community can collaborate with Core developers in integrating a soft fork into the Bitcoin network. This process ensures that neither miners nor developers have the ability to unilaterally impose a soft fork.", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 27}

She and her partners at Third Key Solutions, Andreas M. Antonopoulos (CTO) and Richard Kagan (Business Advisor), provide advice and security solutions for wallets, exchanges, crowd sales, and new innovative Bitcoin and blockchain projects.\nBitcoin and Blockchain \"More Secure Than Ever Before\"\nIn an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Pamela Morgan noted the contradiction that, despite recent events, Bitcoin and blockchain technologies may actually be more secure now than ever before:\n\u201cBitcoin is more secure than it has ever been and it keeps getting stronger. The same is true for several other blockchains that increase their security as they mature and broaden their reach. But this is seemingly contradicted by frequent hacks affecting many users.\u201d\n\u201cThe contradiction lies in a subtle but important difference: Funds controlled directly by individuals in a decentralized manner and secured by decentralized blockchain protocols are extremely secure.\u201d\n\u201cOn the contrary, when a single entity concentrates control of funds from many individuals with custodial (aka hot) wallet accounts or poorly implemented large cold storage wallets, they become an extremely attractive target \u2014 a honeypot for attackers.\u201d\nSecurity Becomes an Important Priority for Ethereum\nOne such entity, the Ethereum DAO, suffered a cyber attack in June (losing one-third of its total funds) and the subsequent split into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.\nThis tested Ethereum\u2019s vulnerabilities and, among other measures, resulted in the hiring of Martin Holst Swende, a former NASDAQ information security specialist.\nSwende will work with Ethereum Foundation-funded projects to enhance their security and will be responsible for Ethereum\u2019s overall security during its ongoing development, working with smart contract developers and creating a special security website.\n\u201cUnintended Consequences Such as the Re-entrancy Bug\u201d\nWe asked Morgan about her take on the unprecedented Ethereum DAO attack. She told us:\n\u201cRapid and disruptive innovation is inherently risky. You don\u2019t get to the moon without blowing up a few rockets and we won\u2019t get to secure, large-scale smart contracts without blowing up a few DAOs. The same basic mantra of business applies here too \u2014 fail fast, fail cheap. The DAO achieved the former.\u201d\n\u201cWriting smart contracts that control funds securely is difficult. Over time, the security-critical components will mature through many iterations and many losses. Even though the Ethereum platform is past its beta, every new smart contract and component should be treated as pre-alpha software.\u201d\n\u201cSmart contracts need to mature and the Ethereum platform doesn\u2019t magically make them robust. Both the platform and the contracts will mature through iteration together. The funds controlled by smart contracts should be proportional to their degree of maturity and testing.\u201d\n\u201cToo much money was invested too quickly in an immature and overly complex contract. Complexity is the enemy of security. The flexibility introduced by a Turing complete, high-level smart contract language brings with it unintended consequences, such as the reentrancy bug that was introduced in the DAO contract.\u201d\nBitfinex: One for the Books\nThe August hack of Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange Bitfinex, one of the top bitcoin traders globally, to the tune of roughly $70 million, sent a chill through the digital currency world and shook any complacency around the security of bitcoin exchanges.\nSome experts have tied the hack to a shaky bitcoin price and wonder if it will take a while to restore confidence; others believe that Bitcoin\u2019s security has been affirmed since Bitfinex was able to avoid a shutdown and Bitcoin's blockchain retained its security and functionality in spite of the hack.\nIn his response to the Bitfinex attack, Stefan Thomas, one of the original Bitcoin developers and Ripple\u2019s Chief Technology Officer said, \u201cThere\u2019s no history of how to write secure code. It is not surprising that it would be easy to miss typical problems.\u201d\nMorgan commented:\n\u201cThe architecture of a bitcoin service provider, such as an exchange, holding funds for tens of thousands of users is inherently flawed. Re-centralizing data, in this case bitcoin keys, is the opposite of the decentralized architecture of Bitcoin itself.\u201d\n\u201cMultisignature technology has been widely misunderstood as a security \u201cfix\u201d but multisig is simply a tool. Two entities controlling the keys and funds of 100,000 users is a bit better than one entity, but not as good as 100,000 points of control.\u201d\n\u201cNo one knows how to secure large concentrations of data. The data breaches of companies like Yahoo, Target, Best Buy and even the NSA demonstrate this point. The very same issues of scale apply to bitcoin data. The difference between a bitcoin theft and identity theft is that bitcoin users feel the sting immediately.\u201d\nStaying One Step Ahead of the Hack with Formal Verification\n\u201cFormal verification\u201d is the new buzzword in the security business. Morgan thinks it is likely that eventually, \u201cmost smart contracts will incorporate formally verified components to build a strong foundation, and use more flexible coding practices for the rest of their contracts.\u201d\n\u201cFormal verification is an interesting methodology that rebalances the tradeoff between flexibility and security,\u201d she added. \u201cMany programmers will find it difficult to write code that can be formally verified; but for core services, such as deciding who owns a contract and who controls funds (authentication, authorization, policy) formal verification could deliver much more secure code.\u201d\n\u201cDecentralized Consensus is the Innovation that Matters.\u201d\nA number of developers have argued \u00a0that the security flaw in blockchain technology is its requirement to achieve distributed consensus on new security measures.\nUpdates to software in blockchain are inhibited because a majority who run the software must agree to the rollout.\nHowever, Morgan takes a different view:\n\u201cWe already have systems that are centralized, controllable and can be censored \u2014 like Ripple. They are not novel. They are not disruptive. They are business-as-usual with the word \u201cblockchain\u201d painted on as a thin veneer of innovation. Decentralized consensus is the innovation that matters.\u201d\n\u201cOverall, I attribute the hacks in our industry as symptoms of growing pains in a fast moving space. Certainly some are caused by sloppiness, bad actors, and the re-introduction of centralization, but I believe most of it is simple human error in the face of unexplored territory and complexity. We simply don\u2019t understand all the risks and there\u2019s only one way to learn \u2014 real money, real risk, real people.\u201d\n\u201cEventually security functions smart contracts will be built by combining battle-hardened and mature modules for common functionality \u2014 much like cryptographic libraries and random number generators, people will not write their own. Until then, we try, we test, we fail and we try again. As these systems iterate and mature, they become more and more secure, more useful, and therefore more valuable.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 28}

It also looked at economic modeling and forecasting across 25 countries and expert opinions from over 40 market leaders, economists, technologists and investment specialists.\nAccording to the report, broad based changes in the finance industry are upon us. This can be witnessed in the rise of women investors in North America and the growth of the middle class in emerging markets. At the same time, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, blockchain, and real-time analytics are a few of the smart technologies that investment providers are embracing.\nAs a result, it is predicted that by 2021, the convergence of these smart technologies will produce a huge impact on the wealth profession, unlocking the doors of global wealth across a diverse universe of investors. However, with a fast-paced marketplace, it is important for investors to understand their customers\u2019 needs and behaviors, and make the necessary technology changes to meet their requirements.\nBob Reynolds, President and CEO of Putnam Investments, commented in the report that \u2018the business moves in cycles, and some are severe.\u201d\nEven for experienced professionals the market can be a particularly difficult place. Consider the Great Recession of 2008, which saw industry leaders having to navigate their companies through a debt crisis, a market slowdown, and a drop in oil prices.\nAs a consequence, economist Dr. Nouriel Roubini said in the report that \u201cmediocre growth and low interest rates have become the new normal.\u201d\nHowever, while Roubini believes that a storm is looming, there are others who think that the biggest market upheaval will originate from within the industry.\n\u201cThe wealth sector is going through a tremendous, fast shift,\u201d said Dirk Klee, Chief Operating Officer of UBS. \u201cNot because of regulation or low interest rates, but from customers and their desire for a digitally enabled experience.\u201d\nThe report found that wealth service providers and investors agree that technology is revolutionizing the industry. From those surveyed 46 percent of service providers and 52 percent of investors believe that heightened competition and the growth of fintech companies are the main drivers of change over the next five years.\nWatching Emerging Markets\nThe report found that only 11 percent of firms and 31 percent of digital leaders have systems in place for monitoring next-generation technologies. In a bid to meet customers\u2019 needs, it\u2019s important to stay ahead of the game by catching new trends early.\nThe most influential technologies to watch are the fast-growing, smart technologies that can enhance a customer\u2019s experience and put one firm ahead of another. Technologies targeted for growth by 2021 include artificial intelligence at 128 percent, telematics at 72 percent, blockchain technology at 43 percent, and geospatial/location-based technology at 26 percent.\nAlex Tapscott, Founder and CEO of Northwest Passage Ventures, states in the report that blockchain is a game changer for the wealth profession. However, speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Spiros Margaris, venture capitalist and founder of Margaris Advisory, said that he believes blockchain technology will eventually be a game changer for some industries and could be a very attractive technology for the wealth management industry by cutting out the middleman and providing faster settlements at lower costs.\n\u201cHowever, in my opinion, it\u2019s over-hyped in its role as the magic bullet that will bring huge benefits and savings wherever it is applied,\u201d he added.\nInstead of blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are predicted to be more transformative for fintech by 2021. According to a\u00a0Forrester Research report released earlier this month, it is these two technologies that will provide fintech companies with a bigger opportunity to grow, helping to expand customer engagement levels over the next five years.\nMargaris agrees, stating that companies seeking opportunities to grow and expand will see faster results by investing in AI and IoT compared to blockchain.\n\u201cWe are at the early stage where the blockchain industry is still searching to find the best use cases for a mainstream adoption,\u201d he said.\n\u00a0A Relatively New Market\nBlockchain was first outlined in 2008, but as a relatively new technology it has garnered plenty of interest, particularly among financial services companies. According to the report, 45 percent of providers say that they are now exploring blockchain, while 64 percent expect to expand their use in five years.\nOf course, while there is a lot of interest in blockchain, the broader picture demonstrates that experimentation characterizes most of its current use, such as happens in technology accelerators, and that more needs to be done to increase its adoption.\n\u201cThe more companies, from incumbents to fintech startups, experiment with proof of concepts for blockchain implementations, however crazy or useless they might seem at first glance, the faster we will see real advances and benefits happening,\u201d Margaris said.\nWhile blockchain use-case breakthroughs might not happen in the next five years, Margaris is of the opinion that the likelihood of this happening will increase due to investments made in the sector and the many participants who want to benefit from a possible breakthrough.", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 29}

It is much more than that. It's a pervasive negative attitude regarding globalization that includes various autonomous and sometimes antagonistic movements, such as anti-Western universalism in Eurasia, anti-federalism in Eastern Europe, Piketty-type\u00a0neo-Marxism in Western Europe, as well as the Islamic State and the like from the Mediterranean to Central Asia.\nWhat's at stake here is the post World War II intellectual construct positing that if people from all civilizations find it profitable to be acquainted through exchange, they will become interdependent and identify with mankind as a whole, peacefully.\nGlobalization is losing ground fast to de-globalization \u2014 the view that a globalized economy generates intolerable inequalities between people, classes, nations and civilizations. To combat inequality, the argument goes, governments need to regain their sovereign rights and close their national borders.\nInequality within societies has widened considerably in recent decades. But this is not because of international trade or movements of people; after all, cross-border trade and migration have been happening for thousands of years. So what is fueling it? To answer that question, we must consider what it is about globalization that is generating returns for the wealthy. The reply: the capacity to combine.\nA central aspect of globalization is the careful documentation of the knowledge and legal tools needed to combine sovereign rights and property rights over seemingly useless single assets (electronic parts, legal rights to production, and so on) into complex wholes (an iPhone), and appropriate the surplus value they generate.\nIt is well-organized knowledge documented in clear and accessible ledgers that faithfully describes not only who controls what and where, but also the rules governing potential combinations, which makes it possible for the multiple components from ten countries to be brought together to manufacture one wooden pencil in Germany; it is also the story behind the hundreds of combinations that are required to assemble a mechanical Swiss watch and the thousands that it took to create flight navigation systems in the U.S. or over the world wide internet.\nIt is also the knowledge that informs us which authority has the sovereign right to regulate exchange, who has the property rights to any given asset and who can use both of these rights to leverage that asset. That is also how we know what can be leveraged and whether a given document can be used to perform over a dozen functions that are required to make complex combinations, including those acting as pledges against investment, collateral for credit, credentials for receiving public services and property rights containers to capture and store the surplus value created by the combinations.\nAfter two decades of fieldwork in some 20 countries with over 1,000 researchers, my organization, the Institute for Liberty and Democracy (ILD), has ascertained that 5 billion people \u2014 out of 7.3 billion around the world \u2014 are not documented in national ledgers or in anything approaching a manner easy to compare, measure or mix on an international scale. Instead, their entrepreneurial talents and legal rights to assets are recorded in hundreds of scattered records and rules systems throughout their countries, making them internationally inaccessible.\nThe Missing Links in the Legal Chain and Blockchain\nThis lack of consolidated, documented knowledge \u2014 and not trade \u2014 is the principal reason for global inequality. The lawyers and politicians who draft and enact the legislation and regulations that govern globalization are dramatically disconnected from those who are supposed to implement the policies at the local level, and those who write up and control the ledgers that embody the social contracts that are respected on the ground. In other words, the legal chain is missing a few crucial links.\nExperience in Japan, the United States and Europe shows that putting in place a straightforward legal approach to ensuring equal rights and opportunities can take a century or more. But there is a faster way: treating the missing links as a break not in a legal chain, but in a knowledge chain.\nWe at the ILD know something about knowledge chains. We spent 15 years adding millions of people to the globalized legal system by bringing the knowledge contained in marginal ledgers into the legal mainstream \u2014 all without the help of sophisticated software. But we do not have decades more to spend on this process; we need to bring in billions more people, and fast, if we want globalization to be less unequal. That will require automation.\nOver a year ago, the ILD began \u2014 with seed funding from the Omidyar Network and the brilliant and patient coaching of Bill Tai from Silicon Valley \u2014 to determine whether information technology, and specifically blockchain (the transparent, secure, and decentralized online ledger that underpins Bitcoin), could enable more of the world's population to get in on globalization. The answer is a resounding yes.\nBy translating the language of the legal chain into a digital language \u2014 an achievement that required us to develop a set of 21 typologies \u2014 we have created a system that could do at least four important things:\nFirst, identify, locate and capture any ledger in the world and make it public;\nSecond, make compliance effective by digitally placing any international contract in the ledgers \u2014 local or global \u2014 where the reputation of the contracting parties is at stake and commitment is more likely;\nThird, we have been able to compress into 34 binary indicators the questions that computers have to ask captured ledgers to determine which provisions should be made in existing legislation to make globalization a more equal process;\nAnd, fourth, use those same 34 indicators to insert into \"blockchain smart contracts\" the links missing in the legal chain, so that globalized firms and non-globalized collectives can start making fair deals without needing to wait for local rules to adapt to global legislation.\nMaybe the language that will help us globalize in equal terms is not English but the binary language of automation.\nThis op-ed is a guest post by Hernando De Soto.

We\u2019ve been looking for a time and a group that was not just cryptonerds, but that was practical, who wanted to build applications, who wanted to make it about the users experience of something great \u2014 not just about the technology and the math.\u201d\nGigi Levy-Weiss, NFX Founding Partner, added:\n\u201cWe found the Synereo team to have a unique combination of cryptocurrency and modern digital finance understanding alongside a real understanding of developer requirements and the know-how of how to build strong developer tools.\u201d\nSynereo\u2019s website shows a total of $3.4 m raised in their current fundraising campaign during which the company is offering its\u00a0AMP cryptocurrency at a fixed price and equity to qualifying investors at\u00a0BnkToTheFuture.\nSynereo\u2019s Full Stack Blockchain Technology\nSynereo was one of the first companies to design its own blockchain \u201cstack\u201d rather than using Ethereum\u2019s or any other blockchain designs because, according to a blog on their website:\n\u201cContemporary Blockchain solutions are still slow, wasteful and impossible to scale, and are overall unsuited to support the types of applications we\u2019re used to on the net or for operating at the scale of Facebook or Twitter + Visa or Mastercard.\u201d\nThe blog talks about Synereo\u2019s own \u201cWorld Computer\u201d with billions of personal devices connected without a server farm or central point of control.\n\u201cSuch a world computer wouldn\u2019t only make the Internet virtually untouchable and censorship-resistant, it would also level the playing field and allow the commons to compete against the highly centralized leviathans of the contemporary tech industry.\u201d\nThe company maintains that all the major players in the decentralization space have gone with their own blockchain technology, mainly to control and \u201cown\u201d the technology at the base of their stack.\nAs described in a recent article here, the Synereo blockchain stack can be described as:\n\u201cA four-layer system consisting of (from bottom-up): new blockchain technology called \"RChain\" or \"Blockchain 2.0\"; a distributed storage and content delivery protocol called \"SpecialK\"; its programming language for smart contracts and distributed apps called Rholang; and then the applications themselves.\u201d\nRChain: The Core Element of Synereo\u2019s World Computer\nAccording to the company, RChain can solve well-known problems of classical blockchain technology and is able to make blockchain based systems faster, cheaper to maintain and \u201cinfinitely scalable.\u201d\nRChain\u2019s consensus protocol is based on the Casper Proof of Stake design designed by developers including Vitalik Buterin and Vlad Zamfir of Ethereum, Synereo\u2019s CTO Greg Meredith, Ethan Buchman of Tendermint, Rick Dudley of Eris Industries, and Aron Fisher of Colony. Casper provides a model where consensus is as cheap as possible for everyone, except for hackers conducting an attack.\nSynereo's most prominent application to date is the Social Network, which launched\u00a0as an alpha version in August.\nLike Steemit, the Social Network offers content on the network and rewards participants with Synereo\u2019s currency AMP.\n\"There\u2019s a lot of wisdom with regards to how to build useful applications that people appreciate that exists out here in Silicon Valley,\" said Konforty. \"I think that in the rush to build a new Internet, many of the other projects in the space threw away much of it, it being tainted in their mind through association with the existing centralized model. At Synereo, we\u2019re all pragmatics: we take the good, implement it in the new paradigm, and leave the exploitative, old models behind.\"\n", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 30}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nIt is generally accepted that latency in block propagation is one of the bottlenecks for Bitcoin scaling. This is why many of Bitcoin\u2019s most active developers and researchers have presented a series of solutions to compress blocks and speed up propagation over the past years.\nIt is not as well known that these solutions may not suffice on their own. Due to a practice called \u201cspy mining\u201d or \u201cpool-watcher mining,\u201d Bitcoin mining has increasingly come to rely on the data and network infrastructure provided by mining pools.\nAs a result, many mining pools are not necessarily incentivized to broadcast their blocks to the network as fast as they can \u2014 regardless of latency in block propagation.\nSelfish mining\nTo understand how this is possible, let\u2019s first take a brief look at an older concept: \u201cselfish mining.\"\nIn short, selfish mining is a type of attack where miners find new blocks, but do not immediately broadcast these blocks to the network. The miners do, however, mine on top of any new found block they find themselves: they are mining \u201cselfishly.\u201d This gives them a head start to find the next block, while all other competitors are wasting their resources mining on top of an older block.\nBut hiding a new block is also risky. While a selfish miner hides a block, competitors may find a competing block. If this competing block makes its way through the network before the selfish miner\u2019s block does, the selfish miner would have wasted its own resources by hiding the block: the block is now worthless.\nFor selfish mining to be profitable, therefore, the attacker requires a significant amount of hash power on the network \u2014 some 25 to 30 percent at least. And more than half of all hash power on the network is surely enough. Though, with a majority of hash power, the attack perhaps starts to resemble a 51 percent attack and not just a selfish mining attack.\nA \u201cselfish 51-percent attack,\u201d if you will.\nLuckily, no miner (or mining pool) currently controls over half of all hash power on the Bitcoin network, or even 25 percent. At least not directly...\nValidationless Mining\nA lot of miners do engage in a type of \u201cvalidationless mining\u201d or (less accurately termed) \u201cSPV mining.\"\nA Bitcoin block consists of several pieces of data: transactions, a timestamp, a nonce and more. One important piece of data is a reference to the previous block: the block header hash. The block header hash can only be generated using the block header of the previous block, which can in turn only be generated using all data in that block. The idea is that a miner cannot mine a new block before it has seen the previous block.\nBut there is a bit of a loophole. Using only the block header hash, miners can try and find the next block just as well \u2014 even without knowing the previous block header, nor any of the other data in the previous block.\nThis can potentially come in handy. If miners can get a block header hash before receiving an actual block, they can try and find a new block more quickly, which allows them to be more profitable.\nAnd as it turns out, there is indeed a way for miners to often get a block header hash before receiving an actual block.\nSpy mining\nThe mining pools that today account for most blocks mined on the network really consist of many individual miners: e.g., \u201chashers.\u201d These hashers are all trying to find a new block on behalf of their pool, using a block header hash they received from their pool.\nA pool, of course, wants its connected hashers to mine on top of a new block as soon as possible. So if a pool finds a new block, it immediately sends the block header hash to all its hashers for them to mine on top of. And since this block header hash consists of minimal data, and because there is a direct connection between the pool and all hashers, the block header hash typically gets to these hashers very quickly.\nThis is where spy mining comes in.\nCompeting miners (including competing mining pools) can receive this block header hash from the mining pool as well. They simply need to connect to the pool, much like all the hashers. But instead of hashing for the pool, these miners then take the block header hash and mine on top of it for themselves. They\u2019re spy mining.\nThe pool that has the block header hashes may not even notice the difference between real hashers, and the spy miners. And if the pool does notice the difference, it may not even care. There\u2019s no real disadvantage for the pool.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, therefore, over half of all miners on the network (by hash power) currently engage in spy mining.\nSmaller Problems\nUnfortunately, spy mining \u2014 like all validationless mining \u2014 does present some problems.\nSpy miners can\u2019t check block header hashes for validity; they need all the other block data for that (the transactions, the nonce, etc). As such, spy miners have to place some trust in the mining pools they get the block header hashes from. This means that if the mining pool mines invalid blocks, it can \u2014 in a worst case scenario \u2014 lead to blockchain forks. (Much like the 2015 BIP66 blockchain fork.)\nAdditionally, mining pools can abuse the trust placed in them, especially if they can identify their spy mining competitors; for example, by feeding corrupt block header hashes to (some of) the spy miners. This tactic can cause spy miners to waste their resources, in turn making the Bitcoin network less secure.\nAnd, until they receive the full block, spy miners can only mine empty blocks; that\u2019s the only way to ensure they don\u2019t include any double-spend transactions. This means that the total number of transactions throughput on the Bitcoin network is lower than it could be.\nLuckily, however, in part thanks to several safeguards applied by spy miners, these problems are all relatively minor. While probably not ideal, risks to the Bitcoin network are limited.\nBroadcasting\nWidespread engagement in spy mining, however, enables a bigger problem.\nBecause so many miners (and pools) are spy mining, each time a mining pool finds a block and transmits the block header hash, this mining pool effectively directs a majority of all hash power to mine on top of that block \u2014 immediately. As such, there is no longer a big risk of this block being rejected and discarded for a competing block. Most of the network already accepts this block through the block header hash.This practice, in turn, allows mining pools to launch selfish 51 percent attacks, simply by delaying broadcasting their new blocks to the network. More specifically, it allows mining pools to launch selfish 51 percent attacks against any miner that does not engage in spy mining, and against some identified spy miners. While a mining pool and its spy miners get a headstart mining on top of the new block, all other miners waste their resources. (At least for some time, depending on the safeguards imposed by spy miners.)\nAmazingly, this even means that mining pools can gain advantage by being sloppy. Mining pools can, for instance, benefit from buggy software that delays broadcasting blocks by a few seconds \u2014 or more than a few.\nAlthough mining pools should want to broadcast their blocks to the network as fast as they can, widespread engagement in spy mining seems to have skewed these incentives for the worse \u2014 with no clear solution in sight.", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 30}

Its mission is to bring together leading healthcare enterprises in order to advance distributed ledger solutions that address the unique issues and regulatory regimes of the healthcare industry.\nIn a keynote address at Distributed: Health in Nashville, Tennessee, Hashed Health COO Corey Todaro told an audience of healthcare industry and blockchain specialists about the company\u2019s multi-pronged approach.\nFirst, the Hashed Health Consortium brings healthcare enterprises across the spectrum together to learn about blockchain technologies. These industry leading healthcare organizations will participate in working groups in order to solve concrete business problems in the healthcare industry, addressing a multitude of issues such as revenue cycles, data sharing, payment reform, insurance and supply chain provenance.\nMember organizations will be drawn from across the healthcare industry. According to Todaro, this scope of expertise will make the Hashed Health Consortium unique, especially compared to other business consortia. \u201cWe include a broad range of types of organizations. Payers and providers, EMR (electronic medical record) and other data companies, supply chain companies, revenue cycle companies and middlemen, pharma, services and consulting can all have a seat at the table.\u201d\nThe second level is a Development Studio focused on protocol-level implementation structures for those healthcare initiatives that have the most potential for immediate commercial traction. The Consortium will feed its ideas into the Development Studio, which will then seek to engineer those solutions from the proof of concept (PoC) stage through business-level application development, and eventually go on to full product development and commercialization.\nFor the remainder of the calendar year, Hashed Health will focus on growing the initial consortium membership, with the intention of holding its first Hashed Health Consortium membership meeting in Q1 of 2017; the Development Studio will be gearing up for PoC production within that same timeframe, with a goal of producing four PoCs, per year beginning in 2017.\n\u201cWe want to be a vendor-neutral technology forum to apply the best technology to the best use case,\u201d said Todaro. \u201cNot every chain or platform idea will work with every proof of concept. We don\u2019t want to try to control or generate a single chain for all of health care \u2014 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible \u2014 but we want to bring the best-of-breed of the development cycle into collaboration with Hashed Health consortium members to generate that proof of concept.\u201d\nHyperledger Healthcare Working Group\nAlso announced at the same Distributed: Health conference was a new working group launched by Hyperledger. The Hyperledger Healthcare Working Group (HLHC Working Group) has the mission \u201cto house and foster technical and business-level conversation about appropriate applications for blockchain technology in the healthcare industry.\u201d\nIn his address, Todaro announced that Hashed Health is joining the HLHC Working Group as a member \u201cto work on the protocol and library levels, to ensure that the blockchain libraries and protocols have the prerequisites necessary for implementation in healthcare.\u201d\nRationale\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve all seen IT applications that come in and say, well, there\u2019s a lot of innovation here but you\u2019re going to have to change your workflow significantly,\u201d said Todaro. \u201cThat just doesn\u2019t fly in healthcare. You can\u2019t tell the units in your hospital that they\u2019ve got to substantially change the way that they do things now to get a marginal benefit in technology.\u201d\nHe pointed out that if the technology is not adapted to workflows and doesn\u2019t meet the expectations of the end users, \u201cit doesn't matter how innovative the blockchain backend is \u2014 it\u2019s not going to fly.\u201d\nBy bringing all the levels of discourse together \u2014 \u00a0the enterprise-specific business applications; the value-added systems of API libraries, consensus protocols and permission policies; and HLCC Working Group protocol level experts \u2014 \u00a0Hashed Health can focus its development efforts from the top level, bringing in healthcare partners and the open source community to ensure it comes up with a full stack that meets the unique needs and expectations of the healthcare community.\n\u201cThis is a pre-competitive technology,\u201d said Todaro. \u201cPeople who come to the table now will set the terms for how blockchain gets implemented and how it gets understood by other stakeholders.\u201d\nImage: Corey Todaro of Hashed Health and Charles Martin of Martin Ventures at Distributed: Health, October 3, 2016 (Courtesy of Charles Bailey)", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 4}

This customized use of the GemOS blockchain was created to demonstrate the potential for automated reconciliation of medical data between providers, payers and financial institutions.\nWhat is GemOS?\nGemOS is a proprietary technology that can be used across any blockchain. The white paper outlining the platform was released on October 2.\nEssentially, GemOS is an infrastructure established for the deployment of decentralized applications and platforms. Using Gem, financial institutions, healthcare companies, and a wide range of data-reliant corporations will be able to connect existing systems into the GemOS blockchain network, which automates the management and sharing of data and identities within the linked systems.\nThe major difference between GemOS and previously introduced cloud-based systems is the increased scalability and speed of real-time access to data and identities that its blockchain grants to anyone within the network.\nFaster automated processes combined with the additional security measures that come with a blockchain allow the integration of microservices-based architecture for any organization that relies on the transfer and management of sensitive data.\nThe integration of the GemOS blockchain will enable companies with high data volume to regulate access to resources among employees, consumers and partnered organizations, without the issuance of temporary database access needed in traditional cloud-based platforms.\nRevenue Cycle Management: Proof of Concept Unveiled \nIn April, Gem launched the Gem Health Network (GHN), a network for developing applications and shared infrastructure for healthcare powered by the Ethereum blockchain.\nThrough the utilization of smart contracts and a unified network for the management of data, Gem Health constructs a transparent cross-institutional network in which healthcare companies as well as partner organizations are able to share sensitive information, such as medical data and certifications, in a protected ecosystem.\nTraditional cloud-based infrastructures designed to handle the management and sharing of complex forms of data are expensive and inefficient for information-reliant industries like the healthcare market, due to the volume of data, medical records and claims being exchanged by healthcare institutions and financial service providers on a daily basis.\nThe Revenue Cycle Management pilot is an example of how the GemOS platform\u00a0could be used to processing cross-industry data with lower costs and improved security measures.\n\u201cWe are using GemOS to create a pilot network around a specific use case that can be scaled into a full ecosystem,\u201d says Winkelspecht. \u201cThat is when blockchain-enabled business logic can begin to flow between market partners and unlock value.\u201d\nRCM is structured to \u201cautomate reconciliation of claims\u201d between companies and consumers.\u00a0The RCM pilot interface, unveiled at Distributed: Health, demonstrates a clear example of how patient-provider-payer facing systems could be seamlessly and securely integrated and implemented.\n\u201cThe vast amount of data that flows in and out of a simple medical claim creates impact beyond that workflow,\u201d says Winkelspecht. \u201cOur partners want to use this data to solve real problems that affect the industry today, and we believe the solution requires network integrity that is independent of a central administrator.\u201d\nFor data-based management systems in the healthcare industry, GemOS could potentially operate as the core platform for an entire data-reliant ecosystem, automating the majority of technological operations in companies through one single network.\nA unified blockchain ecosystem would lead to simpler and more secure interactions between companies and users, enabling the deployment of cross-industry applications.", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 4}

In fact, letting the citizens express their preference on important issues, bypassing the intermediation of politicians, is often desirable.\nWhy, then, isn\u2019t direct democracy used more often? One reason is that it costs money to organize and run elections. Another is that voting is still a 20th century (or 19th century) process that requires physically going to a place, or in the best cases, sending paper documents via snail mail. Therefore, voting is often too much of a hassle for 21st century citizens, who are now used to doing most things online, without leaving home.\nOn October 2, the citizens of Hungary were called to a referendum to choose whether or not to accept refugee quotas imposed by the European Union. While the issue has raised and continues to raise impassioned debates in Hungary (and other European countries,) less than half of the population voted. That was partly due to the fact that minority opposition parties told their supporters to stay home, in order to invalidate the results of a referendum they couldn\u2019t win. But another reason is that many voters couldn\u2019t be bothered.\nTypically, only half or fewer than half of eligible voters vote in a referendum, which, together with the costs, makes direct democracy impractical. The average participation in administrative and political elections isn\u2019t much higher. It seems clear that the world needs electronic voting (e-voting). Ideally, we should vote online, just as we do e-banking from home.\n\u201cSince the turn of the century, e-voting has been considered a promising and (eventually) inevitable development, which could speed up, simplify and reduce the cost of elections, and might even lead to higher voter turnouts and the development of stronger democracies,\u201d notes a recent European Parliament document titled \u201cWhat if blockchain technology revolutionised voting?\u201d The document is one of the \u201cWhat if\u2026\u201d essays in the Think Tank section of the European Parliament website, dedicated to \u201cdocuments that help shape new EU legislation.\u201d\nThe author, Philip Boucher, is a member of the Scientific Foresight services in the Science and Technology Options Assessment (STOA) team of the European Parliament. According to Boucher, we have two choices: \u201cto continue trusting central authorities to manage elections, or to use blockchain technology to distribute an open voting record among citizens.\u201d\nSecurity is an open and challenging issue for e-voting. Of course, other aspects of \u201ce-life,\u201d such as e-banking, present important security concerns as well. In e-banking, appropriately high security is typically achieved through multi-factor authentication, and some high-security applications use biometrics as well. One difference is that society is supposed to guarantee easy access to voting to everyone, regardless of income or education. Therefore, it seems likely that blockchain enabled e-voting will be deployed in private organizations first.\n\u201cUsually, votes are recorded, managed, counted and checked by a central authority,\u201d notes Boucher. \u201cBlockchain-enabled e-voting (BEV) would empower voters to do these tasks themselves, by allowing them to hold a copy of the voting record.\u201d\nA possible approach to BEV is to create new blockchains tailored to e-voting, and perhaps even to specific elections and demographics. Similar approaches are often preferred by regulators and bureaucrats, but Boucher is more bold and creative. \u201cA second approach that may be cheaper and easier is to \u2018piggyback\u2019 running the election on a more established blockchain, such as that used by the virtual currency, bitcoin,\u201d says Boucher. \u201cGiven that the security of a blockchain ledger relies upon the breadth of its user base, this piggyback approach may also be more secure for elections with a small number of voters.\u201d It\u2019s interesting to note the similarity of this argument with those put forward by cryptographer Nick Szabo in favor of the open, permissionless Bitcoin blockchain.\nIt seems evident that BEV would be cheaper than the current voting system. But one of the sources cited by Boucher is skeptical about the other advantage of e-voting mentioned above \u2014 that e-voting would boost turnout. In fact, the younger \u201cdigital natives\u201d who would find BEV natural and easy are, according to surveys, not very interested in voting.\nThere could be other political advantages of BEV though. \u201cThe debate is whether blockchain will represent a transformative or merely incremental development, and what its implications could be for the future of democracy,\u201d notes Boucher. \u201cBEV would shift power and trust away from central actors, such as electoral authorities, and foster the development of a tech-enabled community consensus.\u201d\nOne of the references given by Boucher is a Bitcoin Magazine interview with Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, the founder and CEO of Bitnation, a blockchain-based \u201cGovernance 2.0\u201d initiative, with a collaborative platform for DIY governance. \u201cWe believe we\u2019ll make both nation states governments, as well as organizations like the U.N. irrelevant, simply through providing cheaper, more secure and better Do-It-Yourself governance services,\u201d said Tarkowski Tempelhof in another Bitcoin Magazine interview.\nBoucher, an officer of a European organization, would probably question the desirability of the outcome advocated by Tarkowski Tempelhof. But the fact remains that some of the considerations in the European Parliament paper suggest decentralized politics is a desirable outcome. This is, to say the least, refreshing.\n\u201c[BEV] is managed by the people and it is transparent, decentralized and bottom-up,\u201d explains Boucher. \u201cWhile participation in traditional elections reinforces the authority of the state, participation in BEV asserts the primacy of the people. In this light, it is not surprising that links are drawn between BEV and transitions towards a more direct, decentralized and bottom-up democracy.\u201d\nImage credit: By Keith Bacongco - http://www.flickr.com/photos/kitoy/1597912606/, CC BY 2.0 https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=29436258", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 5}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nTeambrella, the innovative Bitcoin-based peer-to-peer insurance company, recently released a demo-version of its service. In anticipation of the product launch, anyone can now experience what Teambrella will look like and test how it will work.\nTo gauge the process on Teambrella, Bitcoin Magazine spoke with Alex Paperno, one of three developers behind the project.\nThe demo\u2019s purpose \u201cis somewhat similar to a Minimum Viable Product: to gather input from potential users which we use to improve the platform before we launch,\u201d said Paperno.\nTeambrella is set to become the first decentralized bitcoin-based insurance company, where users insure each other. While Teambrella itself is not decentralized, Bitcoin\u2019s multi-signature addresses allow users to manage the entire flow of funds in a trustless and decentralized manner. Users retain strong control over their own money at all times, while reputation systems incentivize everyone to pay each other out when needed. If Teambrella gains traction, (semi)professional insurance agents may even emerge within the system, to decrease potential fraud and streamline the insurance process for all participants.\nInitially, the Teambrella platform will allow for two types of insurance. One is deductible supplement coverage for collision insurance. This covers the out-of-pocket expenses customers have to pay unless they take on a relatively expensive insurance policy. The other is pet insurance, which will cover veterinary bills. The available types of insurance will expand in the future, but the Teambrella development team believes it\u2019s best to keep the options relatively basic at first.\n\u201cWe don't want to allow users to create any possible type of insurance right from the start,\u201d Paperno explained, \u201cbecause a lot of types can't be easily handled without making some changes to Teambrella. An obvious example would be an insurance that insures against natural disasters. These would require additional reinsurance for cases when a lot of \u2018policy holders\u2019 \u2014 teammates in our case \u2014 \u00a0have insured incidents at the same time.\u201d\nDemo Version Features\nThe demo version of Teambrella lets users play around as the fictional user \u201cJohn Smith,\u201d who represents part of a team for deductible supplement coverage. Although the demo version uses play money and includes only fake team members, the platform is fully operational. Testers can open claims, vote on claims by other users, issue proxy votes to team members and do just about everything else that Teambrella will enable.\nWith the launch of the demo, most of the work on the technical side of Teambrella has been completed. The development team will now focus on polishing the user interface and work on fixing any bugs that may be found. Additionally, the open-source clients with which users will connect to Teambrella\u2019s servers should be uploaded to GitHub next month.\nThe Teambrella team also intends to build a bit of a community before they launch and potentially garner investments; mostly in order to promote the project.\u201cFor a platform like Teambrella, user participation is crucial,\u201d said Paperno. \u201cIt\u2019s the classic chicken-and-egg problem: joining an insurance like this only makes sense if there\u2019s people to insure you. We'd therefore like to build as big a community as we can before we launch, so Teambrella won't flop when it\u2019s finally released.

According to the economists, adopting leading-edge fintech could create 15,000 jobs in Scotland over 10 years and failing to do so would have the opposite effect.\n\u201cFintech is evolving at a rapid pace and the consequences of digitalisation are being hailed as a \u2018game changer\u2019 for both the banking and securities industries,\u201d said Daniel Broby, director of the Strathclyde University\u2019s Centre for Financial Regulation and Innovation.\n\u201cFinancial transactions are set to become instantaneous, traditional paper money is being replaced by digital money and entrepreneurs will be able to raise money directly from the public,\u201d added Broby. \u201cAll this is good news for the consumer. But it is critical that we create the right conditions to enable companies to develop fintech faster, if Scotland\u2019s financial sector is to remain globally competitive. The technology exists. Either Scottish financial institutions adopt it and thrive, or they ignore it at their peril.\u201d\nThe warning came at a symposium on the future of fintech held last Friday, September 2, at the University of Strathclyde\u2019s Technology and Innovation Centre.\nThe Strathclyde economists are persuaded that fintech is being driven by blockchain technology and distributed ledgers, two major innovations poised to transform the way the financial sector handles not only payments but also identity, transactions and debt information.\nBroby argued that the adoption of advanced fintech should be accelerated. \u201cThere\u2019s potentially a huge opportunity for Scotland but we need to seize it,\u201d he said.\nBroby and co-author Tatja Karkkainen presented a conference whitepaper titled \u201cFintech in Scotland: Building a digital future for the financial sector.\u201d\nThe potential for a Scottish digital currency \u2014 a local currency backed by the Scottish parliament and banks \u2014 is examined in Broby\u2019s whitepaper and it has been discussed at the symposium.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the possibility of a Scottish national digital currency was also discussed in connection with the Scottish independence referendum in September 2014. The referendum failed, but the possibility of a new referendum surfaced again after the U.K. voters chose Brexit, the exit of the U.K. from the European Union, on June 23. In fact, Scottish voters chose to stay in the E.U. and Scottish politicians declared that they would put the referendum back on the table. However, Broby\u2019s proposal could be implemented even if Scotland were to remain a part of the U.K.\n\u201cWe present the case for a Scottish backed crypto currency,\u201d says Broby in the whitepaper. \u201cMost crypto currencies have been developed by the private sector. Scotland could either host such an initiative or develop its own. This could be done by providing the backbone in the form of an encrypted distributed ledger. As a sponsored initiative, a copy of the transactions could also be mirrored in a central registry. This could be maintained by the Scottish government. The advantage of this is that there remains an element of oversight, be it for tax or money laundering. This would prove easier to regulate than a mined and anonymous blockchain.\n\u201cThe rationale for a Scottish digital currency is supported by its unique political positioning,\u201d continues Broby. \u201cLegally, there is no need to have the legal capacity to issue banknotes to set up a cryptographically enabled transaction system. As long as a bank or group of banks is willing to guarantee the exchange of the currency to sterling (or a menu of exchangeable currencies) then the system could be just run from a [distributed] ledger.In most countries it is only central banks who are permitted to issue currency. In Scotland, Bank of Scotland, Clydesdale Bank and The Royal Bank of Scotland currently issue banknotes. Scottish Banknotes are legal currency in as much as they are approved by the UK Parliament. Scottish banknotes are not technically legal tender even in Scotland but the widespread use has established a precedent which can be built on. The Scottish payment system currently exists without a legal framework.\u201d\n\u201cThis legal ambiguity can be used to issue Scottish digital currency, backed by deposits from these currencies with the Bank of England,\u201d concludes Broby. \u201cThe Scottish Parliament would have to support the initiative and presumably pass legislation on [digital currencies] to ensure its success.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 9}

Currently the 6th most valuable blockchain token by market cap, Ethereum Classic is valued at $124 million.\n\u201cMillions of people across the world are beginning to take advantage of blockchain, a revolutionary technology with transformative power,\u201d said Anthony Di Iorio, CEO of Jaxx. \u201cThe hard-forked version of Ethereum has already been approved by Apple and we hope that Apple will allow the addition of Ethereum Classic, especially given its wide array of developer support and steadily growing popularity.\u201d\nLike Dash, Ethereum Classic is now integrated into the other apps in Jaxx\u2019s wallet suite including on Android, Mac OS, Windows and Linux, as well as in its Chrome and Firefox extensions. However, unlike Dash, there is still hope that Apple will approve its iOS integration for ETC shortly.\n\n\u201cAdding Ethereum Classic makes a lot of sense for Jaxx, a pro-technology, pro-blockchain wallet. After the successful integration of Dash last month and now ETC, Jaxx currently has five tokens fully supported. We\u2019re proud to be among the first to embrace the future, multi-coin world.\u201d\n\nDash Integration Rejected by Apple Store; Six Other Tokens Accepted\nIn an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Di Iorio spoke about the news regarding Apple's directive to remove Dash from its iOS app.\nAccording to\u00a0Coin Market Cap, Dash is the world\u2019s eighth most popular digital currency by market cap. However, despite this, Apple has stated that they are only accepting six coins/tokens: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Litecoin, DAO tokens and Ripple.\n\u201cWhen trying to ask for more information about the rationale behind the decision, they will not provide information on that,\u201d Di Iorio said. \u201cThey would not say anything about why or why not and they are tight-lipped on that.\u201d\nAfter speaking with Apple developer support who confirmed Dash is not on their accepted list of digital currencies, Di Iorio added that Apple has given them until September 16 to remove Dash from the iOS version of the Jaxx wallet. It won\u2019t affect any of their other platforms such as Android, tablet or mobile.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal to us, but it\u2019s unfortunate to iOS users because as the technology advances very quickly, it\u2019s very difficult for developers to know if things will be accepted or not and why,\u201d said Di Iorio. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know what the playing field is when we\u2019re trying to apply to the iOS store and there doesn\u2019t seem to be much rationale behind which coins to accept.\u201d\nDi Iorio said\u00a0that he didn\u2019t understand the basis behind Apple's decision to accept DAO tokens, but not Dash.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t even know anything about DAO until we put our app up because we were the first DAO wallet,\u201d he stated. \u201cI don\u2019t know what their rationale behind it is and I don\u2019t want to speculate, but I don\u2019t know why it makes any difference to them what users are storing in their wallets.\u201d\nHe went on to say that while it was an unfortunate turn of events, he hoped that Apple would provide a clearer statement as to why some coins are accepted and why some aren\u2019t.\nBefore the issue with Apple, Di Iorio said it was an easy decision to support Dash. \u201cThe Dash community was very responsive and positive and very easy to work with. It\u2019s a good community and it was a very good fit for us.\u201d\nInterestingly enough, Apple had initially approved and accepted Dash into its store. The timeline illustrates that Jaxx had prepared their first application to add Dash to Apple on August 12. After several updates, it wasn\u2019t until August 22 that it was ready for sale.\nHowever, Di Iorio says that Apple ended up calling him a few days later to inform him that the addition of Dash had been a mistake and that it could have to be removed.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time, though, that Apple has taken a stance against digital currencies. In 2014, it took action against bitcoin, but after a backlash from the digital currency community, Apple later reversed its position and reinstated the bitcoin wallet in the Apple store.\nBringing the Community Together\nAccording to Di Iorio, the main thing is to bring the blockchain community together and to provide an interface for that community.\n\u201cWe do that by being agnostic; we do that by thinking everyone should be working together,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about Ethereum versus Bitcoin, or Dash versus Bitcoin.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the technology and that\u2019s what we try to promote. We\u2019re here to bring the tools and bring the blockchain to the masses, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do with our product to make it easy for users to use, no matter what blockchain they want to use.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 7}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nThe vast majority of economists seem to have a serious distaste for Bitcoin. Whenever an economist who has received a Nobel Prize, teaches at an Ivy League school or works at a central bank comments on Bitcoin, they always seem to have something negative to say about the technology. Some of these individuals simply say that Bitcoin has no future whatsoever, while others go as far as to claim it is pure evil.\nPaul Krugman, who won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Economics, has ridiculed Bitcoin on multiple occasions. Late last month, fellow Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz shared his own disdain for the peer-to-peer digital cash system at the London School of Economics. Former International Monetary Fund Chief Economist Kenneth Rogoff also recently spoke negatively of Bitcoin, saying the U.S. Government should eventually ban the digital money, in addition to cash bills over $10.\nThere is no shortage of economists who want to see Bitcoin crash and burn.\nPaul Krugman Gets It Wrong on Bitcoin\nBefore getting into the recent comments from Stiglitz and Rogoff, let\u2019s take a closer look at Krugman\u2019s comments about Bitcoin over the years.\nIn his first post on Bitcoin, Krugman called it evil. \u201cI have to say that I\u2019m still deeply unconvinced,\u201d Krugman wrote in regard to whether Bitcoin could even work.\nThree years later, Bitcoin is still working and processing roughly 225,000 transactions per day.\nKrugman also didn\u2019t understand that censorship-resistant online transactions are the underpinning value of bitcoin, as Silk Road had illustrated that use case two years prior.\nIn 2014, Krugman went on to essentially call Bitcoin a scam.\u00a0In 2015, Krugman seemed to lack a basic understanding of Bitcoin when asked about it at The Genius of Economics. \u201cAt this point, bitcoin is not looking too good,\u201d he noted.\n\nAccording to BitcoinAverage.com, one bitcoin was trading at $279.63 the day Krugman made that statement. The price has more than doubled since then and is now above $600. In fact, bitcoin hit the bottom of its current rally a little under two months before Krugman\u2019s statement.\nOf course, Krugman\u2019s analysis wasn\u2019t as blatant or specific as that of Boston\u2019s University\u2019s Mark T. Williams, who infamously predicted a collapse of the bitcoin price to under $10 by the middle of 2014.\nHaving said that, it\u2019s difficult to find any correct points made by Krugman about Bitcoin up to this point.\nJoseph Stiglitz Chimes In\nAlthough Stiglitz hasn\u2019t talked about bitcoin much over the years, he appears to hold a view similar to Krugman\u2019s. \u201cMy own view is bitcoins have been greatly exaggerated, and a common medium of exchange and store of value is a basic public function and needs to be regulated,\u201d he recently stated at the London School of Economics. \u201cThe main use of bitcoins has been to circumvent tax authorities and regulation and I think the U.S. government did the right thing by trying to shut it down. And I think, effectively, it has done that.\u201d\nStiglitz is correct in that the main use case of Bitcoin is for regulatory arbitrage (outside of its use as a store of value), but his comments regarding a U.S. government shutdown of Bitcoin are unfounded. It\u2019s unclear what Stiglitz was referring to when he said the U.S. government tried to shut down (or effectively shut down) the peer-to-peer digital cash system.\nMuch like Krugman, Stiglitz reveals his disdain for Bitcoin due to its use in avoiding financial and monetary regulations.\nKen Rogoff Wants Less Cash in the World\nNow for Rogoff. This Professor of Economics and Public Policy at Harvard University would like to see Bitcoin banned if it gains further traction. \u201cYou have to play whack-a-mole with all these things,\u201d he stated during a recent appearance on CNBC. \u201cThere are always going to be these other things: gold coins, uncut diamonds, [and] now bitcoin.\u201d\n\u201c[Bitcoin] is at a very low scale now, and you can\u2019t go into the drug store and use it,\u201d Rogoff continued. \u201cThey\u2019ll prevent it in the future. They\u2019re, you know, allowing innovation.\u201d\nIn a recent article for Project Syndicate, Rogoff claimed governments have many tools at their disposal for limiting the use of bitcoin. The one example tool he provided was a ban on the acceptance of bitcoin by banks and retail stores.\nAlthough he doesn\u2019t want to get rid of cash completely, Rogoff would like to gradually remove bills larger than ten dollars from circulation. This, obviously, would have the side effect of making bitcoin an even more attractive offering for censorship-resistant transactions. In fact, a cashless (or in Rogoff\u2019s case, less-cash) society has the potential to create new opportunities for Bitcoin.\nIronically, Rogoff hints at the opportunity a less-cash society could create for Bitcoin in his aforementioned article. \u201cScaling back paper currency would hardly end crime and tax evasion; but it would force the underground economy to employ riskier and less liquid payment devices,\u201d he wrote.\nWhy Does This Hatred Exist?\nThe reasons these economists (and others) hate Bitcoin should be obvious. In their view, it is the government\u2019s job to regulate currency in an effort to provide greater stability for the economy. They also clearly believe the government should be able to decide what is and is not a legitimate or legal transaction.\nThis point of view is cited in the posts by Krugman, mentioned earlier in this article. In both of those pieces about Bitcoin, Krugman links to a Charlie Stross blog post titled, Why I Want Bitcoin to Die in a Fire.\nIn the piece, Stross complains about a variety of perceived issues with Bitcoin; including, the 21 million bitcoin cap, the amount of energy burned to secure the network, any possibility of anonymity or privacy within the system, how digital cash has incentivized the creation of new malware, uncensorable markets, and more.\n\u201cTo editorialize briefly, BitCoin [sic] looks like it was designed as a weapon intended to damage central banking and money issuing banks, with a Libertarian political agenda in mind \u2014 to damage states\u2019 ability to collect tax and monitor their citizens financial transactions,\u201d Stross concludes.\nIn other words, these economists would like the government to be able to regulate the economy and they view Bitcoin as a possible threat to that philosophy.\nThere are some economists, such as Robert Murphy, who have a more positive view of Bitcoin, but others like Murphy are the exception to the rule.\nWith the development of Segregated Witness, the Lightning Network, sidechains and TumbleBit, it appears these economists will have more to complain about in the coming years.", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 9}

Up until the 1970\u2019s, most paper currencies were backed in some shape or form by the barbaric relic. Due to the monetary folly of negative interest rates, western global savers are rediscovering the similar properties shared by money and the shiny metal.\nIn Germany, retail banks recently began charging their depositors to hold their money. This prompted an insecure flight to a cash under the mattress mentality. German savers began buying safes in record numbers. In addition, various gold exchange-traded products became even more popular.\nXetra-Gold is one of the most popular Exchange Traded Commodities (ETC). The key selling point is that clients can request delivery of the physical gold that their paper derivative represents at any time. Due to the financial chicanery of the past 7 years, investors rightfully do not completely trust that they own gold unless they can physically touch it.\nRecently GodModeTrader published a troubling report about an Xetra-Gold investor whose request for delivery was denied. Xetra-Gold is not some fly-by-night operation. Their fund has over 1.5 billion Euros in assets and is sponsored by Deutsche Bank.\nAfter this report gained traction on various online financial media outlets such as Zerohedge, Deutsche Borse and Deutsche Bank released a statement. The statement contained no substance and did not answer the crucial question: Why the client could not receive delivery of his physical gold?\nDue to social and governmental conditioning, most people place immense trust in the banking system. Events such as these, while widely reported on fringe financial media websites, are rarely covered by mainstream news outlets such as The Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal, or Bloomberg. However, the Bitcoin community is inherently skeptical about any organization that cannot deliver the physical asset on demand.\nWhat if Xetra-Gold had been a Bitcoin exchange? Every time a Bitcoin exchange is hacked, it makes the front page of the aforementioned publications. The most recent Bitfinex hack is a current example.\nBut if exchange-traded products with billions of Euros under management cannot make good on their fiduciary responsibilities, why is there not a bank run on these organizations? Why doesn\u2019t every holder of Xetra-Gold paper request delivery immediately and determine if the gold actually exists where it should?\nWhile gold has been the best store of wealth over many millennia, certain properties of the metal lead to third parties holding it on our behalf. Gold is heavy and voluminous; transporting and storing a large amount of gold is expensive. Gold can be forged; there are many instances where gold bars and coins have been found to include various amounts of tungsten or other cheaper metals. On-demand liquidity for gold can be tricky; buying and selling small quantities of physical gold is expensive due to the large bid / ask spreads of retail gold dealers.\nRetail savers want a scarce, non-governmentally controlled asset that can be bought or sold easily, and they can fully control at all times. The Xetra-Gold example illustrates the pitfalls of entrusting wealth to paper derivatives.\nBitcoin is scarce and not backed or controlled by any government. The genuineness of every bitcoin can be independently verified by anyone with an internet connection due to the public blockchain. Bitcoin can be bought or sold in tiny quantities 24 hours a day, with spreads tighter than the physical gold market. Most importantly, bitcoin can be stored for zero cost on free-to-download apps on any smartphone.\nBitcoin is volatile, but so is gold. In the spring of 2013, gold dropped 30 percent in a few hours. It is not uncommon to see 5 percent pumps or dumps in the gold markets in 5-minute candles. The volatility of bitcoin is not an excuse to disregard it as a means of wealth preservation.\nRetail savers escaping the insanity of negative interest rates should consider investing in bitcoin over gold. At least with bitcoin, you are in full control of your wealth at all times.\nThis op-ed is a guest post by Arthur Hayes.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nAs one of its most important properties and a key selling point, Bitcoin is not controlled by any government, (central) bank or company. Nor is there even an active inventor to call the shots, as is the case in many other open-source projects. But that doesn\u2019t mean the peer-to-peer electronic cash system is not governed by humans at all.\nMany attribute this governance role to the\u00a0Bitcoin Core development team. This is a misguided attribution, however. While Bitcoin Core developers may have an influential position, Bitcoin is really governed by only two groups of people: users and miners.\nBitcoin Implementations\nBitcoin itself is essentially nothing but a protocol; a language shared by computers. And importantly, Bitcoin is an \u201copen\u201d protocol: there are no gatekeepers or requirements to become part of the Bitcoin network, other than following this protocol.\nAnyone with the required skill-set can develop software to follow the protocol. But the easier option, of course, is to simply download and run software developed by others.\nThere are currently several Bitcoin software implementations to choose from, as well as forks (near copies) of these implementations. The\u00a0most used of these is probably still Bitcoin Core, the software stack that evolved from Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s original Bitcoin implementation. But\u00a0Libbitcoin,\u00a0Bitcoin XT*,\u00a0Bitcoin Classic* and a handful of other implementations all follow the same protocol too and exist on the same network side by side.\n(*Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic are programmed to deviate from the current Bitcoin protocol if certain conditions are met, but do follow the current Bitcoin protocol until then.)\nFrankly, all these implementations and forks are \u201cgoverned\u201d by their respective developers in whatever way these developers want. Where Bitcoin Classic developers set up a (non-binding) consider.it page to crowd-source ideas on the direction of development, former Bitcoin XT lead developer Mike Hearn was more willing to act as a \u201cbenevolent dictator.\u201d\nBitcoin Core is governed by a loosely meritocratic process of peer review and rough consensus among its\u00a0most active contributors. This is guided by the \u2014 theoretically implementation-independent \u2014 Bitcoin Improvement Proposal process and moderated by Bitcoin Core lead developer, Wladimir van der Laan, as well as several developers with commit access. Libbitcoin is governed in a similar fashion but with lead developer Eric Voskuil as its moderator.\nThe important thing, however, is that governance of Bitcoin implementations \u2014 including Bitcoin Core \u2014 is fundamentally distinct from governance of Bitcoin itself. Whatever code change Bitcoin developers adopt and release really only exists as a series of ones and zeros hosted on websites like\u00a0bitcoin.org or\u00a0bitcoincore.org. It has no bearing on the Bitcoin network itself.\nIt\u2019s only if actual Bitcoin users download and run a new release on their own computers that it can become part of the Bitcoin network. And, of course, developers have no control over which software people run on their own computers. Anyone who runs Bitcoin Core or any other Bitcoin implementation does so autonomously and voluntarily.\nDevelopers are, therefore, perhaps best understood as tool providers with what could be considered a sort of advisory role. Their influence is limited to offering people software they can use to connect to the Bitcoin network if they want to.\nGoverning the Protocol\nBitcoin governance itself ultimately emerges from users through the software they run on their computers.\nThis type of governance is perhaps best compared to human languages. While no single governing body has historically really been in charge of the English language, many people do voluntarily choose to apply the same grammar rules in order to communicate. People \u201cgovern\u201d the English language by using it.\nThose who communicate in English with many people \u2014 perhaps popular news anchors \u2014 will have a stronger influence on the English language. Those who communicate with fewer people, like secluded monks, will have a weaker influence. Similarly, the amount of influence Bitcoin users exert on the protocol depends on their participation.\nMore specifically, bitcoin is really only useful (and therefore valuable) if people accept it as payment. Accepting bitcoin as payment, therefore, adds value to the specific set of protocol rules applied to accept the payment.\nUsers that accept more payments (or payments of higher value) carry more weight within the network. If many Bitcoin users want to transact with\u00a0AlphaBay or\u00a0BitPay, such companies can have a greater impact on Bitcoin\u2019s protocol rules and, therefore, on Bitcoin\u2019s governance process.\nAnd since only fully validating Bitcoin nodes apply to all protocol rules, users who run these \u201cfull nodes\u201d have a stronger impact on Bitcoin\u2019s governance process as well.\nBitcoin developers \u2014 Core or otherwise \u2014 add weight to the Bitcoin protocol to the extent that they are users. But their status as developers grants them no special privilege, even if they wanted it to.\nChanging the Protocol\nApplying and enforcing existing protocol rules is easy. Changing Bitcoin\u2019s protocol rules is often much harder.\nSome protocol changes can be applied by a subset of participants of the Bitcoin network (kind of how slang can be applied by a subset of English speakers). But other protocol changes require network-wide agreement: consensus. Even small differences may cause different Bitcoin implementations to become entirely incompatible with each other. This could lead to a \u201cblockchain fork,\u201d splitting the Bitcoin network into two or more separate networks and, therefore, two or more separate currencies.\n(Which changes require consensus, and which do not, is explained in more detail\u00a0here.)\nSome incompatible changes to the Bitcoin protocol therefore require all users to apply the new rules at some agreed-upon point in time. Everyone must switch to an entirely new network, incompatible with the old network, or else two different networks will exist. Put differently; everyone must start using an entirely new \u201ccoin\u201d and must agree that this coin is the new bitcoin.\nThe real challenge, therefore, is not so much writing new code or even creating a new network. The real challange is convincing everyone to switch to this new network and consider it the new bitcoin.\nOnce again, Bitcoin developers have no special powers to make users switch to a new network \u2014 except to the extent that users may choose to follow their advice. Even if the Bitcoin Core developers were to release a new version of their software to create such a new network, users of the older software implementations could simply ignore the update and continue using the existing protocol as they please.\n(It should be noted that a subset of users can always opt to switch to a new network even if not everyone else agrees. It may just be unlikely that everyone will consider this new coin to be the \u201creal\u201d bitcoin.)\nSoft Forks\nGetting everyone to harmoniously switch to a new protocol is no easy task. That\u2019s why the current Bitcoin Core development team\u00a0prefers to change the protocol in such a way that not everyone needs to switch at the same time \u2014 or at all.\nThrough \u201csoft forks,\u201d the existing Bitcoin protocol can be changed within the bounds of the current protocol. They \u201climit\u201d the existing rules. Though through clever tricks \u2014 like\u00a0these\u00a0ones \u2014 soft forks can actually be deployed to expand Bitcoin\u2019s capabilities.\nSoft forks achieve this by deeming transactions that would previously have been considered valid as invalid. And since not all users, but only miners, decide which transactions are included in blocks, soft forks can be carried out by a mere majority of miners by hash power. (Any minority miner that doesn\u2019t switch may have its blocks rejected by the majority, while still following the majority chain; there can be no blockchain split.)\nIn today\u2019s relatively centralized mining landscape, where only a small subset of users mine (and an even smaller subset of users control mining pools), very few users can enforce soft forks. Bitcoin Core developers therefore only propose soft forks they believe should be uncontroversial. These soft forks also require 95 percent hash power support, rather than a mere majority. And they only propose soft forks that clearly signal that the protocol will change, so all users can upgrade their software or take alternative precautions, if that is what they want.\nOf course, miners can soft-fork without support from developers or Bitcoin\u2019s broader user base as well. But if miners act against user interests, there is a\u00a0possible solution. The Bitcoin protocol can be changed to require a new mining algorithm, instantly making specialized mining hardware obsolete. This should re-decentralize mining from industrial farms back to regular computers at least temporarily, effectively firing the current set of miners. Some Bitcoin Core developers\u00a0may\u00a0be\u00a0supportive of such a change in some instances. Once again, of course, developers could only propose such an incompatible change. Users would have to adopt it.", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 7}

I\u2019ll be talking about the goals and progress of the Hyperledger project at the conference, but I really intend to be in listening in conversation mode, to see what more we can do to collaborate with the China blockchain community and industry.\"\nThe Chinese government has organized a special government-industry working group to ensure that Chinese industry presents a concrete plan of action at the Summit outlining how best to go forward to promote the development and adoption of blockchain technology.\n\"Interest in blockchain technology, and in Hyperledger, has been huge in China,\u201d said Behlendorf. \u201cWe have fifteen members out of eighty based in China, not counting those companies like IBM with a substantial developer presence in China.\u201d\nWanxiang Bitcoin Lab\u2019s Summit, Demo Day and Ethereum\u2019s Devcon2\nThe week-long event includes the Ethereum Foundation Devcon2 developers conference, Wanxiang Blockchain Lab\u2019s (WBL) Demo Day and WBL's \"Summit\" events.\nHosted by Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, the Summit will focus on \u201caddressing current and future business use cases, economic and social impacts, as well as how blockchain technology may be utilized and deployed for trade and other industries,\u201d according to Chan.\nEthereum\u2019s Devcon2, running from September 19\u201321, will feature Ethereum developers who will introduce, present and discuss the latest developments in Ethereum research and development.\nThis will be Ethereum\u2019s second international development summit, an opportunity for hundreds of developers to share the latest information and their experiences working on the Ethereum blockchain. Devcon2 will also reach out to the Chinese development community to pool their resources. According to the event website, \u201cit will be a major milestone for the Blockchain Industry and the FinTech world.\u201d\nDemo Day on September 22 will be co-hosted by Wanxiang Blockchain Labs and ChainB, one of China\u2019s leading blockchain news agencies. New innovations and discoveries will be of particular interest to investors, venture capital firms and start-ups. Nearly one hundred projects have applied to demonstrate their new blockchain inventions in this one-day competition for prizes including 50,000 RMB for \u201cDemo Day Champion\u201d as well as 20,000 RMB for the the most innovative project.\nIn addition, winners company and logo will be featured on ChainB.com, China\u2019s leading blockchain news site.\nAmong the projects are BitSE\u2019s Qtum, a new operating system for blockchain development combined with a modularized basic chain which combines the advantages of numerous public chains like Bitcoin and Ethereum; Digix\u2019s new gold-backed stable coin and the Digix DApp 2.0; Decentralized Capital\u2019s DC assets, a form of digital currency that is secured by the Ethereum network and collateralized by customer deposits, which are for conversions of cash deposits such as dollars and euros; and Trusted Key Solutions Inc with a project that verifies users\u2019 identities once, so they can then reuse their credentials on other apps and sites.\nSurprise Announcements\nIn correspondence with Bitcoin Magazine, Ethereum developer and conference speaker Taylor Gerring said to expect some surprise announcements throughout the week:\n\u201cAs the Ethereum community has grown significantly since last year's Devcon1 in London, a first wave of project announcements are anticipated throughout the week; many of which will serve as core building blocks to further advance the ecosystem. This unique opportunity to exchange ideas across cultural boundaries with the help of sponsors from around the world is the type of massive collaboration needed to advance the blockchain industry beyond this nascent phase.\u201d\nEthereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, will be helping to kick off Devcon on Day 1 with his talk \u201cEthereum in 25 minutes\u201d and will be speaking several times during the event.\n\u201cVitalik's efforts in the past year to grow the global community should be evident at Devcon2. Based on the current attendee roster, the concentration of Ethereum developers and aspiring devs in one place is likely to be unrivaled anywhere,\u201d said Chan.\nChan is also looking forward to hearing from the substantial number of students already registered. \u201cImportantly, there is a larger student contingency, whom we value greatly as they represent the future. There aren't even enough developers to begin to fulfill current needs.\u201d\n\u201cFinally, I dare say the Ethereum platform is moving towards greater reach and adoption sooner than imagined,\u201d she added.\nA recent survey by Greenwich Associates estimates that financial and technology markets investments in blockchain technology will reach $1 billion in 2016. The survey showed that venture capital backed investment in blockchain and bitcoin companies jumped from $3 million in 2011 to $474 million in 2015.\nInternational Blockchain Week will be a celebration of this amazing growth of investment in blockchain technology in the last year.\nMore information about the Summit and a complete speakers list can be found here.", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 7}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nBloq Economist and Bitcoin Hivemind creator Paul Sztorc has been fascinated with prediction markets for many years, and he views these mechanisms for the creation of \u201cevent derivatives\u201d as an essential public good. Although Sztorc had been a supporter of centralized prediction market InTrade in the past, he now sees the need for a blockchain-based solution to allow these sorts of markets to proliferate around the world.\nRecently, Sztorc chatted with Adamant Research Editor in Chief Tuur Demeester about prediction markets, Bitcoin, sidechains and many other topics. During the discussion, Sztorc was able to explain the parallel histories of digital cash systems, such as Bitcoin, and the prediction markets that have fascinated him for all these years.\nThe Days of InTrade\nIn the early days of his interest in Bitcoin, Sztorc was also an avid follower of InTrade, the former online prediction market based out of Ireland. For Sztorc, InTrade was a sign that true, global prediction markets had arrived. \u201cThat was like \u2018where the book club met,\u2019 so to speak,\u201d he told Demeester. \u201cThe institution was sort of there and it was being tried out in various forms, and it wasn\u2019t being pursued very quickly. But at least there was this place where you could go and you could get unbelievably reliable information.\u201d\nTo Sztorc, prediction markets are somewhat magical. He explained:\n\u201cYou\u2019d walk around and hear a bunch of opinions . . . and you wouldn\u2019t know who to believe, but you could just go to this one website that had all the right answers. The answers were always right, and they were right six to eight months in advance.\u201d\nWhen Sztorc talks about the \u201canswers,\u201d he\u2019s talking about the outcomes of future events. Prediction markets have been known to \u201cpredict the future\u201d because those with the knowledge of the inevitable or likely outcome of a future event are incentivized to bet as much as possible on that event via a prediction market.\nAlthough Sztorc was a huge fan of InTrade, it eventually faced legal issues in the United States. Shortly after the 2012 US Presidential Election, InTrade shut down due to \u201cfinancial irregularities.\u201d\nThe Core Similarity Between Digital Cash and Prediction Markets\nWhen asked about the parallels between the histories of digital cash and prediction markets, Sztorc acknowledged that there are a few key similarities. \u201cThe core similarity is that you have a trusted entity that must hold all this money,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just like the [bitcoin] exchanges have money in one fund.\u201d\nThe fact that bitcoin exchanges hold so much bitcoin as one, centralized entity makes them an obvious target for hackers.\nSome say that a centralized prediction market that uses Bitcoin for payments could help combat some of the issues that other prediction market systems have faced in the past. In Sztorc\u2019s view, however, prediction markets would face the same security issues that bitcoin exchanges have seen with that setup.\nIn other words, those centralized prediction markets would eventually be another huge target for hackers, if they were able to gain a large user base. At one point, Demeester referred to InTrade as \u201cthe e-gold of prediction markets,\u201d which is a description Sztorc found to be appropriate.\nE-gold was a digital gold currency that was able to offer mostly uncensored payments for its customers until it was eventually shut down by regulators. In the past, many have made the analogy that e-gold was similar to Napster and Bitcoin is more like Bittorrent. The key difference between Napster and Bittorrent was that Bittorrent removed the central point of failure in file-sharing systems. Sztorc now intends to make the \u201cBittorrent of prediction markets.\u201d\nBitcoin Hivemind\nSztorc\u2019s solution to the problems that prediction markets have faced in the past is Bitcoin Hivemind. The project is intended to be a sidechain to Bitcoin. Backed by angel investor Roger Ver, Bitcoin Hivemind will be a peer-to-peer oracle protocol that allows Bitcoin users to speculate on a decentralized prediction market.\nAn oracle is essentially an entity that that provides real-world data to a computer program. For example, Google Finance is an oracle for stock quotes and ESPN is an oracle for sports scores. In the past, oracles have been centralized. Sztorc\u2019s original Truthcoin white paper outlined the creation of a decentralized oracle made up of many individuals, which is now being implemented in Bitcoin Hivemind.\nWith his project, Sztorc wants to remove the third-party security hole from prediction markets.\nWhile decentralized systems are known to have their efficiency trade-offs when compared to centralized systems, Sztorc noted that a cross-blockchain Lightning Network would allow Bitcoin users to move in and out of positions on a blockchain-based prediction market with relative ease. The Lightning Network allows users to transact in real time through a system of time-locked, multisig transactions. Transactions are signed and passed between parties but not broadcast to the Bitcoin network until settlement is desired.\nTime will tell if InTrade really was the e-gold of prediction markets. If a blockchain is required to allow prediction markets to flourish, Bitcoin Hivemind may be the right solution.", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 12}

The ability to accept bitcoin payments was made possible by the introduction of digital bank WB21, which has integrated BitPay\u00a0as a new payment option.\nBitPay believes their service can significantly reduce the amount of time it takes Straits customers to fund their accounts. \u201cBitPay and WB21 will help customers to easily convert their bitcoin holdings into currencies that can be used to fund their futures trading accounts and will provide the bitcoin community easier access to an alternative suite of investment options,\u201d said Straits Financial President Joseph Mazurek.\nMazurek pointed out that bitcoin cannot currently be used for margin payments of futures contracts, which explains the use of and WB21 to facilitate payments via acceptable currencies.\nThe Advantages of Bitcoin\nWhen asked about the specific benefits of Bitcoin as a payment option for Straits, Mazurek claimed there are distinct advantages with the peer-to-peer digital cash system for the futures industry, especially for non-U.S. customers. \u201cThe funds can be transmitted in any denomination and can be converted to currencies acceptable to futures regulators,\u201d he explained in communication with Bitcoin Magazine.\nMazurek also touched on Bitcoin\u2019s ability to process payments 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. \u201cSince [Bitcoin operates] outside of normal banking hours or holidays, non-U.S. customers can fund their U.S. Futures accounts whenever they wish,\u201d he said.\nBitcoin\u2019s open and permissionless nature is what makes it an added value for Straits Financial.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nCoinpit is taking significant and innovative steps to offer a safer alternative to Bitcoin\u2019s custodial futures exchanges. Thanks to Bitcoin\u2019s multi-signature technology, users that store bitcoins on Coinpit remain in complete control of their funds. Even if the exchange is hacked, goes bankrupt, or disappears completely, customers can in most cases still retrieve their money.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Coinpit Founder and CEO Bharath Rao explained why he believes trustless exchanges are an important next step for the Bitcoin industry.\n\u201cWhy is a bitcoin worth 600 times the world reserve currency? Because there was an unmet hunger for a trustless currency. We want to bring the same properties from the currency layer into financial systems. A financial system with the properties of Bitcoin would eliminate many financial crises,\u201d Rao said.\nCoinpit is no regular exchange, where users exchange bitcoin for fiat currency and back. It\u2019s a bitcoin-futures exchange, where users trade so-called \u201cquanto USD/BTC contracts.\u201d In plain English, this means that Coinpit customers \u201cbet\u201d against each other, allowing them to speculate on bitcoin price movements.\n\u201cThe bitcoin prices we use are derived from the top USD/BTC exchanges,\u201d explained Rao, himself a Wall Street veteran. \u201cAnd our index is arbitrable. This means that with sufficient volume, arbitrage ensures that bitcoin prices on Coinpit and on these exchanges will stay in sync and affect each other. And since one of the effects of offering futures contracts by exchanges has been price stability, Coinpit could realize this for the broader Bitcoin ecosystem as well.\u201d\nFutures exchanges are not new in the Bitcoin world, of course. OKCoin and BitMEX, for example, are popular platforms for such advanced trading strategies. But as last months\u2019 Bitfinex hack reminded the Bitcoin community: exchanges that store customer funds present a single point of failure risk.\nCoinpit is designed to solve this problem.\nWho Has Control?\nCoinpit established a trustless setup with its customers by utilizing Bitcoin\u2019s multisig capabilities. When users fund their Coinpit account, they don\u2019t send their bitcoin to an address solely controlled by Coinpit. Rather, the user and the exchange create a new multisig address that requires two keys to unlock: one generated by the user, and one by Coinpit. With this setup, the bitcoins deposited to the address can only be moved if both the user and Coinpit sign a transaction from the address.\nFurthermore, when Coinpit and the customer sign a transaction, the bitcoins are sent immediately to a Bitcoin address controlled by the customer. The transaction, however, is not broadcast over the Bitcoin network; instead, it is given to the customer to store locally. In the event the site shuts down, the customer can broadcast the transaction to the Bitcoin network at any time and reclaim the funds. The customer is in full control.\nHaving thus funded a trading account, users can jump in to trade at any time. Because Coinpit monitors the Bitcoin network for potential double-spends, the risk of users trying to open a trade while also withdrawing their funds is covered. It\u2019s only when a trade has been opened that bitcoins are sent to a Bitcoin address controlled by Coinpit exclusively. They remain under the exchange\u2019s control as long as the trade is ongoing.\nRao explained:\n\u201cFor now, this is the only way to offer a desirable user experience: latency and fees make on-chain trades impractical. We are looking into making the entire process trustless, however. To achieve this, we may end up creating a derivative trading altcoin that has the required performance and speed characteristics. Or perhaps a Bitcoin sidechain. Or we\u2019ll use the Lightning Network when ready.\u201d\nProtecting Privacy\nCoinpit deals exclusively in bitcoins; no fiat currencies are ever involved. And because the exchange does not offer services to customers in the U.S., Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulation as imposed by the New York BitLicense does not apply. This allows Coinpit to offer significantly more privacy than many other exchange platforms, at least for now.\n\u201cWhen we say we are trustless, it applies to privacy as well,\u201d Rao explained. \u201cOur finding is that privacy breaches result in security breaches and vice versa. To reduce the chances of security and privacy breaches, we try to keep as little information about users as possible.\u201d\nLooking to the future, Rao elaborated:\n\u201cIn due time, if strict cryptocurrency regulation emerges in countries outside of the United States as well, we have the option of going fully decentralized or partnering with regulated exchanges. We are currently exploring both options.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 14}

The Federal Reserve (Fed) has indicated that they are planning to raise interest rates when it meets on September 20\u201321.\nFederal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen suggested that September and December rate hikes are on the table. Some analysts expect the Federal Funds rate to increase by 0.50 percent by year end.\nApart from banks and insurance companies, rising rates are not generally welcomed. Non-financial corporates have gorged on free money to complete stock buybacks and M&A deals. Higher borrowing costs will be disastrous for their highly leveraged balance sheets. That is why equity indices react negatively to any hint that the punch bowl will be removed.\nBitcoin dances to the beat of the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC). The PBOC is staring at a banking system collapse of epic proportions. The amount of credit extended in the past eight years dwarfs the amount extended during the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis by multiples.\nAs long as the Fed keeps rates low, the PBOC is able to quietly and slowly deleverage China\u2019s collective balance sheet. A stronger USD makes Chinese goods more expensive globally. It also encourages more capital flight into a \u201csafer\u201d and stronger currency.\nEach day at 9:15 am Beijing time, the PBOC sets the USD-CNY onshore exchange rate. Since August 2015, any time the Fed has hinted at or raised rates, the PBOC has accelerated the devaluation of the Yuan. A devaluing Yuan signals that the global economy is not well, and deflation is being exported by the workshop of the world. That is not positive. As a result, during periods of Yuan depreciation, global equity markets fall.\nThrough quantitative easing, the Fed attempts to push American savers and corporates into the equity markets. Due to the lack of positive risk-adjusted and inflation-adjusted yielding assets, savers and corporates have responded correctly. The S&P 500 is at all-time nominal highs, and the U.S. equity market is one of the best performing globally since the global financial crisis of 2008.\nGiven that S&P 500 companies earn a significant portion of money internationally, a faltering China signals global malaise. As such, the index trades violently lower. A falling S&P 500 is what the Fed fears most. It forces the same savers and corporates to dump shares in favor of cash. This cash will sit in a bank account, and the demand for credit will fall.\nAfter a sufficient fall in the S&P 500, the Fed typically relents and proclaims due to \u201cmarket forces\u201d the time just isn\u2019t right for a rate hike. The PBOC then halts the devaluation, and the game continues into the next quarter.\nYellen\u2019s Jackson Hole remarks in August were very hawkish. The rhetoric was subsequently backed up by various Fed governors during public speeches. The PBOC noticed and began weakening the Yuan toward 6.70.\nIf the hawkish rhetoric translates into action, the PBOC will allow onshore USD-CNY and offshore USD-CNH to trade much higher (the higher the level, the weaker the Yuan). Bitcoin reacts positively to a weaker Yuan.\nThe market believes that the Fed\u2019s threats to raise rates are credible. Traders are attempting to front run the PBOC using offshore CNH to short the Yuan. In response, the PBOC has instructed state-owned Chinese banks to restrict lending of CNH in order to drive up the cost of funds. Anyone who wants to short CNH will usually borrow it from one of the large Chinese banks. If the interbank CNH rates become prohibitively expensive, shorts are forced to cover.\nWatch USD-CNH: The PBOC has been defending 6.70 in the offshore market. If they allow that level to be breached, it means they are willing to tolerate a much weaker Yuan. Bitcoin will soar.\nThe best hope for a retaking of $700 and then $800 is for the Fed to raise rates next week. However, if the S&P 500 nosedives before the meeting, the Fed will not hike, and then all attention will shift to the December meeting.\nThis guest post will also appear on the BitMEX Blog.

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nSince hardware wallet devices first came to pass in the Bitcoin ecosystem, the Trezor has been the one wallet to rule them all. Added security measures, such as the ability to visually confirm the correct receiving address on the device\u2019s display, were always the key selling point of the Trezor, but Ledger may have now caught up to its rival with the Nano S.\nWhile the Nano S does include a screen for verifying the receiving address before sending a transaction, that\u2019s only part of the reason why it is a compelling alternative to the Trezor. The Nano S also has a lower price point ($65 compared to the $99 Trezor), and Ledger\u2019s open SDK may lead to the development of a large number of new, dynamic applications for the hardware wallet.\nWhile there are plenty of people who have no reason to switch to the Nano S from the Trezor, bitcoin holders purchasing new hardware wallets may find it hard to pass up the latest offering from Ledger.\nThe Use of a Secure Element\nThe level of security provided by the original Ledger Nano was viewed as inferior when compared with the Trezor, but the Nano S appears to have completely flipped the script. The Secure Element included in the Nano S has some members of the Bitcoin community, such as Bitcoin Core contributor Btcdrak and Opendime founder Rodolfo Novak, claiming the Nano S is a more attractive option than the Trezor.\n\u201cApplication isolation and runtime security,\u201d responded Ledger CTO Nicolas Bacca when asked about the advantages of the Secure Element in the Nano S. \u201cOur design is based on a microkernel on top of which applications run. Applications are isolated from each other and from the kernel, which means that, for example, a bug in the Ethereum app cannot compromise Bitcoin-derived keys.\u201d\nAccording to Bacca, the Secure Element also protects against interdiction attacks (when packages are intercepted en route by third parties like the NSA). \u201cThis allows end users to be sure that they are interacting with a genuine device,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is pretty much impossible to do that with a generic [microcontroller] unless you build the device yourself.\u201d\nIn the past, Yubikey manufacturer Yubico has shared similar criticisms of the use of standard microcontrollers in secure hardware devices.\nAccording to Bacca, a Secure Element can also protect against situations where an attacker has physical control over a hardware wallet with some bitcoin on it. Whether a nefarious actor listens to the behavior of the chip in an attempt to deduce information or physically targets specific aspects of the chip to derail running code, a Secure Element has added protections to limit the effectiveness of an attack.\n\u201cIn a complex active attack \u2014 where an attacker tries, for example, to dump the memory by extracting it from the chip \u2014 a Secure Element protects against those by encrypting everything in place (flash, RAM, memory buses) and features a mesh that'll detect potential intrusions into the chip structure and erase its internal cryptographic keys when it happens,\u201d Bacca explained as an example defense mechanism.\nBacca discussed these issues more deeply in a presentation early last year.\nIn general, SatoshiLabs, which is the company behind the Trezor, disagrees with the security claims surrounding the use of a Secure Element. \u201cWe at SatoshiLabs remain skeptical about the use of Secure Elements as a guarantee for security,\u201d SatoshiLabs CEO Alena Vranova told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThe added security may not really be that significant, while the loss of open source might actually pose a serious security threat. Instead of jumping on a promise of smart card security, Trezor has focused on bringing an overall smart security design instead. We chose to use a standard microcontroller, open-sourced our entire stack and implemented PIN and \u00a0passphrase protection as a solid safeguard against physical risk (allowing for plausible deniability).\u201d\nIn response to questions about Secure Elements from Bitcoin Magazine, SatoshiLabs provided a statement that made five key points: closed source is a security threat; the most prevalent threats to a user\u2019s bitcoin stash come from the online world; any wallet will always be susceptible to the $5 wrench attack; there have been successful thefts from chip-and-PIN cards that use Secure Element technology; and the wide use of Secure Elements is making them a larger target for hackers.\n\u201cThe added security may not really be that significant, while the loss of open source might actually pose a serious security threat,\u201d concluded the statement.\nMore Details on the Nano S\nWith the original Nano, the seed for the wallet was generated on the host computer rather than the actual device. This has changed with the Nano S. The seed and PIN are now generated directly on the hardware wallet.\nLedger\u2019s bitcoin wallet software also received the highest score on the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project\u2019s most recent report on bitcoin wallets. Having said that, the wallet only scored a 50 out of 100, and various Bitcoin Core contributors disagreed with certain aspects of the scoring system. Ledger\u2019s Chrome extension was mainly praised for helping users avoid address reuse and allowing multiple accounts to be created and managed.\nAs a comparison, the myTrezor.com web wallet scored a 42 out of 100 in the OBPP report. Having said that, it should be remembered that these hardware devices can be integrated into other, possibly more private bitcoin wallets as well.\nLinux users may still find that their computer does not recognize the Ledger Nano S at first, but the execution of a single command in the terminal resolves this issue quickly.\nLedger Nano S Applications\nIn addition to the improved security features found with the Nano S, Ledger has also created a development environment for applications that could grow rather quickly.\nMuch like the Trezor, the Nano S can be used as a form of second-factor authentication for Google, Dropbox, Dashlane and other accounts. Both hardware wallets use the FIDO U2F open authentication standard, which is said to offer better security than the two-factor authentication people usually use via their smartphones.\nLedger has also developed its own Ethereum wallet, which also supports the Ethereum Classic chain. The Nano S is the first hardware wallet to support either of the Ethereum chains. SatoshiLabs is currently working on getting Trezor integrated into the Mist Ethereum client.\nBoth the Nano S and the Trezor also include support for GPG and SSH.\n\u201cThis is really important,\u201d said Bitcoin Core contributor Nicolas Dorier when asked for his thoughts on the Ledger Blue SDK. \u201cWe are (at\u00a0Metaco, my company) currently working on a product which makes use of this feature for securing hot wallet funds. Other apps will probably come very soon; I'm personally hopeful for OTP and password manager.\u201d\nIt\u2019s already possible to use the Ledger Nano S as a password manager of sorts by linking it to a Dashlane account. SatoshiLabs has also developed a beta version of a password manager specifically for use with the Trezor.\nHow Can Ledger Continue to Improve?\nWhile Ledger has taken a massive step forward with the Nano S, there is still room to improve. One feature that some would like to see added to the Nano S, and which is already included in the Trezor, is multi-passphrase encryption.\n\u201cI'm still not using [the Ledger Nano S] for securing my bitcoin because it lacks an important feature that Trezor has: plausible deniability,\u201d said Dorer. \u201c[The benefits of the Secure Element] are rather useless if you are weak against a $5 wrench attack. I know that they will release [this feature] soon though.\u201d\nIndeed, when asked about this feature, Bacca confirmed that it will be added soon. \u201cWe'll add BIP 39 passphrase support in a future update, mostly for privacy or plausible deniability reasons \u2014 it'll be possible to enter it directly on device or to link it to a specific PIN to work with all services that might not be aware of it,\u201d he said.\nLedger also has a new hardware wallet in the works known as the Ledger Blue, which supports a variety of new features such as Bluetooth connectivity and a touchscreen display. A version of the Ledger Blue for developers and enthusiasts is already available.\nAccording to Dorier, the Secure Element in the Nano S and Ledger\u2019s SDK for developers has raised the standard in the bitcoin hardware wallet industry. He went as far as to say, \u201c[Ledger is] likely the most exciting company in the Bitcoin space right now.\u201d\nDisclosure: In the past, the author of this article has been provided with hardware devices from Ledger and SatoshiLabs at no cost for review purposes.", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 15}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe\u00a0European Banking Authority (EBA) has advised that the\u00a0European Commission\u00a0establish a regulatory regime specific to virtual currencies such as bitcoin. Commenting on the commission\u2019s proposal to amend the existing European anti-money laundering directive, the EBA expresses the opinion that, in the long term, oversight of digital currencies should not fall under regular anti-money laundering provisions, but rather under a specialized EU body.\nIn a\u00a0response to the commission published by the EBA in August 2016, the banking authority suggests that the existing anti-money laundering directive is \u201ccurrently not suitable for mitigating all the risks arising from [virtual currency] transactions. Instead, a separate regulatory regime, or more far-reaching amendments [...] would be required.\u201d\nImpact on Bitcoin Addresses and Miners\nIn July 2016, the European Commission\u00a0published a draft directive, proposing to extend strict anti-money laundering (AML) regulations and \u201ccountering the financing of terrorism\u201d (CFT) measures to Bitcoin service providers. Specifically, the directive would apply to virtual currency exchange services and custodial wallet providers.\nThe draft directive also hinted that further regulation may be required in the future to perhaps include Bitcoin address-ownership. The EBA\u2019s response indicates agreement with that assessment and suggests that mining should be subject to oversight as well, stating:\n\u201c[Virtual currencies] incur additional, technology-specific risks that make them distinct from conventional fiat currencies that are in the scope of [the existing anti-money laundering directive]. So-called \u201851 percent attacks,\u2019 for example, are one such risk, [constituting] a scenario in which a pool of miners attains 51 percent of the computational power with which units of a particular [virtual currency] scheme are mined, which in turn allows that pool to block transactions.\u201d\nThe banking authority therefore says that an amendment to the current anti-money laundering directive may not suffice in the longer term. It argues in favor of the installment of a special regulatory body for virtual currencies in the future.\nEU Directive\nEven though the EBA advises that the commission should establish a regulatory regime specific to virtual currencies, it does generally support the proposed amendment to the existing anti-money laundering directive. As the establishment of a new regulatory regime would take a significant amount of time, the amendment proposal serves as a good intermediary step.\n\u201cSuch a regulatory regime [\u2026] would require several years to develop, consult, finalise and transpose, and is therefore not an option, given the short time frame within which the Commission was asked to develop its proposals,\u201d writes the EBA. \u201cIt may therefore be advisable for the Commission and co-legislators to initiate as soon as possible the comprehensive analysis that is needed for assessing which, if any, regulatory regime would be most suitable for [virtual currency] transactions.\u201d\nThe EBA does, however, suggest that the draft directive requires some refinement. In particular, the banking authority points out that both the European authorities as well as digital currency companies operating in Europe should be well-prepared to deal with new legislation. This might require some additional time before the new directive can applied.\nAccording to the EBA:\n\u201c[I]n order for these amendments to reduce the risk of virtual currencies being abused for money laundering or terrorist financing purposes, the Commission and co-legislators should ensure that competent authorities have the appropriate tools at their disposal to ensure the effective supervision of [custodial wallet providers\u2019] and [virtual currency exchange platforms\u2019] compliance with their AML/CFT obligations.\u201d\nThe new directive is scheduled to be enforced by January 1, 2017, but the EBA believes that June 26, 2017, would be a more realistic goal.\nSharing Data\nThe EBA is also concerned about the international qualities of virtual currencies such as bitcoin.\nAn EU directive is itself not a law, but rather serves as a guideline for individual member states to draft national laws. This means that the resulting laws in any one member state may differ slightly from the others.\nAnd since digital currencies live on the internet, and most service providers \u2014 like digital currency exchanges and custodial wallet providers \u2014 provide their services on the internet as well, state laws are easily circumvented, the EBA warns.\nThe EBA therefore recommends that different European member states will need to work closely together, noting that the risks can be tackled within all of the political union only if the relevant agencies in the different countries cooperate.\nAccording to the EBA:\n\u201cIt is [...] essential that competent authorities from different member states are able to liaise and exchange information in relation to the operation of [virtual currency exchange platforms] and [custodial wallet providers] on their territory. [\u2026] The EBA therefore considers that the EU Commission and co-legislators should therefore introduce further amendments [...] to ensure that competent authorities responsible for the AML/CFT supervision [...] have gateways in place to exchange relevant information with one another.\u201d\nFor specific details and more recommendations by the EBA on the EU directive draft proposal, read the\u00a0full opinion as published by the banking authority.", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 15}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nRoughly two weeks ago, ViaBTC, a relatively new bitcoin mining pool that launched earlier this summer, garnered some attention on social media due to the announcement that they\u2019re currently testing Bitcoin Unlimited, which is a software client that allows users to signal support for hard fork induced changes to Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit.\nAlthough the mining pool was only launched this summer, it has already gained enough hash rate to become the fifth largest pool. Bitcoin Magazine recently reached out to ViaBTC CEO and founder Haiyang to find out more about this relatively unknown player in the bitcoin mining space.\nWho is ViaBTC?\nThe history of ViaBTC has been described in a post on the mining pool\u2019s Medium blog. To summarize, Haiyang left Tencent to start a mining pool and found an investor to help with the project on Chinese-language Bitcoin forum 8btc.\nAccording to Haiyang, ViaBTC\u2019s early investor resources account for a large portion of the mining pool\u2019s hash rate. \u201cViaBTC mining pool had an investor at its early stage, who provided us with the startup capital and hash rate, but didn\u2019t take part in the decision-making and operating of the mining pool,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cCurrently, approximately one third of the hash rate is from our investor, and the rest from our customers.\u201d\nHaiyang added that the mining pool mainly uses the Ant Miner S7, but they also use the Avalon 6, though less frequently.\nSupport for Bigger Blocks\nIn addition to their sizeable share of the network hash rate, ViaBTC has also gained some notoriety due to their stance on the Bitcoin block size debate. On Twitter, the mining pool noted, \u201cWe are No. 5 Bitcoin mining pool, running Bitcoin Core currently, interested in big [blocks].\u201d\nWhile other major mining pools have made an agreement to not run alternative software clients, ViaBTC has no such arrangement. \u201cI have communicated with some [Bitcoin Core contributors], but no formal communication or agreement has been made,\u201d said Haiyang.\nHaiyang also made ViaBTC\u2019s support for an increase in the block size limit very clear. \u201cI support bigger blocks,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, the current 1MB block size restricts the development of Bitcoin. By increasing the block size limit and scaling Bitcoin, Bitcoin itself can be kept simple and pure, and the introduction of excessive complexity can be avoided.\u201d\nIn the past, some have criticized Bitcoin Core contributors\u2019 preference for implementing Segregated Witness via a soft fork due to the perceived complexity involved with the code involved in making these improvements. Various Bitcoin Core contributors have countered this claim by stating protocol changes via hard forks may be more complex due to the need to move users over to a completely separate blockchain.\nCurrently Testing Bitcoin Unlimited\nAlthough ViaBTC would like to see an increase in the block size limit, Haiyang does not see Bitcoin Classic\u2019s BIP 109 implementation as the proper solution. \u201cI think that it\u2019s too shortsighted for Bitcoin Classic to scale the block to 2MB at one time, and it\u2019ll be faced with the current problems in the near future,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need some mechanism to dynamically adjust the block size limit. Hence, in my view, Bitcoin Unlimited\u2019s protocol is more appropriate at the current stage.\u201d\nIn terms of a threshold for activating a hard fork on the Bitcoin network, Haiyang believes something similar to the 75 percent \u00a0activation threshold outlined in BIP 109 would be appropriate. \u201cI agree that 75 percent \u00a0or a slightly higher 80 percent \u00a0is the suitable threshold, since no Bitcoin mining pool has a hash rate proportion of over 20 percent \u00a0at present,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the threshold gets too high, then some Bitcoin mining pool supporting the scaling or not will become a decisive factor; it goes against the idea of Bitcoin decentration. On the other hand, if the threshold gets too low, and no consensus was reached by the majority of people on the Bitcoin network, bifurcation will increase the Bitcoin scaling failure risk.\u201d\nBifurcation is what took place after Ethereum\u2019s recent attempt at hard forking their network. Over 75 percent \u00a0of mining power had signaled at least implicit support of the hard fork before it was activated.\nThe original Ethereum blockchain\u2019s (now called Ethereum Classic) network hashrate is currently roughly 12 percent of the size of the hard-forked Ethereum chain\u2019s hashrate, and the Ethereum Classic market cap is roughly 10 percent the size of the hard-forked chain\u2019s market cap.\nBitcoin Unlimited was recently criticized by Bitcoin Core contributor and Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell. Essentially, Bitcoin Unlimited signals support for BIP 109 by default but does not actually support the full set of rules outlined in the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal. This had the effect of forking Bitcoin Classic nodes off from the testnet.\nBitcoin Unlimited developer Andrew Stone responded to this criticism in a blog post.\n\u201cAbout over a month ago, I did observe the hard fork on the Bitcoin Testnet, but I was busy with other affairs then,\u201d said Haiyang when asked for his thoughts on the incident. \u201cI didn\u2019t investigate the specific causes. It should be irrelevant to the fact that we are testing Bitcoin Unlimited.\u201d\nHaiyang plans to attend the upcoming Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Milan.", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 16}

Through the use of art, though, audiences can better understand the technology and its global impact as it is combined with objects they are familiar with.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Simon said that there are many of interesting cultural and systemic debates focused on the technology.\n\u201cThere seems to be a kind of land grab for the blockchain system that is happening across many spaces in technology and finance,\u201d he said.\nFor somebody interested in culture, now seems to be the right time to make this exciting moment more accessible to people not immediately involved in the world of technology or finance, Denny said.\n\u201cI think that work that is being done by blockchain visionary companies right now has the potential to change some of the most fundamental societal building blocks from which our world is built,\u201d he said. \u201cMoney, sovereignty, trust: These are the things which are potentially at stake here, and are being reimagined by very smart, very active people.\u201d\n\nSimon believes blockchain is the technologist\u2019s solution for creating the building blocks of a more distributed global future as more people become dissatisfied with key institutions such as governance and finance.\n\u201cI want to open up the appeal of something that can seem quite complicated and technical to an outsider and make accessible some of that excitement to a cultural audience,\u201d he said.\nInitially, Simon wasn\u2019t interested in bitcoin; however, it was only last year that he looked more into blockchain after making an exhibition that dealt with the history of hacking and focused on the cyberpunk legacy behind digital currencies.\n\u201cThe idea that it was about automating verification, replacing elite groups and organizations with code, and code as law made me more interested,\u201d he said.\nAs a result, his latest exhibition, Blockchain Future States, focuses on companies that deliver a contrast in their sectors and focus on blockchain. From capital markets and fiat currencies with Digital Asset Holdings, through West Coast technology and Bitcoin with 21 Inc., to a type of international anarchist/engineer and alternative currency with Ethereum, each position helps to establish the possibilities of blockchain technology.\nHowever, while Simon states that while it\u2019s easy coming up with the ideas for his exhibitions, executing them can be a challenge.\n\u201cThere is a balance between staying true to the subject matter [and] giving people a great exhibition experience with textures, colors, forms and information, while keeping in mind attention spans and levels of interest which may not match my own.\u201d\n\nSimon is planning on taking another version of his New York exhibition to Los Angeles in January 2017 at the Hammer Museum.\nAt present, he is working on a new show for Shenzhen, China, that looks at the markets there and how the region has turned into the \u201cSilicon Valley of Hardware\u201d for many people involved in global technology.

For the company, this was their way of saying that they think this ambition is still possible.\n\u201cWe hope its value and the value it returns to the world will continue to grow and we believe firmly that there are no limits to its success,\u201d Streng said.\nWith growing interest in private space programs and the increased possibility of space tourism, Genesis Mining decided to demonstrate how easy bitcoin is to use by sending it into space. Streng adds, however, that sending it to the moon itself is still out of reach for them for the time being.\n\u201cWhile we knew that sending it to the moon may prove difficult in the short term, near space was a pretty great achievement for cryptocurrency so we decided to pursue the project,\u201d he said.\nSurrounded by the lush greenery of the rolling hills and blue skies of Sheffield, England, the team released their weather balloon carrying a 3D printed bitcoin and a Bitcoin wallet. Initially, the goal was to clear 20 km, which is above the Armstrong Limit (the altitude beyond which humans cannot survive without a pressure suit), and send a bitcoin to the wallet.\nIn space, there are many layers. What is known as \u201cnear space\u201d is the region of Earth\u2019s atmosphere that is between 20 and 100 km (65,000 and 328,000 feet) above sea level. The Armstrong Limit is roughly at 20 km, but it extends up to the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n Line, where outer space begins and astrodynamics take over from aerodynamics for flight to be achieved.\nOnce the weather balloon had reached 20 km, the team at Genesis Mining sent one bitcoin to the wallet to make it official, but they wanted to see if they could reach a higher limit.\n\u201cWe hoped to get over 30 km, which we did,\u201d said Streng. \u201cOur partners let us know that 34 km was going to be the optimal height and that is when we sent the second coin.\u201d\nFor the team, sending bitcoin into space helps to increase awareness about \u00a0the digital currency and demonstrate its ease of \u00a0use.\n\u201cWe believe firmly in technology being a vehicle to make our lives better. Showing that Bitcoin can be a part of the growing private space enterprise is another step in that direction,\u201d Streng said.\nWatch the video of the bitcoin launch into near space here:\n", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 20}

While bitcoin may have been the most volatile currency, it has since ceded that mantle to up-and-coming altcoins.\nThe transformation of bitcoin from a volatile experiment, to a \u201cstable\u201d form of electronic money is illustrated in Figure 1. The graph plots the 90-day moving average market capitalization of bitcoin against its 90-day realized volatility.\n\nVolatility peaked alongside the market cap during the 2013 bubble. Over the past three years, the market cap fell substantially, then surpassed the 2013 high earlier this year. During the same period, volatility fell and continued falling.\nThe holy grail for many users is a digital currency that has a growing market cap and falling price volatility. A large market cap helps improve liquidity and reduce transaction costs. Falling volatility means that bitcoin can retain its value for longer periods of time. That helps facilitate its adoption in online commerce and as an asset for savings.\nBitcoin\u2019s march toward reserve status is not welcomed by all. Many speculators, who account for a significant portion of trading volumes, prefer very volatile digital currencies. Short-term trades with high leverage can yield stupendous returns. As bitcoin\u2019s volatility falls, it becomes boring and speculators search for the next hot altcoin.\nThe solution to a boring coin is more leverage. Given the increasing liquidity, leverage offered by trading platforms will increase, and retain the attention of speculators. If the volatility keeps falling, 500x and 1,000x leveraged trading will become increasingly popular.\nRegardless of the form, increased leveraged trading via derivatives bleeds into the spot market. Market makers must buy or sell the underlying asset to remain hedged and earn the bid/ask spread. Increased spot trading volumes help commercial users of bitcoin reduce their transaction costs. More commercial users means greater adoption, and hopefully a higher price.\nThe Next Frontier\n\nEther, the token that rides on the Ethereum blockchain, was a boring altcoin until early 2016. The price spiked over 1,000 percent in a few months. Figure 2 is the ratio between Ether and Bitcoin\u2019s realized 90-day volatility. The ridiculous volatility drove on-exchange trading volumes over that of bitcoin for a short time.\nEther\u2019s market cap surged to a high of US$1 billion in the spring of 2016.The smaller market cap means that it is easier to push the price around. Large whales can cause significant price volatility using relatively little capital. Many think this is counterproductive to a successful currency. But without greedy and impatient speculators, where will the liquidity come from?\n\nMonero\u2019s impressive rise from obscurity has captivated traders over the past month. Figure 3 represents the seven-day realized volatility of Monero. At times, Monero has become the most traded product on the BitMEX exchange. Traders are flocking to the Monero futures contract because the price can move by percentage points in a few minutes. With 10x leverage, you can double your stack quite quickly.\nBitcoin illustrates that for any coin to be successful, speculators must be attracted first by high volatility. The coin may be illiquid, but that is exactly what produces the wild price swings that will keep traders captivated. Volatility is the best form of advertising. A coin that is not volatile has either died, or is on the path to reserve status like bitcoin.\nIt is telling that the most liquid pair for any altcoin is its exchange rate vs. bitcoin. At the end of the day, speculators want their profits denominated in the world\u2019s most \u201cstable\u201d digital currency.\nData Sources:\nFigure 1, Quandl\nFigure 2, ETH BitMEX and Bitcoin Quandl\nFigure 3, BitMEX\nThis op-ed is a guest post by Arthur Hayes.

{"title": "Op-Ed: What Is the True Meaning of \"Decentralization\" in Blockchain Technology?", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/guest-post-what-is-the-true-meaning-of-decentralization-in-blockchain-technology-1474558340/", "birthday": "Sep 22, 2016  11:32 AM EST", "date": "2016-09-22 16:32:00", "content": "Recent years have brought significant misunderstanding of the term decentralization as it pertains to Bitcoin. Literally, it means the dispersal of nodes, data, miners and developers; according to some, the dispersal of miners (everyone mining with a consumer PC) is the original vision of Satoshi, and that vision supports One CPU/One Vote, meaning every single user mines with a home PC and a smartphone. People who modified algorithms to antagonize the R&D of AISC chips were hoping to avoid the centralization of computation power that these chips would bring. Inevitably these efforts were in vain: algorithms could stall the birth of specialized mining chips, but not prevent it.\nThe truth is, everyone-mines-with-PC \u2014 the One IP/One Vote ideology \u2014 is exactly what Satoshi opposes. If every miner\u2019s PC were to contribute as a full node, all the IP addresses of all of the nodes will be empowered equally. As a result, those who have the power to distribute a large sum of IP addresses, say a botnet, could dominate the Bitcoin network. A botnet could comprise hundreds of thousands of nodes; e.g. the Baofeng Trojan Horse controls 250,000 nodes, much more than Bitcoin\u2019s 6,000 to 8,000 full nodes. The botnet controlled by the Baofeng Trojan Horse could then easily launch 51 percent attacks.\nInstead, what Satoshi really meant with \u201cOne CPU/One Vote\u201d is that one computational unit represents one unit of power. More computational units equals more power: This is represented by Computation is Power in the proof-of-work (PoW) system.\nIt sounds like a truly fair and decentralized utopia if everyone gets to mine with PCs and smartphones. But why is the stability of a blockchain compromised in this context? Simple, decentralization is not a term describing a status, but a process in aggregate. Decentralization of status does not necessarily mean the decentralization of the process.\nNodes are dispersed in a botnet in terms of the status, but they are highly identical in terms of behavioral patterns. In contrast, true decentralization is measured by the degree of freedom allowed for joining in the consensus-making. Given that the codes are open source and that this information is equally accessible, freedom of decision-making is an indication of fairness. One enjoys the power to participate, as well as the power to quit.\nAnother way to understand decentralization is to think of it like an investment portfolio. A portfolio demands the diversification of risks and assets. This is a viewpoint that dates back hundreds of years. In the words of Antonio in Shakespeare\u2019s \u00a0The Merchant of Venice:\nMy ventures are not in one bottom trusted,Nor to one place; nor is my whole estateUpon the fortune of this present year\nAs the common saying goes, don\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket.\nHowever, if the assets in one basket are related, a diversification of the portfolio, no matter to what degree, will not diversify the risks. In a downward market, a portfolio of related assets could lead to a loss. In such a situation, a long shot like allocating all capital to one item could be a better choice.\nShould the degree of the relationship among these assets be unknown, then the Principle of Maximum Entropy may apply: assume these assets are of a maximum randomness. For a blockchain, assume the nodes enjoy absolute freedom of decision-making and are not entrusting developers with disproportionate power and also delegating them to do the bookkeeping.\nPrinceton University\u2019s open course in Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies suggests Bitcoin\u2019s consensus algorithm is highly dependent on randomness. Instead of setting specific timing for the process of consensus making, it posits that, over time, the probability of some blocks achieving consensus recognition will increase, while the probability of conflicting viewpoints emerging will decrease exponentially.\nThe everyone-mines-with-PC model may appear to be more dispersed. However, should these PCs get infected with a bot virus, their behavior will be affected as one. No matter how great the number of nodes, they actually can be seen as just one node.\nAnother example would be the use of multi-sig security by the Bitfinex exchange. Because the private key kept by BitGo automatically signs for all requests from the Bitfinex server, this 2-key system is a de facto 1-key system. No matter how many private keys are used in a multi-sig system, or how dispersed they are, as long as the behavioral pattern of these keys is identical, this multi-sig system is compromised.\nBy contrast, though the PoW incentive causes the appearance of centralization of computational power (in fact it\u2019s dispersed, although a few hands control the greatest amount of computational power), nobody could stop you from joining in the mining or the R&D of mining devices. It\u2019s a decentralized process of free competition. It\u2019s like voting in an election: While a democracy could produce a Canadian prime minister like Justin Trudeau (son of former prime minister, Pierre Trudeau) thereby creating a blood succession in appearance, the decentralization of the democratic process empowers its legitimacy.\nDecentralization is not a new word. Think of the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d of Adam Smith; It\u2019s competition in a free market. With competition, the centralization of computational power is not a bad thing. On the one hand, the high cost of computation makes it impossible for pools and miners to launch 51 percent attacks as they are rational economic participants. On the other hand, irrational actors, say a pool with a large portion of computational power, cannot sustain an attack. The computational powers of a pool do not truly belong to it, and it will face constant challenges from new powers and new players.\nThe centralization of computational power is the natural result of market competition. Specialized labor is the natural result of free competition in any open system, pretty much like a biological organism. Professional miners, professional payment processors and wallets, professional blockchain data providers: These are the natural results of the decentralization of a blockchain, not the consequence that should be deliberately avoided.\nThis op-ed is a guest post by Chang Jia.

The two partners anticipate completing all the relevant milestones by October 2016 and will eventually move forward to a pilot phase right after the trial, Gangesh Ganesan, CTO and co-founder of PeerNova told Bitcoin Magazine.\nThe trial program uses PeerNova's technology Cuneiform, a big data platform designed to support the speed and scale required by large financial institutions, while incorporating key characteristics of blockchain technology including immutability, verifiability and security.\nThe trial aims at assessing the potential of blockchain technology to track the lineage of capital with greater certainty than traditional infrastructures.\nCustodial banks manage trillions of dollars of invested capital on behalf of their clients. These include asset managers, asset owners, insurers, official institutions, hedge funds and private equity funds. The new platform could provide State Street's clients with more transparent, timely and auditable reporting methods.\nHu Liang, senior vice president of the Emerging Technologies Center at State Street,\u00a0said in a media release that tracking the flow of investment capital was critical for fund managers, particularly to calculate the performance of their investments.\nHe noted that if the trial proves to be a success, the potential to provide this higher degree of precision and verifiability would bring \"meaningful value\u201d to thei clients.\nState Street, a leading provider of financial services, started actively exploring blockchain in late 2015 when it\u00a0joined R3's blockchain consortium and separately launched a number of experiments with blockchain, according to a\u00a0report by the Wall Street Journal.\nLiang said at that time that blockchain technology could be a real game changer, substantially transforming how financial transactions are recorded, reconciled and reported \u2014 all with additional security, lower error rates and significant cost reductions.\nA report by Santander InnoVentures\u00a0claims that blockchain technology could help banks save between US$15-20 billion per annum in infrastructure costs.\nWhile blockchain technology may hold great promise for the financial services industry, there are still a number of challenges to overcome before reaching widespread adoption. A report by the World Economic Forum released in August suggests that updating financial infrastructure through distributed ledger technology will require a significant amount of resources, as well as deep collaboration between incumbents, innovators and regulators.\n\u201cMost blockchain initiatives that we have heard of involve changing all existing approaches \u2014 changing the infrastructure, workflows, platform, protocols, etc.,\u201d said Ganesan.\n\u201cIn large financial institutions, it\u2019s very difficult \u2014 sometimes impossible \u2014 to make such wholesale changes. Hence, blockchain adoption in mission-critical applications has been slow. PeerNova\u2019s approach has been to figure out how to ensure that our platform can co-exist with legacy systems, applications, workflows, etc. and yet offer significant benefits, even in such mission-critical applications.\u201d\nBesides State Street, Ganesan said that the company has had similar engagements with several other financial institutions. \u201cAll of them are based on distributed ledger applications using our Cuneiform platform,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be announcing more partnerships in the coming weeks, months.\u201d\nPeerNova is a Silicon Valley-based technology company founded by veteran entrepreneurs. Its executive team consists of members with past experience at Intel,\u00a0Qualcomm, Visa and IBM. The company has raised US$19.59 million in funding so far, with participation from Mosaik Partners, Overstock.com, Steve Case, Dr. Azhar Aziz (the founder and CTO of FireEye), and other prominent investors.\nPeerNova specializes in blockchain systems for large-scale commercial applications.

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nTwo attempts to increase Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit via hard forks \u2014 Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic \u2014 have failed to gain much support in terms of network hashrate, but early bitcoin advocate and angel investor Roger Ver is not giving up on the cause. Ver is currently testing a new mining pool at Bitcoin.com, and he\u2019s put together a new development team to work on an alternative to Bitcoin Core, the reference implementation of the Bitcoin protocol.\nBitcoin Magazine recently reached out to Ver to get more details on his plan to increase the block size limit by way of a hard fork.\nA Work-in-Progress\nAccording to Ver, his plan for hard forking Bitcoin is still a work-in-progress. \u201cI still have lots more research and thinking to do,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThe first step is to actually have our pool up and running. I think you will see our first block mined on the network this coming week.\u201d\nThe Bitcoin.com mining pool mined its first block a few days after Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Ver.\nThe current mining pool software is running Bitcoin Unlimited, but Ver says a specific plan for increasing the Bitcoin block size has not been chosen at this time. With Bitcoin Unlimited, nodes are able to choose the maximum size of the blocks they create and accept as valid. According to one Bitcoin.com mining pool developer, the pool will mine 1 megabyte blocks and accept blocks as large as 16 megabytes for now.\nWhen \u00a0asked about an activation threshold for a hard fork, Ver seemed to distance himself from the idea of increasing the block size limit without a large amount of support signaled by miners on the network. \u201cUltimately the threshold is always 51 percent, but we would also likely support something higher in order to try to maintain more cohesiveness with the community,\u201d he said.\nVer is unable to publicly disclose the members of his alternative Bitcoin development team at this time, although he recently stated during an episode of The Bitcoin Game that former Bitcoin Core lead maintainer Gavin Andresen is not on the team.\nIn terms of how much hashing power the pool will have on mainnet, Ver told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cWe will start off with a very small amount on mainnet to test for a few blocks, and then grow quickly from there.\u201d\nBitcoin Unlimited Forks Classic Off Testnet\nAlthough the Bitcoin.com mining pool only recently went live on the mainnet, the pool has been operating on testnet for over a month. In fact, the Bitcoin.com mining pool forked Bitcoin Classic off of the testnet because Bitcoin Unlimited signals support for BIP 109 without actually implementing the full set of rules in that specific proposal.\n\u201cI would recommend reading the discussions that already took place on /r/btc about this,\u201d said Ver when asked about this incident.\nWhen Bitcoin Core contributor and Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell challenged Ver regarding the testnet fork and the \u201cconsensus inconsistencies between Bitcoin \u2018Classic\u2019 and other implementations are now causing Classic to reject the testnet chain with most work,\u201d Ver pointed out, \u201cWe are testing on testnet. That\u2019s what testnet is for.\u201d\nBitcoin Unlimited has been promoted as production-ready software for at least half a year, which is one of the reasons why some Bitcoin Core contributors have been seeking further clarification on exactly what was being tested with Ver\u2019s testnet mining pool.\n\u201c[Bitcoin Unlimited] and [Bitcoin] Classic both claim to support the same consensus rules (BIP109), but are diverged and will not share the same testnet anymore \u2014 the whole point of a consensus system is to come to consensus and [Bitcoin Unlimited] and [Bitcoin] Classic will reliably fail to do so on testnet,\u201d commented Maxwell.\nBitcoin Unlimited developer Andrew Stone shared his views on the testnet fork in a blog post. \u201cBitcoin Unlimited's \u2018excessive block\u2019 and \u2018excessive accept depth\u2019 algorithm is not just an arbitrary choice \u2014 it\u2019s the optimal choice rational software can make in an untrusted network,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn essence, it encourages the client's preferences to the extent that the client can do so, but then follows the majority when the client's preference is rejected.\u201d\nScaling Bitcoin to Meet Customer Demand\nIn Ver\u2019s opinion, the current 1 megabyte block size limit is preventing further adoption of Bitcoin as a digital cash system. \u201cAs someone who has 15 years of experience scaling enterprise networks before my involvement in Bitcoin, there is no doubt in my mind that the network can handle significantly larger than 2 megabytes blocks today,\u201d he stated.\nIn fact, in the aforementioned interview on The Bitcoin Game, Ver claimed a block size limit of 20, 30, 40, or even 50 megabytes may be fine. A key clarification on this statement is that Ver does not believe excess block size would be used right away. \u201cIf the maximum block size today was set at 50 megabytes, the blocks wouldn\u2019t be 50 megabytes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe blocks would probably be about a megabyte-and-a-half \u2014 maybe two megabytes.\u201d\nIn his comments to Bitcoin Magazine, Ver took this point further. \u201cIf there was no limit on the block size at all today, most blocks would likely be somewhere between 1.2 megabytes and 3 megabytes at the moment.\u201d\nIn the past, Bitcoin Core contributors, such as Blockstream\u2019s Mark Friedenbach, have argued that miners with better connections have an incentive to create bigger blocks. A miner could potentially stuff blocks full of transactions in order to gain a competitive advantage over their peers.\nThe key for Ver is to allow Bitcoin to scale in tandem with customer demand. He does not want to see potential users move away from Bitcoin due to its \u201clack of scalability today.\u201d\n\u201cSadly this is already happening on a large scale,\u201d said Ver. \u201cBut the current [Bitcoin Core] development team doesn\u2019t seem to realize this or care. Some of them were even openly advocating that people use credit cards instead of Bitcoin at a local Silicon Valley Meetup earlier this year.\u201d\n\u201cI feel disturbed that some would consider it traitorous to mention that there exist systems other than Bitcoin that solve problems that Bitcoin doesn't,\u201d said LedgerX Bitcoin developer and Bitcoin Core contributor Bryan Bishop when asked to comment on Ver\u2019s reaction to the views expressed at Silicon Valley Meetup.\nTo some, the idea of using a decentralized system, such as Bitcoin, to buy a morning coffee at Starbucks doesn\u2019t make much sense. There are tradeoffs when switching between centralized payment providers, such as Visa or Mastercard, and Bitcoin, and it\u2019s unclear if there is much point to paying for a morning coffee on a system where the main value proposition is censorship resistance.\nIn 2013, there was a belief in the Bitcoin community that the average person would soon make all of their purchases via the peer-to-peer digital cash system, but the reality is \u2014 at least up to this point \u2014 that normal people don\u2019t seem to have any desire to use Bitcoin for everyday purchases. Last year, Blockchain Capital Managing Partner Brock Pierce noted consumer adoption of Bitcoin could be a five\u2013 to twenty-year process.\nDue to the 10-minute confirmation time associated with Bitcoin blocks, some say that the peer-to-peer digital cash system is not suitable for purchases at brick-and-mortar stores. The Bitcoin Core scaling roadmap includes layer-2 solutions, such as the Lightning Network, which allow for essentially instant confirmations at little to no cost. Others see zero-confirmation transactions as useful for physical retail stores, but these unconfirmed transactions also come with risks.\nThere are potential risks with the Lightning Network as well, but these risks can be mitigated via Maxwell\u2019s timestop proposal, which is outlined in an updated version of the Lightning Network white paper.\nIn his final remarks, Ver made his long-term goals for bitcoin clear. \u201cI\u2019m interested in building a currency to rival the Dollar, the Euro, and the Yen,\u201d he said. \u201cBitcoin will need to scale via many different ways in order to accomplish that.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 22}

Later, miners had to switch to GPUs, then to ASICs and then to more and more sophisticated bitcoin mining equipment. Today, most mining is done in specialized mining farms, operated by a few large players that invest substantial money in hardware facilities located in places with low temperatures and low electricity costs. It would seem that the era of private mining is over and the trend toward professional mining is here to stay.\nEarly next week, however, Bitmain will launch the latest addition to its bitcoin mining product line, the Antminer R4, designed to address some of the hurdles that have kept home miners on the sidelines.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the advent of professional mining was foreseen by Satoshi Nakamoto himself in 2010. \u201cThe current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale,\u201d said Nakamoto. \u201cThat would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server. The design supports letting users just be users. The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be. Those few nodes will be big server farms. The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don\u2019t generate.\u201d\nIt appears that Nakamoto was right. However, it\u2019s important to remember that, besides generating cash from electric power, which is the objective of miners, distributed mining validates bitcoin transactions and maintains the blockchain. The distributed maintenance of the blockchain, crowdsourced with financial incentives, is what gives power and resiliency to the Bitcoin network. If, on the contrary, only a few large operators maintain the blockchain, then the network becomes de-facto centralized, and its stability is threatened by 51 percent attacks.\nTherefore, bringing Bitcoin mining back to small miners at home seems to be a very good idea. It is, after all, still possible to mine at a profit, and those who invest in modern mining equipment can still recover their investment and make some extra money. However, modern mining rigs generate a lot of heat and make a lot of noise, which reduces the appeal of home mining.\nEnter Bitmain, the producer of Antminer. Headquartered in Beijing, with offices in Shenzhen, Chengdu, Qingdao, Hong Kong, Tel Aviv, and Amsterdam, Bitmain also develops the cloud mining platform, Hashnest and operates the mining pool Antpool.\nEarly next week, Bitmain will launch the latest addition to its bitcoin mining product line, the Antminer R4. According to the company, the Antminer R4 will be the world\u2019s most silent multi-terahash bitcoin miner. Bitmain is also launching a silent 2600W Power Supply Unit (PSU), the APW5, specially designed for high-performance mining.\nThe Antminer R4 uses the power-efficient 16nm BM1387 ASIC chip for bitcoin mining. It can deliver a hashrate of 8.6TH/s with a power efficiency of 0.1J/GH at a noise level lower than 50dB. At an ambient temperature of 35\u00b0C, the R4\u2019s noise level is 52dB. The BM1387 chip is built using TSMC's 16nm FinFET technology and delivers 0.098 J/GHs, which according to Bitmain makes it the world's most efficient bitcoin mining chip in the consumer market. Each Antminer R4 employs 126 BM1387 chips.\n\u201cThe Antminer R4 has been designed with great care to ensure the least possible sound with the maximum hashrate,\u201d notes the Bitmain press release. \u201cIt replaces the traditional miner fan with a rotary blade system inspired by the fan of a silent split air conditioner. The speed of this unique fan is automatically controlled to ensure that it never produces more sound than is absolutely necessary. The slim design of the Antminer R4 allows it to be conveniently placed in a book rack or on a computer table at home.\u201d\nFor home users who wish to utilize the Antminer R4 with the optimum performance, Bitmain highly recommends that they use it with the APW5 power supply.\nThe APW5 is Bitmain\u2019s most advanced PSU to date and is compatible with both the 220V power supply and the 110V power supply that is the standard in North America. With a 220V supply, it can deliver an output of 2600W. The APW5 combines high efficiency and good dynamic performance into a power dense package and also features overload, overheat, overcurrent and low voltage protection. The PSU is built for high-power performance and low noise. Like that of the R4, the APW5\u2019s fan is automatically controlled so it only produces as much sound as is absolutely necessary.\n\u201cWith the release of these products, Bitmain hopes to bring bitcoin mining back to homes and continue decentralizing the bitcoin mining network,\u201d notes the Bitmain press release. With convenient high-performance mining rigs, Bitmain hopes that home miners will be better able to continue to play an essential role in the Bitcoin network.", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 26}

First, roughly 4.1 million ETC will be made available for withdrawal this morning, August 30, \u00a0from the so-called \u201cWhite Hat DAO,\u201d which is a child DAO created by a group of individuals working to protect DAO token holders from bad code that allowed an attacker to partially drain The DAO of its ETH (and now ETC) holdings. The DAO token holders who receive these funds will be able to sell the ETC for ETH or any other asset on the open market for the first time since the Ethereum hard fork. The process of allowing DAO token holders to withdraw their ETC has been taken over by Switzerland-based digital currency exchange Bity.\nIn addition to the White Hat DAO withdrawals, the attacker who originally drained The DAO of some of its ether holdings will also finally be in full control of those funds on the ETC chain on September 2nd. According to Bity Legal Manager, Alexis Roussel, the attacker has access to one child DAO, which holds roughly 5 percent of all ETC in circulation.\nProblems With the White Hat DAO\nAlthough DAO token holders will soon have access to some of their ETC holdings, the White Hat Group originally had control of about 7.2 million ETC. The plan was to convert the salvaged ETC to ETH in order to do what the White Hat Group thought was in the best interest of DAO token holders. Articulated reasons for taking this course of action included threat of replay attacks on the ETH chain, a lack of block explorers and other necessary tools on the ETC chain and potential hashpower or speculator-based attacks on the ETC chain.\nSome have argued that this attempt to convert the White Hat DAO\u2019s ETC to ETH amounts to an attack on ETC.\nRoughly 14 percent of the ETC controlled by the White Hat Group has been converted to ETH and other currencies, but Poloniex and Kraken froze the White Hat Group\u2019s accounts before allowing them to continue with their plan. Representatives from Bity have reached out to Kraken and Poloniex on multiple occasions, but the exchanges have not responded with any sort of reasoning as to why the accounts have been frozen.\nRoussel added that Bity is a regular user of Kraken and they have always responded to their inquiries in the past. An email from Bitcoin Magazine to Kraken CEO Jesse Powell was not returned, but Powell recently commented on the matter via Reddit. His comments appear to indicate that an investigation into the White Hat Group\u2019s actions may be the reasoning behind the freezing of the accounts.\n\u201cUnfortunately, we're not the only ones who thought the bizarre actions of the \u2018white hat\u2019 group warranted additional scrutiny,\u201d said\u00a0Powell. \u201cWe're presently seeking approval from other interested parties to let the funds go out to the withdraw contract.\n\u201cWhen we can't say what's going on, you can probably guess what's going on,\u201d continued Powell in another comment. \u201cI wish I could say more. It's our goal to get the coins back to their rightful owners. [The White Hat Group's] earlier antics drew a lot of attention that has substantially complicated the matter.\u201d\nAt this point, 28 percent of the White Hat DAO\u2019s funds are held by Poloniex and 16 percent are held by Kraken.\nThe Effect on the ETC Price\nWhen the initially available White Hat DAO funds are combined with The DAO attacker\u2019s holdings, the result is that nearly 10 percent of the entire ETC supply is going to be able to be sold for the first time by September 2nd. This could potentially have a significant and negative impact on the ETC price and market cap. \u201cI cannot speculate as to what the DAO attacker will do, but supply and demand calls for a price drop,\u201d Brave New Coin Head of Research, Tone Vays, told Bitcoin Magazine.\nWhen asked for his opinion on what DAO token holders will do when they gain access to their ETC for the first time, Roussel told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cI have no clue.\u201d\n\u201cThe market is a mechanism to allocate scarce resources in the most efficient way,\u201d said Ethereum Classic Project spokesperson, Arvicco. \u201cIf there is indeed \u2018a massive dump\u2019 as many people fear (or hope), it will just serve to re-allocate the ETC from people who do not understand Ethereum Classic\u2019s value proposition to those who do. Just as a much much bigger initial dump of ETC tokens upon introduction of exchange trading did.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a lot of potential for a massive dump.\u201d Arvicco added.\nThe ETC price has been on a steady decline throughout the month of August.\nThank you to Bity Legal Manager Alexis Roussel for his assistance with this article.\nImage by Anthony via Flickr", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 30}

Unlike Bitcoin, Zcash transactions automatically hide the sender, recipient and value of all transactions on the blockchain. Only those with the correct view key can see the contents. Users have complete control and can opt-in to provide others with their view key at their discretion.\nNow the Zcash team has announced that the time to release their code and launch the genesis block of the Zcash blockchain is getting close. \u201cWhen the Zcash genesis block is launched, anyone in the world will be able to mine Zcash and users will be able to send it to anyone in the world with the advantage of full zero-knowledge privacy,\u201d states the announcement. \u201cOur aim in creating the Zcash blockchain is to launch the first open, permissionless financial system with zero-knowledge privacy and best achievable security.\u201d\nThe launch target date for the Zcash blockchain is set for October 28, 2016. In the meantime, the team is busy with a technical audit, carried out with the help of external audit firms and hackers, to review its code and correct vulnerabilities.\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Zooko Wilcox, Zcash founder and CEO, to find out more.\nZooko explained that the audit process is ongoing. \u201cThe external security consultants we're working with are real pros and we're already glad that we are doing this with them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're diagnosing and (in some cases) fixing issues as we go. We'll publish complete reports about everything that the auditors found and how we responded to each issue. We've already spent tens of thousands of dollars on it and before the process is through, the cost may reach 6 figures. This is one of the many reasons why we needed to have funding to create Zcash.\u201d In a more recent update, Zooko has since confirmed that Zcash has already spent 6 figures on the security audits.\n\u201cFrankly, the results so far have left me uneasy about the security of Zcash,\u201d admits Zooko. \u201cThe auditors haven't yet found any critical bugs that would allow a really harmful attack like remote theft of Zcash, but they have found bugs which could result in lesser damage (like denial-of-service), and many bugs which might be harmless or \u2018might\u2019 be vulnerable to exploitation and it's hard to tell which. The number of bugs we've found so far makes me think that there are more bugs left in the code that we haven't yet found. It's possible Zcash will follow the example of Bitcoin, where critical bugs were found and fixed in the software even after there was a live blockchain and real money depending on it. This is one of the reasons why nobody should risk more money on Zcash than they can afford to lose.\u201d\nThe first version that Zcash is releasing on October 28, 2016 is just a daemon and command-line tool that only runs on Linux. \u201cThat means there is no GUI at all, so you can't use it at all if you're not a Linux-wielding power user and it doesn't run at all on Mac or Windows,\u201d explains Zooko.\nZooko hopes that that the makers of wallet software for Bitcoin and Ethereum will add Zcash support to their wallets and that they will do it faster and better than the Zcash team could. \u201cAfter all, we're not GUI experts!\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cOur team has a world-class collection of skills in cryptography, infosec, cryptocurrencies, networking and distributed systems and so on, but GUI design and implementation is something we're lacking. I know that some of those wallet makers are already working on this. So, write to your favorite wallet maker today and ask them to add Zcash support!\u201d\nSimilarly, the Zcash team doesn\u2019t intend to provide a Zcash exchange for bitcoin and fiat. Some of the existing cryptocurrency exchanges around the world are adding Zcash support, but Zooko isn\u2019t at liberty to disclose which ones yet. \u201cWrite to your favorite one and request it,\u201d is Zooko\u2019s advice.\nOn Mining Zcash\nHow hard Zcash mining will be and whether it could be (at least initially) feasible for PC users without expensive extra hardware, can\u2019t be known at this moment. \u201cOur intent was to make Zcash mining feasible on commodity hardware, like your laptop when you aren't using it overnight,\u201d explains Zooko. \u201cSee this post for our reasons for choosing this Proof-of-Work algorithm. However, it is not yet clear to what degree we've succeeded at that, or whether custom mining implementations and large-scale mining operations will be more cost-efficient.\u201d\n\u201cOne of the external security auditors that we've hired \u2014 Solar Designer \u2014 is tasked with studying our Proof-of-Work algorithm and writing a report about this. We'll publish his report in full, just like the others.\n\"I really hope that people run Zcash miners on their laptops and servers anyway, even if it isn't profitable, because it is a public service; it supports the decentralized network that provides a private, censorship-resistant, permissionless blockchain to everyone on the Internet.\u201cEven if this Proof-of-Work algorithm doesn't close the gap between your commodity laptop and a customized, large-scale mining operation, we've definitely succeeded at \u2018narrowing\u2019 the gap, so it is possible that a lot of volunteers running a miner on their commodity hardware will make it unprofitable to invest in building large-scale Zcash mining operations.\u201cIf this approach doesn't work out and customized and scaled-up mining operations do come to dominate, that isn't the end of the world. Then we'll be in the same boat as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which isn't so bad.\u201dAccording to Zooko, as Zcash was\u00a0designing its mining algorithm, he was starting to think that there\u00a0might need to be\u00a0some kind of \"fundamental trade-off\" between decentralization and resistance to 51 percent attacks.\u201cWith a wide variety of amateur miners using the idle resources of their commodity hardware (like Bitcoin in the early days), the blockchain is more vulnerable to 51% attack, but it is highly decentralized. With a small number of professional miners with specialized mining operations (like Bitcoin today), it is less decentralized, but it is stronger against 51% attack. (Because of the greater scale and because the miners have a capital investment tied to the value of the coin, which incentivizes them to protect the value of the coin.)\u201cWe decided to aim for decentralization instead of aiming for 51%-attack-resistance, but if we miss decentralization and we hit 51%-attack-resistance, that's not too bad!\u201d\nEnhancing Privacy in Digital Currency\nZooko explained that he doesn\u2019t consider privacy as a property of a single transaction, but rather as an emergent property from a sequence of transactions among a group of people. \u201cIt's sort of an inherently social construct in that way; privacy is something you can only get in groups,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you buy some Zcash with bitcoin, everyone will be able to see \u2014 on the Bitcoin blockchain \u2014 to what Bitcoin address you sent your bitcoin (for example, to the address of an exchange that will allow you to trade bitcoin for Zcash). If you then spend your Zcash on something private (say, paying your employees's salaries, or buying psychiatric treatment) using a Zcash private transaction, nobody will be able to see, just by looking at the Zcash blockchain, what you spent it on.\u201d\nZooko is persuaded that a Zcash economy could emerge in the long term. \u201cThe dream is that people all around the world use Zcash and other cryptocurrencies directly, to cooperate and organize with one another in safety and privacy,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThis will give them freedom from corrupt regimes, banks and unstable national currencies.\u201dZooko imagines that this is a long-term type of dream that will come true in time. \u201cWhen it does start happening, it could happen fast, but it might be years or decades before it begins. It might even turn out that the tipping point for this new way of cooperating and organizing won't be the cash-like functionality that we currently emphasize, but instead, new features like custom tokens, multisig, Distributed Autonomous Organizations and other sorts of \u2018smart contracts\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cEventually I imagine these sorts of technologies will become part of the fabric of our society, like the Internet has become during my lifetime.\u201d\nZooko strongly objected to the suggestion of \u201cthe inevitable use of Zcash to buy child porn or fund the ISIS.\u201d This is what he said:\n\u201cI don't even think it is a valid question. It's kind of a \u2018have you stopped beating your wife?\u2019 question. I don't think it is \u2018inevitable\u2019 that child pornographers and ISIS will use Zcash. ISIS is currently working on deploying 8th century technology. If they ever start to use blockchain technology like Bitcoin and Zcash, it will be because it has become part of the fabric of our society, like the Internet, so that bad guys (along with everyone else) can hardly not use it.\u201d\nContinuing the Unfinished Revolution\nZooko added that he remembers when the Internet was new and there was a lot of hand-wringing about how it might be used for crime. \u201cI think that story faded away approximately when the first generation of digital natives started reading news,\u201d he said. \u201cYounger people today don't appear to know that there was a time when the Internet was a scary new technology that should be regulated or banned in order to prevent crime.\u201d\n\u201cWe first wanted to push outward the boundaries of human knowledge by scientific exploration,\u201d concludes Zooko. \u201cNow these scientific discoveries (by us and many, many others) look like they can radically empower people \u2014 individuals, small groups, and also giant organizations like corporations and governments.\u201cThe Internet is an unfinished revolution. I remember what the world was like before the Internet. You didn't talk to people from other countries! National boundaries were communication boundaries. And you couldn't talk to or share information with almost all of the people in your own country, either. You were dependent on a small number of personal acquaintances and information gatekeepers.\u201cThe Internet changed all that, and it changed the world, and it changed all of our lives for the better. The myriad ways that the Internet has remade and improved our lives is impossible to even measure.\u201cBut it is an unfinished revolution, because although it allows you to share information with potentially billions of people, it doesn't provide a way for you to organize with them. You can't cooperate with them to allocate resources. You can't pool your resources with them, you can't help them pay their bills or make sure they get food, such as by hiring them, buying something from them, or donating to them. And they can't do that for you. You can't enter into an enforceable agreement (a contract) with a group of people, unless your group fits into a product from the small number of gatekeepers that control such possibilities.\u201cWhat is our role in history? I want to be able to look back and say that we played even a small part in reigniting the unfinished revolution. I want to be able to say we were there, pushing for that great transformation that began to wash away the suffocating mass of inefficiency, corruption, and isolation \u2014 the transformation that unlocked the potential of billions of humans who had been trapped behind walls \u2014 cooperation boundaries! If we can help that happen, and help it happen sooner, before it is too late for so many people, then it will have been worth it, whatever else happens.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 30}

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology (S&T) directorate requested that Sandia set up a graphical user interface or a front end on the Sandia research environment so DHS agents can test the algorithms Sandia is using in actual investigations. The result of Sandia\u2019s work could eventually be delivered to other federal law enforcement agencies.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Sandia, adopting a position that is now becoming widespread among financial operators, institutions and administrations, is persuaded that Bitcoin is here to stay and is poised to have a disruptive but positive impact on the economy. The problem is that the potential for anonymity offered by Bitcoin has been and continues to be exploited by criminals to escape detection.\n\u201cIn many ways, figuring out how to effectively combat illicit Bitcoin commerce and reduce its perception as a tool of criminals can encourage more people and companies to adopt Bitcoin for legitimate purposes,\u201d said Sandia researcher, Andrew Cox, who is leading the project.\n\u201cOur job was to understand how Bitcoin works,\u201d added Cox. \u201cBitcoin is a new, semi-anonymous currency that holds the potential to change the way all sorts of transactions work in a way that might really benefit the economy. Some of the potential benefits include making monetary transactions much more efficient and thereby driving down the costs of doing business, making transaction histories more transparent, which could help both financial markets and financial regulation and, depending on who you ask, reducing the risks associated with inflation and reliance on centralized monetary institutions. All that being said, it has been clear that criminals have been pioneers in using Bitcoin. They use it for drugs, for guns, child pornography and all sorts of terrible stuff.\u201d\nA solution is abandoning Bitcoin and re-using specific aspects of its underlying blockchain technologies to create non-anonymous digital currencies with some of the other desired features of Bitcoin \u2014 cheap transactions permanently recorded in a tamper-proof ledger. This is the approach followed by \u201cpermissioned blockchains\u201d and current plans for central bank issued digital currencies.\nHowever, it\u2019s not certain that a permissioned, centrally controlled blockchain could leverage the network effect that powers Bitcoin. Legendary cryptographer Nick Szabo and other experts are persuaded that banks should embrace the crowd-sourced power and resiliency of permissionless blockchains like Bitcoin.\nAnother solution is to de-anonymize bitcoin transactions with blockchain network analysis tools such as those developed by companies like Elliptic and Chainalysis. In fact, bitcoin transactions are not anonymous. The full transaction history of any bitcoin address, including every transaction associated with that address, is permanently recorded in the tamper-proof public blockchain and is open to analysis. The illusion of anonymity stems from the pseudonymous nature of bitcoin addresses, which are not explicitly associated with their owners, although blockchain network analysis can often de-anonymize bitcoin users. This is Sandia\u2019s approach.\nAccording to Cox, there is no \u201csilver bullet\u201d algorithm to effectively de-anonymize Bitcoin. To do so would involve cross-referencing anonymous data with other, traditional sources of investigative data to identify suspects. \u201cTo be successful, the reality is it\u2019s going to take different types of algorithms and additional types of investigative techniques including good old-fashioned police work,\u201d said Cox. \u201cThey\u2019re all going to have to be combined.\u201d\nThe Sandia team set up a research testbed to experiment with algorithms that can de-anonymize illicit Bitcoin users, including a mix of traditional and novel investigative techniques. Of course, the criminals try to evade detection by using different bitcoin addresses, but the Sandia research results show that known methods often reveal that the same users are using the different Bitcoin addresses.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that we get their actual names because there aren\u2019t any names associated with Bitcoin,\u201d said Cox. \u201cBut it will show that some transactions are controlled by the same user.\u201d Then, when one of the transactions is de-anonymized and linked to a criminal, law enforcement will be able to refer back to the rest of the associated Bitcoin addresses they need to deal with. \u201cOur clients are happy about the requirements we\u2019ve developed and the research we\u2019ve done on what types of tools and capabilities are needed,\u201d concluded Cox.\nThe researchers are now in the process of generating their own methods by characterizing transactions of Bitcoin users and applying machine learning methods to uncover patterns of interest.", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 25}
{"title": "New Algorithm Manages Bitcoin Price Volatility for Everyday Users", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/new-algorithm-manages-bitcoin-price-volatility-for-everyday-users-1472506926/", "birthday": "Aug 29, 2016  5:42 PM EST", "date": "2016-08-29 22:42:00", "content": "Bitcoin prices are fun, if you like roller coasters. For traders who see volatility as an opportunity to make money and are willing to accept the risks, this is great. However this volatility presents a risk for long-term investors, fund managers and businesses who use digital currency for day-to-day operations. The newly launched algorithm for Bitcoin trading, TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price), could save both money and headaches for people and companies not equipped for higher risk.\nBenchmarking Your Trades\nOn January 15, 2016 at 21:58 GMT (Figure 1), the price for bitcoin was $390. In an hour, it dropped to $365. I\u2019m sure you have your own annoying price drop stories. This kind of volatility creates multiple challenges. First, it increases risk; and second, it makes it difficult for your stakeholders to know whether you are providing them a fair price.\nCompanies using Bitcoin for operations rely on the price of bitcoin. If in one hour \u2014 about the time it takes for six confirmations \u2014 the price of BTC can swing by 7 percent (and it does!), companies need to add a buffer to account for it. Thus, volatility increases the overall cost of using digital currency.\nStakeholders care about your Bitcoin trading strategies. This includes the CFOs of firms (e.g. Bitcoin mining firms), your limited partners, suppliers, merchants and customers who are relying on you to get them the best price. Using digital currency is risky enough for customers, and asking them to take on additional trading risk is cumbersome. They don\u2019t ask you to predict the market but they do ask that you give them a fair rate.\nOne way to evaluate and communicate your performance is to use a benchmark. A good benchmark averages out the volatility and provides you with a price that your stakeholders can trust. Digital currency fund managers, for example, use benchmarks to evaluate their trading strategies and make sure they are not undertaking additional risk. Payment companies who have inflows of digital currency throughout the day often use a benchmark rate to communicate to their customers.\nHow TWAP Works\nTo gauge trading performance, many traders in different asset classes (equity, fixed income, currency) often use average price as a benchmark. The two common ways to calculate an average are a time-weighted average price (TWAP) and a volume-weighted average price (VWAP). TWAP is the average price of a bitcoin over the course of a specified period of time and VWAP is price multiplied by number of bitcoins traded, and then divided by the total number of bitcoins traded during a time period.\nWhile these benchmarks are great, they are not very useful if you can\u2019t trade on those prices. If you have to commit to a benchmark and don\u2019t have any tools to make sure you can get that price when trading, you are now exposing yourself to additional risk. To solve the problem, we propose a time-weighted average price algorithm which will get you as close as possible to TWAP.\nThe algorithm trades over the desired time, either 1, 6, 12 or 24 hour(s), and will give you a TWAP over that time period. For example, if you set the TWAP algorithm to sell 12 bitcoins over 12 hours, the algorithm will sell throughout the period, aiming to get a 12-hour TWAP.\n\nHow Good Is It?\nAs good as a safety bar on a roller coaster. Using historical data, SFOX simulated how the TWAP algorithm would perform. We ran simulations on multiple days with high and low volatility. We also ran simulations at different lengths. Included below are two different simulations.\nThe x-axis represents specific minutes. At any given minute (time=0), a trader has a choice: she could trade now (open) or in an hour from now (close), or she could use a TWAP algorithm during that hour. The chart shows the open price (price you would get if you traded at a specific time), a close price (price one hour from the open price) and the TWAP price.\nTWAP does exactly as expected\u200a\u2014\u200ait gets an average price. We also included a VWAP graph to show you what the volume-weighted average price during that hour would be.\nOur TWAP algorithm comes fairly close to VWAP and TWAP in the simulations. The performance of the algorithm depends on market conditions, liquidity, volatility, time of day and size of the order.\nWe also ran a simulation over a 12-hour period, given the option to trade at the beginning of the period (open), at the end of the 12-hour period (close) or using TWAP. Also provided for reference is the VWAP calculated over a one-hour period. As expected, TWAP came fairly close to the average price over a 12-hour period.\nWith TWAP, loss aversion bias can kick in. If bitcoin\u2019s price moves +$30, the trader using TWAP to sell would have yielded a lower amount (~+$15) and thus may feel bad about \u201cleaving money on the table.\u201d Average doesn\u2019t always feel good but keep in mind the trade-off yields stability and reduced risk.\nWe all want to minimize risk; however, the question is, are we willing to pay the price by settling for an average price? Many of us think we can time the market better than the rest (aka overconfidence bias). No one aspires to buy or sell at an \u201caverage\u201d price. In an average, half the time you are on the winning side, while the other half of the time you are on the losing side. That means, given our loss aversion bias, the times when we lose will cause us to feel more pain. The fact is, risk mitigation is important and averages are a bedrock in that strategy. (It\u2019s all risk vs. reward: lower the risk, lower the reward.) Think of TWAP as dollar cost averaging, an important tool to help minimize risk. You can\u2019t predict where the market is going, so why put all your money in at once? If you don\u2019t use TWAP and lose to the full price swing, you will feel even worse.\nFor a number of types of investors and strategies, TWAP is ideal \u2014 and especially so when trading a large number of bitcoins.\nThis is a guest post by Akbar Thobhani, CEO of SFOX.com.

{"title": "Darknet Customers Are Demanding Bitcoin Alternative Monero", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/darknet-customers-are-demanding-bitcoin-alternative-monero-1472243603/", "birthday": "Aug 26, 2016  4:33 PM EST", "date": "2016-08-26 21:33:00", "content": "Kyle Torpey is a freelance writer and researcher who has been following Bitcoin since 2011. His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nThe dark web has started to embrace Monero, a privacy-conscious alternative to Bitcoin.\nFirst, the operators of SIGAINT, a commonly used dark web email provider, decided to host a full node for Monero light wallets. Then, an eight-month-old darknet market called Oasis decided to allow vendors to accept Monero. Finally, Alphabay, the largest darknet market in operation right now, announced the first phase of Monero implementation on their platform.\nWhy Monero?\nStaff members at Alphabay and Oasis say that customers and vendors have simply demanded the Monero option. \u201cIt's a lot more secure than Bitcoin, especially when it comes to obfuscation,\u201d said an anonymous member of the Alphabay support staff.\nAlthough the darknet marketplaces tend to get negative press, the reality is that many of them bend over backwards for their customers; at least until they (some of them) \u00a0exit scam. \u201cWe have received a lot of requests about it; we've studied the cryptocurrency, and we've decided to implement it,\u201d said an Oasis staff member. \u201cThis is what we do when users (both customers and vendors) suggest that we implement or change features. We love to hear back from everyone.\u201d\nThe hidden service set up by the operators of SIGAINT acts in a manner similar to Electrum for those who are familiar with that particular Bitcoin wallet. The hidden service allows individuals to use lightweight Monero clients as opposed to running a full node on their own. When visiting the hidden service via the Tor Browser, information about Monero is shown, including the following message:\n\"The SIGAINT operators firmly believe that Monero is the next logical step in Darknet commerce. It solves most of the privacy problems that plague cryptocurrency systems such as Bitcoin.\"\nBitsquare and ShapeShift.io appear to be the two options for obtaining Monero via Tor at the moment.\nWhy Not Dash or Zcash?\nIn addition to their reasons for supporting Monero, the SIGAINT operators have reasons not to prefer other options, such as Dash or Zcash. In the case of Dash, the site operators are wary of possible collusion by that digital currency\u2019s supernodes. With Zcash, the operators are concerned about the company\u2019s registration in the United States, the fact that mixing is done on an opt-in basis and the possibility of secret inflation initiated by the maintainers of the system.\nThe site operators also claim CoinJoin is not enough to maintain transaction unlinkability in Bitcoin. In a Reddit comment, Bitcoin Core contributor Luke-Jr seemed sympathetic to this viewpoint. \u201cOnly a fool would use Bitcoin as it is today for darknet,\u201d he stated.\nThe staff members of Alphabay and Oasis seemed less inclined to talk about other privacy-centric digital currencies. \u201cHaven't read about [them] yet,\u201d said an Alphabay staff member when asked about Dash and Zcash.\nOne staff member from Oasis, which runs on donations, made it clear that they\u2019re mainly interested in keeping their customers happy:\n\n\u201cUsers requested the Monero implementation; we wouldn't have done anything without their request. There are tons of other cryptocurrencies out there and we obviously cannot implement them all. We will always be based first on our users\u2019 feedback.\u201d\n\nWhat Does This Mean for Bitcoin?\nBitcoin\u2019s main value proposition is as a fungible, bearer ecash that cannot be censored or tracked, but it\u2019s unclear whether Monero will be able to chip away at the leading digital currency\u2019s nearly $10 billion market cap. The price of Monero roughly doubled in the aftermath of these darknet announcements before coming back down to the 0.007 BTC area.\nAlthough staff members from Alphabay and Oasis did not seem philosophically married to Bitcoin in their comments to Bitcoin Magazine, Monero faces many challenges on the road toward more widespread adoption on the dark web or as a store of value. Even Riccardo Spagni, a well-known Monero developer, does not tell people they should buy Monero. Instead, he views it as a place of experimentation for features that cannot currently be tested on Bitcoin. It\u2019s possible that this sort of testing will take place on Bitcoin sidechains in the near future.\nEven in a scenario where Monero gains traction on the dark web, it\u2019s unclear if that would be enough for it to become a preferred store of value. Bitcoin still has a much longer track record and a much more liquid market, so it\u2019s possible that darknet market customers and vendors will use Monero as an appcoin more than anything else, even if moving in and out of the Monero system would harm their privacy.\nThe push toward Monero on the dark web is a development worth watching, but it\u2019s not the first time a darknet market has accepted an alternative, privacy-conscious digital currency.

Thus the IoT concept has not flourished and instead, each company has all of its IoT-connected products registered to its own private back-end database or cloud service and interactions are limited mostly to content provision.\u201d\nThe Chronicled platform also serves as a solution to an intriguing problem dealt by developers and users in the telecommunications industry. That is, telecommunications firms prefer to host their own cellular phone networks and private databases instead of leveraging an interoperable network for other companies and organizations in the industry to access.\nSuch barriers between telecommunications service providers and others in the industry, including developers, users and manufacturers restrict the development and emergence of innovative applications, platforms and products.\n\u201cThis siloed architecture of the IoT today is much how the Internet was back in the earliest days, prior to the invention of the open internet protocol,\u201d said Orr. \u201cThe Open Registry for IoT solves this siloed architecture problem in IoT by using a blockchain as the underpinning network and provides an open protocol to support secure registrations of private property to this new network to support the consumer IoT.\u201d\n\u201cWe are excited that our Bluetooth low energy chip customers now have the opportunity to register and verify their chips on a public blockchain,\u201d Silicon Labs\u2019 IoT Products Senior Vice President and General Manager, Daniel Cooley, said in a statement. \u00a0\u201cThis interoperable back end is a valuable building block and positive step for the entire IoT ecosystem including app developers, brands and consumers alike.\u201d\nOver a short period of time, Chronicled has already deployed nearly 10,000 NFC and BLE chips in its decentralized blockchain network. The successful deployment of physical items in a blockchain network suggest that the the billion-dollar industry of IoT is close to being unravelled by startups.\nRecognizing this potential of the Chronicled platform, its Chief Technology Officer, Maurizio Greco, stated that the company is providing open-source tools to help developers in building products and applications with smart phone scan and authentication functionalities. Greco hopes to see developers leveraging the identity of a physical item as a basis to protect digital content.\nThe Chronicled development team has had envisioned unique implementations of its IoT platform and expects developers or companies to make full use of its platform\u2019s ability to insure, collateralize, protect and secure content.\nFor instance, a digital content creator could sign a product such as a photo, film or song with a digital chip. Then, a patron can use the smartphone to authenticate the content, protecting its ownership.\n\u201cThis new blockchain-powered Internet of Things network can support all of the activities consumers want to do with property,\u201d said Orr. \u00a0\u201cAfter all, the blockchain is known as the \u2018value web.\u2019 Imagine 'things' that can be programmable and interactive and many libraries of plug-ins making it easy to build ecommerce, logistics, social, finance, gaming and insurance apps to interact with physical property in many new ways. This new blockchain-supported Internet of Things can become far more valuable to brands and consumers than any network to date in the IoT space.\u201d\nVitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, has expressed his optimism regarding the IoT industry and the applicability of the blockchain technology in the area. Buterin believes that Chronicled creates a bridge for developers and users to a new IoT ecosystem that hasn\u2019t been exploited before.\n\"Consumer IoT has always been one of the areas of blockchain adoption that I have been most bullish about, and I am excited to see Chronicled's efforts in pushing IoT authentication use cases a step further,\u201d said Buterin.\nAccording to Orr, the Ethereum blockchain is ideally suited to Chronicled since it is moving to PoS [Proof of Stake] with Casper; thus, it will provide a \u201ccheaper solution for item registration, which is better for brand corporate social responsibility,\u201d with less energy wasted than on the Bitcoin Proof of Work system. Orr also cited Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts\u2019 ability to \u201cenable \u2018programming of the protocol\u2019 for registering items and better flexibility and scalability\u201d as attractive features.\nToday, there are billions of NFC and BLE microchips in existence. If the Chronicled platform begins to deploy more physical items and assets in its network, it will provide developers and users an opportunity to experience previously unseen methods of protecting, insuring and transferring assets in a decentralized network.\nLooking ahead, Orr expects that \u201call consumer and luxury products can become interactive from your smart phone and can be programmed with content, experiences and services via BLE and NFC chips embedded in the products. The blockchain can serve as a backbone for registering and verifying IoT product and device identities and will lead to a consumer IoT that is much more robust than was possible with the older Internet 1.0 architecture.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 26}

UBS, a Swiss global financial services company with its headquarters in Basel and Z\u00fcrich, is the biggest Swiss bank and is considered the world\u2019s largest manager of private wealth assets, with more than 2.2 trillion Swiss francs (CHF) in invested assets.\nThe new virtual currency, dubbed \u201cUtility Settlement Coin\u201d (USC) would be used for post-trade settlements between financial institutions on private financial platforms built on blockchain technology and permit settlement of \u00a0trades in seconds rather than days, with reduced risk and operational costs. To achieve this vision, UBS partnered with Clearmatics, a developer of \u201cpermissioned\u201d blockchain technology. Permissioned blockchains, where only authorized operators can validate transactions are supported by banks and traditional financial operators wary of the open, permissionless Bitcoin blockchain and the perception of its troublesome anarchy.\nNow, UBS has joined forces with Deutsche Bank, Santander, BNY Mellon and ICAP to propose the USC to central banks, aiming for its first commercial launch by early 2018. \"Cash is a leg to almost every trade, so this project is key to unlocking the benefits that the industry can gain from distributed automation technology in clearing, settlement and collateral management,\u201d said Clearmatics Founder and CEO Robert Sams.\nThe group will collectively build on the successful outcome of initial explorations of the USC concept, performed by UBS and Clearmatics, notes a joint press release issued by UBS, Deutsche Bank and ICAP.\n\u201cThe focus of the work will consist of financial structuring of the USC and wider market structure implications as well as market integration points for a fully operational utility settlement coin for future use by institutions,\u201d states the release. \u201cAdditionally, Clearmatics is tasked with delivering early releases of the technology platform to underpin the concept. Active dialogue with central banks and regulators will continue to ensure a regulation compliant, robust and efficient structure within which the USC can be deployed.\u201d\nThe USC is defined as an asset-backed digital cash instrument, implemented on distributed ledger technology and fully backed by cash assets held at a central bank, for use within global institutional financial markets. In September 2015, UBS and Clearmatics launched a first pilot project, part of the UBS Crypto 2.0 Pathfinder Program, to validate the USC concept. The successful conclusion of the pilot indicated that the USC project was ready for the introduction of additional partners.\n\"Digital cash is a core component of a future financial market fabric based on blockchain technologies,\" said Hyder Jaffrey, head of Strategic Investment & FinTech Innovation at UBS Investment Bank. \"There are several digital cash models being explored across the Street. The Utility Settlement Coin is focussed on facilitating a new model for digital central bank cash.\"\nIt\u2019s especially interesting to speculate about the future of the USC and its potential to become a global standard electronic currency for settlements, adopted by major banks and financial operators. The Financial Times notes that banks are now exploring how they can exploit distributed ledger technology to speed up back-office settlement systems and free billions in capital tied up supporting trades on global markets. The total cost to the finance industry of clearing and settling trades is estimated at $65 billion to $80 billion a year.\n\"Recent discussion of digital currencies by central banks and regulators has confirmed their potential significance,\u201d said Julio Faura, head of R&D at Santander. \u201cThe USC is an essential step towards a future financial market on distributed ledger technologies,\" Saket Sharma, head of Treasury Services Technology at BNY Mellon, added that the USC initiative provides \u201can exciting opportunity to work closely with other industry thought leaders and the regulatory community to explore the possibilities of this technology.\u201d\nA Santander press release notes that the group is already in contact with central banks and regulatory authorities to ensure the launch of the USC in a solid and efficient framework that meets all regulatory requirements. Persuaded that blockchain-based digital cash represents the future of financial markets, the group is planning wider trial projects before the 2018 launch.", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 25}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nFormer Reddit Cryptocurrency Engineer, Ryan X. Charles, is currently working on a new, bitcoin-powered social network, but he isn\u2019t focused on creating something that will only be used by the Bitcoin community. In a recent interview on Epicenter Bitcoin, Charles noted that creating an app used by a mainstream audience would have much more value than simply creating /r/Bitcoin with micropayments.\nCharles\u2019s new platform is called Yours and the main goal is to create a way for content creators to get paid for their digital content directly from their audiences. Although he used to work at Reddit, Charles has noted that Yours is not simply a decentralized version of that social media platform.\nFinding a First Non-Bitcoin Community for Yours\nDuring the interview, Charles made it clear that Yours is currently searching for the first key community or demographic that the platform should try to attract. \u201cI\u2019m sort of vague about this now, but who are our core users?\u201d he questioned. \u201cWhat is community number one here?\u201d\nThe reason Charles is somewhat vague on this point is because Yours has not yet identified the community that they should target first. Although many people within the Bitcoin community have heard of Yours, this is very much an unknown project among the general public and even among the general tech community.\nSome think it would make sense to first focus on the Bitcoin community as a core batch of users, but Charles was quick to dismiss this idea. \u201cIf we made Reddit but with Bitcoin, I bet Bitcoin users would use it; however, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in anybody\u2019s interest that we do this first.\u201d said Charles. \u201cBitcoin users would probably most benefit from it if we create something mainstream.\u201d\n\u201cEverybody in the Bitcoin space wins if we start servicing people outside the Bitcoin community,\u201d Charles added.\nCharles\u2019s argument is essentially that they\u2019ll learn much more about what they\u2019re building if they go after a community that is unrelated to Bitcoin. This way, Yours will be better able to understand whether they\u2019re solving a real world problem or just creating another Bitcoin community forum. By going this route, Yours will also be able to ensure that their platform is not so complex that it can only be used by bitcoiners.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really important that we identify one community to be our core audience [who] are not already Bitcoin users,\u201d concluded Charles.\nThe Manga Example\nManga was the one area of interest that Charles brought up as an example of a community that may be interested in using Yours. \u201cI\u2019m not a big manga fan, but there are a lot of reasons why we think that audience might be good for us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re really sort of young, sophisticated people that create manga, which are Japanese comics, and there are huge communities of these people . . . They\u2019re creating content. They\u2019re not really able to monetize this in any way, but if they had a way to monetize it, they would love to do this full time.\u201d\nCharles went on to explain that Yours could target the manga community by telling them they can earn real money by creating and discovering new, quality manga. He added that Yours could make sure that their product gave the manga community all of the tools they need to easily post and earn money from their art.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say that manga would necessarily be the first user, but something like that,\u201d added Charles. \u201cIt\u2019s a niche community. It\u2019s outside of Bitcoin. Not everyone likes manga, but the people that do like it really like it.\u201d\nOnboarding New Bitcoin Users via Yours\nOne last point on the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and Yours that was discussed on this episode of Epicenter Bitcoin was the issues involved with onboarding new users to this decentralized payment system. \u201cIt\u2019s still kind of difficult to get [bitcoin],\u201d said Charles. \u201cWallets have improved a lot over the years, but they\u2019re still kind of technically sophisticated.\u201d\nIn the past, traditional online payment options have also had to deal with this onboarding issue. In the case of PayPal, they handled it by literally paying new users to join their platform. \u201cThat is not out of the question for us,\u201d Charles said, regarding PayPal\u2019s strategy. \u201cIf we raised a bunch of money, we could do that . . . I don\u2019t think we necessarily have to do that though.\u201d\nIt should be noted that those who wish to create or view content do not need to have any bitcoin to use Yours. The use of bitcoin is only required when a user wishes to support someone else\u2019s content via a payment.\nCharles also mentioned the Coinbase Buy Widget as another easy way to onboard new Bitcoin users. The widget allows users to instantly purchase up to $5 worth of bitcoin per day with limited Know Your Customer restrictions.\n\u201cYou just have to make it fluid for the users to get on and off,\u201d said Charles.", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 30}
{"title": "Back to School: Blockchain Education Network to Host Global Bitcoin Airdrop", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/back-to-school-blockchain-education-network-to-host-global-bitcoin-airdrop-1472663104/", "birthday": "Aug 31, 2016  1:05 PM EST", "date": "2016-08-31 18:05:00", "content": "This September, blockchain hubs across North America will be giving out bitcoin to begin the next school year. Over a dozen regions including New York, San Francisco, Chicago and Boston in the United States and Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and Ottawa, in Canada, are preparing their events. The giveaway, known as a Bitcoin Airdrop, has become a yearly tradition on university campuses.\nThe bits are to be given to students who come out to their local blockchain club\u2019s first meeting. Students will also be introduced to concepts about bitcoin and the blockchain through their peers and a demonstration of a wallet creation and transfer.\nHistory of the Airdrop\nThe first airdrop was hosted in 2014 by the MIT Bitcoin Club, after the club raised $500,000 worth of bitcoin to give to each incoming freshman. The event was then replicated in 2015 in Montreal by the McGill Cryptocurrency Club during their school\u2019s frosh week, with donations given to the club. The Blockchain Education Network is now expanding the initiative throughout their network of regional hubs.\nWhy an Airdrop?\nAn airdrop allows people who would otherwise never have heard about bitcoin to try out using their first bits with their friends in a setting where their questions can be answered. Even if a student downloads a wallet and sells the bitcoin, they discover how easily it can be exchanged for fiat currency and would be more open to receiving bitcoin as payment at a future time.\nFocus on Education\nThe Blockchain Education Network (BEN) believes that the blockchain revolution must happen through education. Most people are still unfamiliar with what digital currencies and the blockchain are, though almost everyone is curious when they first hear about it and want to learn more.\nBitcoin and blockchains are technologies with broad socio-economic impacts, which means that different parts of the world will have a different perspectives on it. BEN organizes as a swarm, a decentralized organizational model, to ensure that the education presented at each meeting is relatable to the region.\nA Crucial Grassroots Movement for Students\nBEN is comprised primarily of students aged 18-25 and the group believes that it is especially important for this demographic to be able to experiment with these technologies. The world is quickly moving into a sharing economy where people can operate remotely and companies have access to a global talent pool. Students will all enter the workforce after graduating and must be familiar with new technology.\nEach year, the leadership from a university club graduates and must be replaced by the incoming class of students. Doing an airdrop at the beginning of each school year ensures a strong interest in blockchain technology and many new students joining the blockchain community in every region that participates.\nIn addition to the airdrop, BEN has an entire Fall 2016 initiative to bring new students into the blockchain ecosystem including a Blockchain Olympics event in October and a Blockchain Startup Gauntlet in November. BEN also hosts and promotes hackathons for students with a variety of skill sets, and assists students who are interested in attending bitcoin and blockchain conferences.\nFuture Implications\nThis initiative has become a tradition that can scale as wide as its reach. 500 students receiving bitcoin this September may not change the world; however, each year showing a new group of motivated university students how this technology works may cause a ripple effect of education that reaches farther than our expectations.\nIn our view, the \u201cblockchain revolution\u201d isn\u2019t so far fetched. This is a technology which better maps to our worldviews after having grown up with the internet. It has taken 25 years for the internet to move from creation to our pockets. Through this historical lens, we see any current shortcomings of blockchain as an opportunity for our generation to solve.\nGet Involved\nBEN is always looking for new industry partners and leaders of local bitcoin or blockchain hubs who would like to participate in their global network. If you would like to be involved, the best way is to join the conversation in their Slack channel. Sponsors or regions who want to participate in the airdrop should reach out to the BEN directors directly at contact@blockchainedu.org.\nThis guest\u00a0post was\u00a0co-written by Michael Gord, creative director, and Dean Masley,\u00a0executive director of the Blockchain Education Network.", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 31}

The company raised $1.25 million of seed funding from influential financial market leaders, then in January it closed a $7 million funding round. In May, Bitcoin Magazine reported that Symbiont is working with Delaware, the state that incorporates most companies, to explore the use of blockchain technology to make its paperwork cheaper and more efficient.\nNow, Symbiont has announced that it has appointed Caitlin Long as President and Chairman of the Board of Directors. Long, a financial heavyweight with 22 years of corporate finance experience including stints at Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, will be responsible for commercializing Symbiont's blockchain technology, encompassing business strategy and client relationships.\n\"Caitlin brings a rare mix of deep Wall Street experience and recognized thought leadership about blockchain technology. She is the embodiment of our name and brand,\" said Mark Smith, CEO and co-founder of Symbiont. \"Caitlin has a strong philosophical and economic foundation that allowed her to build her career by always putting the needs of her clients first. She has repeatedly proven her ability to help clients see new ways to solve problems and clients rewarded her with top market positions in every one of her businesses. We are thrilled that she's joining our team.\"\nSymbiont has developed a platform that allows financial market participants to create programmable \u201cSmart Securities,\u201d self-executing digital contracts stored in a distributed ledger. Symbiont\u2019s platform allows users to issue, manage, locate and trade Smart Securities in a global peer-to-peer financial network.\n\"Blockchain technology will make capital markets safer, fairer and more efficient,\" said Long. \"I chose to join Symbiont because we have better technology and are ahead of our peers. Symbiont offers the only smart contracts platform purpose-built for financial services. Investors will actually own the assets issued on Symbiont's blockchain, which is a huge improvement relative to how securities are owned today.\"\n\"Our priority from here is to broaden the market reach of our tech. \u00a0It works and is already going into production,\u201d Long told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe think the performance numbers we disclosed today will garner a lot of attention from potential consumers, many of whom are kicking the tires on this new technology.\"\nThe performance numbers to which Long is referring are detailed in a blog post, authored by Long, titled \u201cWhy I Chose to Join Symbiont.\u201d\nOne of the two main reasons that motivated Long\u2019s decision to join is that investors will actually own the assets issued on Symbiont\u2019s blockchain which, according to Long, is a huge improvement relative to how securities are owned in today\u2019s market structure. The second reason is that Symbiont\u2019s platform can store all transaction data and documentation in a secure, anonymous manner without sacrificing speed.\n\n\u201cSymbiont\u2019s ledger is currently processing 80,000 transactions per second in a single region and tens of thousands per second globally. Plus, transaction latency is on the order of milliseconds. So Symbiont\u2019s software is not just outperforming all competitors whose comparable statistics we know \u2014 it\u2019s outperforming them by multiple orders of magnitude.\u201d\n\nSymbiont was co-founded by members of the Counterparty project who had participated in the first development phase of Overstock\u2019s \u201ccryptostock\u201d exchange, Medici, now known as t0. Overstock wants t0 to become an alternative to traditional stock exchanges like the NYSE or Nasdaq, said Judd Bagley, Overstock communications director and t0 Chief Evangelist in a Distributed interview.\nThe Hyperledger Project, an initiative of the Linux Foundation, is also developing an enterprise-grade, open-source distributed ledger framework and codebase. Hyperledger\u2019s technology aims at clearing and settling transactions in real time, with a throughput of thousands of transactions per second. However, actual performances reported by developers on the Hyperledger mailing list are significantly lower, which seems to support Long\u2019s claim.\nLong notes that Symbiont, which has kept a low profile so far and prioritized building its technology to create a first-mover advantage, is already implementing its platform at a production level. \u201cOur publicly disclosed customers include the State of Delaware (Delaware Public Archives project) and a top European insurance company (catastrophe swap pilot project),\u201d says Long. \u201cOther customers are not yet disclosed.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 31}

Its four core divisions \u2014 content creation & acquisition, documentary division, rights management platform and TVOD Brand/Portal \u2014 allow creators to display, distribute and produce films, television properties and music while protecting their copyrights in one single platform.\nThe SingularDTV team and its CEO Zach Lebeau believe that the platform will lead to the development of new monetization methods and will eliminate monopolistic distribution that inevitably lessens the profit of artists and filmmakers.\n\u201cIt [the platform] will give artists control over setting usage policies for their created content and pay them instantaneously when their content is watched, rather than having to participate in the monopolistic and obfuscated distribution machine of the legacy entertainment industry that ends up eating away at their potential profits,\u201d Lebeau told Bitcoin Magazine in an interview.\nJoseph Lubin, CTO of SingularDTV, further emphasized that artists and filmmakers will be able to maximize their earnings by eliminating the presence of third-party institutions or mediators like Netflix and YouTube to manage and distribute their content. The platform is gearing towards a consumer-to-creator network in which consumers may access the creator\u2019s works without accessing an external application.\nThrough the utilization of smart contracts, consumers will be able to make payments according to the indications of each smart contract of the creators.\n\u201cA consumer will be able to navigate and catalogue and find something to watch and click on an appropriate usage policy to pay the artist instantly and directly for the content that we\u2019re receiving and using,\u201d said Lubin.\nImportance of Ethereum and Local Tokens\nBefore Ethereum was introduced to the digital currency industry, Lebeau and his team attempted to utilize the Bitcoin network and ecosystem to build the SingularDTV platform. However, Bitcoin\u2019s lack of infrastructure made it difficult for developers to create applications using scalable frameworks.\nThe Ethereum network, which is primarily based on smart contracts, has since allowed the SingularDTV team to create a decentralized and scalable platform with which they can integrate various applications to handle various operations.\n\u201cThe Ethereum blockchain represents the best possible potential to achieve the construction of a scalable decentralized entertainment industry. We believe the most innovative and progressive minds in blockchain tech are developing on Ethereum, which gives it long-term viability,\u201d said Lebeau.\nMore importantly, the Ethereum platform has enabled the SingularDTV team to create a localized token called SNGLS that is programmed with \u201cthe terms and conditions of SingularDTV and its intellectual property,\u201d rather than simply using ETH, which is just the gas that fuels the Ethereum blockchain.\n\u201cWe\u2019re entering into the 'Age of Tokenized Ecosystems',\u201d said Lebeau. \u201cThis is the beginning of a next great tech boom where trillions of dollars worth of real world assets will be decentralized and placed onto the blockchain in the coming years. \u00a0SNGLS tokens are the decentralized representation of SingularDTV intellectual property \u2014 our film, TV and software projects. The tokens are the company and represent the CODE structure of SingularDTV.\u201d \u00a0\nLebeau added that the details of the CODE structure were developed in partnership with ConsenSys and Swiss law firm MME, among the architects of the Ethereum Foundation, with assistance from legal innovator Luka Muller, who is at the forefront of the legal/tax structure for tokenized ecosystems.", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 1}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin right now is  not really anonymous. While Bitcoin addresses aren't necessarily linked to real-world identities, they can be. Monitoring the unencrypted peer-to-peer network, analyses of the public blockchain and Know Your Customer (KYC) policy or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations can reveal a lot about who's using Bitcoin and for what.\nThis is not great from a privacy perspective. For example, Bitcoin users might not necessarily want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own; similarly, businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors.\nAdditionally, the fact that the transaction history of each bitcoin is traceable puts the fungibility of all bitcoins at risk. \u201cTainted\u201d bitcoins, for example, may be valued less than other bitcoins, possibly even calling into question Bitcoin's value proposition as money.\nThere are potential solutions that may increase privacy and improve fungibility in Bitcoin. But most of these solutions are either partial, works-in-progress or just largely theoretical.\nTo reclaim their privacy right now, therefore,\u00a0some  bitcoiners have begun to utilize one of its competitors: the altcoin Monero.\nThe Bitcoin Scenario\nPerhaps the main reason Bitcoin does not offer a whole lot of privacy is that different transactions are easily linked together.\nThis is because all Bitcoin transactions consist of inputs and outputs. Inputs refer to addresses bitcoins are sent \u201cfrom\u201d and outputs refer to addresses bitcoins are sent \u201cto\u201d. Naturally, then, outputs from one transaction become inputs in the next. The receiver of one output and the sender of the subsequent input are usually the same person.\nMoreover, since most transactions are made by one person only, all input addresses typically belong to that same person as well. Meanwhile, that one person usually sends bitcoins to only one other person per transaction. That means that if there are two different outputs, one of these must be a change address, used by the sender to send excess bitcoins back to himself.\nAll these links in the chain make individual bitcoins traceable; it\u2019s possible to determine in which transactions a certain bitcoin was previously used, thereby potentially harming fungibility and decreasing privacy, as all these links allow blockchain analysts to figure out which bitcoins likely belong(ed) to whom.\nThe Monero Scenario\nAs opposed to the majority of altcoins, Monero is not based on Bitcoin\u2019s code-base or protocol. Instead, the cryptocurrency, launched in 2014, is based on the CryptoNote reference implementation, an altcoin that was designed from scratch.\nMonero was created by the pseudonymous developer thankful for today, who was himself effectively \u201cfired\u201d by the community less than a month after Monero\u2019s launch, as the project was forked away from him. It has since been led by a core team of seven developers, including Riccardo \u201cfluffypony\u201d Spagni and Francisco \u201cArticMine\u201d Caba\u00f1as. Its native curreny, XMR, is one of the top altcoins by market cap, and is now accepted as payment on several dark net markets.\nIn Monero, the basic structure of Bitcoin transactions still holds up: each consists of inputs (\u201cfrom\u201d) and outputs (\u201cto\u201d). But there are two key differences. For one, outputs can only consist of rounded decimal numbers. So instead of an output worth 15.7 XMR, there will be three outputs, worth 10, 5 and 0.7 XMR. And the change outputs are also rounded. So if the input was worth,\u00a0say, 60 XMR, the change outputs will be worth 40, 4 and 0.3 XMR for a combined output total of 60. Six outputs (40, 10, 5, 4, 0.7 and 0.3), where only the sender and receiver know which ones are payments and which are change. This already makes blockchain analysis a bit harder.\nBut this is really only the setup of the trick.\nRing signatures\nThe actual magic comes from a cryptographic signature scheme called \u201cring signatures,\u201d based on the older concept of \u201cgroup signatures.\u201d Ring signatures exist as several iterations and variations, but all share the property of obfuscating which cryptographic key signed \u201cwhich\u201d message, while still proving \u201cthat\u201d a cryptographic key signed \u201ca\u201d message. The version used by Monero is called \u201cTraceable Ring Signatures,\u201d invented by Eiichiro Fujisaki and Koutarou Suzuki.\nTaking the example above, where an input worth 60 XMR was used to create six outputs, Monero utilizes ring signatures as follows.\nThe sender who created the 60 XMR input must have previously received these 60 XMR as an output of an earlier transaction. After all, he can only create a 60 XMR input if he controls a 60 XMR output first.\nBut with ring signatures, the sender can obfuscate \u201cwhich\u201d 60 XMR output he controlled. Instead, he can take several 60 XMR outputs from different transactions, and bundle them together in such a way that proves he owns \u201cone\u201d of these outputs \u2014 without revealing \u201cwhich one\u201d. And since Monero only works with round numbers, there should be plenty of 60 XMR outputs available on the blockchain to mix with.\nAs a result, Monero transactions are almost completely unlinkable. At best, blockchain-analysts can calculate the odds that transactions are linked, based on how many outputs were used in the mix to create an input. (This is configurable by the sender, with a minimum of three.)\nAnd Back Again...\nSo how does any of this help Bitcoin or Bitcoin users?\nSimple: Monero is used to \u201cunlink\u201d Bitcoin transactions in much the same way that Monero transactions are themselves unlinked.\nSpecifically, Bitcoin users sell bitcoin for XMR, ideally on a Tor-friendly exchange that does not require AML/KYC, like Shapeshift or Bitsquare. Later, they simply sell these XMR back for bitcoin on a different platform, which can also be done on XMR.to. If the buys and sells are spread over time a bit (since low transaction volume on Monero can be a slight giveaway in some cases), this leaves virtually no link on any blockchain at all.\nFor more information on Monero \u2014 which includes additional privacy options as well as other features \u2014 visit  getmonero.org. Using Monero in itself does not always guarantee full privacy; the more precautions taken, the better.", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 1}

It claims to be the first such platform that will allow the kind of \"industrial scale\" decentralized computation and storage to run applications like its social network platform of the same name, which recently went live as an alpha.\nSynereo's long-term aim, however, is to go beyond that flagship application to become a platform for any kind of app at all, removing the need for central servers from the internet altogether.\nTo encourage developers to get on board, Synereo has also launched a grant program worth about two hundred thousand dollars US and paid in the network's native currency AMP. The funds will be distributed to development teams who want to work on decentralized apps and the platform itself.\nThe Technology Stack:\u00a0RChain\nSynereo's material describes the Technology Stack as a four-layer system consisting of (from bottom-up): new blockchain technology called \"RChain\" or \"Blockchain 2.0\"; a distributed storage and content delivery protocol called \"SpecialK\"; its programming language for smart contracts and distributed apps called Rholang; and then the applications themselves.\nThe purported advantage of RChain over existing blockchains is twofold, which Synereo says makes it cheaper, faster and much more scalable.\nFirst, it regularly shards, i.e: subdividing into parts that can be cryptographically linked in a chain, but which do not hold all the data \u2013 thus preventing the blockchain's storage size from becoming massive, as with existing chains. Second, processes run concurrently, meaning the subdivision allows different actions to take place in parallel without affecting others.\nThe consensus protocol used to secure RChain is based on Casper, a proof-of-state system developed in cooperation between the Ethereum project and Synereo\u2019s CTO, Lucius Greg Meredith. One key difference to Casper is RChain's validation of \"logical propositions\" \u2014 information derived from the blockchain regarding what should be included, rather than entire blocks themselves.\nOther Layers:\u00a0Language and Apps\nSynereo separates this system state layer from the one holding media data like videos and images, which distributes storage across the network and delivers it to users on demand. The SpecialK protocol is a form of distributed hash table (DHT) which also includes a monadic domain-specific language, allowing developers to access and deliver distributed data. The protocol also conceals this data when it is not needed.\nThe team describes Synereo's native smart contract language, Rholang (Reflective, Higher-Order process Language), as safer than similar languages like Ethereum's Solidity and more similar to established reflective programming languages like Java and C#.\nHad The DAO been built with a reflective language like Rholang it may not have suffered the same fate, Synereo claims, and \"industrial scale\" decentralized applications are not possible without the deployment of such a language.\nThe Social Network\nSynereo's most prominent application to date is the Social Network, which launched as an alpha version two weeks ago.\nTouting privacy and censorship resistance as its main features, it also runs on the AMP currency token. AMP fuels a network economy where advertisers and ordinary users wishing to get attention for their content.\nDue to the social media aspect and the concept of a native token for use within the ecosystem that can also be traded on third-party exchanges, Synereo draws inevitable comparisons with Steemit.\nMany still understand the name Synereo to refer to the social network only, as it has gained the most attention so far. The project team aims to rename it sometime after launching officially, differentiating it from the wider decentralized app platform.\nFundraising Efforts So Far\nAccording to a company spokesperson, Synereo has raised about eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars US so far, with one hundred twenty three dollars US of that total coming from an initial coin offering (ICO) that ran from March 2015.\nAn upcoming fundraising campaign, he said, will be a combination of an equity offering for qualified investors through BnkToTheFuture (minimum $1K) and a further sale of already-existing AMP tokens.\nAMPs will also be offered on BnkToTheFuture.com, synereo.com/sale and YUNBI at a fixed price, starting at thirty three thousand satoshi per AMP. The price will increase at different stages of the one-month sale and offer bonus AMPs depending on the number purchased.\nThe AMP currency at this stage exists on the Omni protocol, which itself is based on the Bitcoin blockchain.\nFinding Users\nOnce the technology is fully released late next year and grants are given to developers, Synereo will need to start a drive to onboard new users \u2014 no mean feat in a universe where social networks like Steemit are already rewarding contributors with proprietary tokens privacy concerns with centralized networks like Facebook, not dissuading millions from using them.\nSynereo's spokesperson admitted \"there is still quite a bit of work to be done first,\" with efforts focused on building and funding the technology infrastructure itself for the time being.", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 5}

In April, it\u00a0raised US$1.6 million in a Series A funding round from Bitmain, one of the world's largest manufacturers of bitcoin mining hardware.\nOTC trading was introduced in May as a solution for peer-to-peer trading. According to Ruby Chan, BitKan's marketing director, the app has grown in popularity, especially over\u00a0the past two years. The company now serves some \"millions of users in total and over one hundred thousand registered users.\"\nIn July, the company triggered its global expansion plans, starting with releasing OTC trading functions for overseas markets on its mobile apps. When asked which markets have seen the most notable growth, Yang said that it is still too early to tell, although \"we could foresee that Russia is really a large market.\"\nBitKan is now working toward developing its current businesses, including OTC trading and polishing its apps \"to offer the perfect service to our users,\" Yang said. The company plans to launch a brand new, re-designed website. Next week, it will kick off its BitKan OTC Referral Program which will allow registered users to earn bitcoins by referring friends to the trading service.\nThe next steps for BitKan will include\u00a0promoting its products in international markets and \"[trying] to find the right shoe on the global stage,\" Yang said.\nThe company is also exploring the \"strategic layout for Bitcoin applications\" as well as other possible use cases for the technology.

In May, Shanghai-based nonprofit research institution, Wanxiang Blockchain Labs,\u00a0announced a new consortium called the ChinaLedger Alliance. The coalition, consisting of 11 regional financial institutions, aims at creating \"an open source blockchain protocol that developers can further build upon in the future.\"\nThis was followed by the establishment of a\u00a0new blockchain working group in August, a three-way strategic alliance among the government, ChinaLedger and the Shenzhen Consortium, seeking to \"pool the wisdom of collaborative innovation\" to harness blockchain potential and gear up for what could well be the next \"technological revolution,\" according to Ministry of Industry and Information Technology Software Services Division Director Xie Shaofeng.\n\"In the industry of blockchain in China, the research [is] in full swing,\" Yang said. \"Although there are still certain bubbles, all will come out in the wash.

The announcement stated that the forthcoming version of the Brave browser, planned for April, would include micropayments and a built-in Bitcoin wallet. It has taken a bit longer, as it usually happens in innovative tech, but Brave micropayments and Bitcoin support are finally here.\nBrave announced the beta version of Brave Payments, a Bitcoin-based micropayments system that can automatically and privately pay the favorite websites of Brave users, integrated in the recent 0.11.6 release of Brave for desktop.\n\u201cFor the first time in the history of web browsers, people can now seamlessly reward the sites whose content they value and wish to support, while remaining untracked by anyone, including us at Brave Software, Inc,,\u201d said Brave founder,\u00a0Brendan Eich. \u201cThis removes the need for intermediaries who may overwhelm web pages with invasive trackers and ads (and sometimes even malware).\u201d\nEich, who is also the creator of the Javascript programming language and the former CEO of Mozilla, added that users are tired of the current ad-tech ecosystem that clogs their web pages and data connections with annoying ads and tracking pixels and scripts. \u201c[They] would be happy to go ad-free if they could instead funnel their support directly to the websites they visit,\u201d said Eich. \u201cBrave Payments now makes it possible for such users to try sending small payments to sites, at whatever aggregate support level they choose.\u201d\nThe core defining feature of the Brave browser, replacing annoying resource-hungry and privacy-unfriendly ads with clean and light ads, is that it is now and will remain free. \u201cBrave is a browser that blocks ads by default and it will always be free,\u201d states the Brave Payment FAQ. \u201cIf you can afford to support your top sites, we encourage you to try Brave Payments, but you do not have to pay to use Brave.\u201d\nBrave partnered with BitGo to build custom wallets for Brave users. As soon as a user enables Brave Payment, a wallet is created automatically by the system. The wallet, which is tied to the computer (integration between different wallets belonging to the same user is forthcoming), can be funded with monthly contributions (minimum $5 per month) from an external Bitcoin wallet. The company has partnered with Coinbase to allow users without an existing Bitcoin wallet to fund their Brave wallet with a credit or debit card via Coinbase. Brave has also partnered with Private Internet Access, to mask the users\u2019 IP addresses.\nThe monthly contributions of Brave users are split among the sites visited by contributors, based on a combination of visits and time spent on each site. The analysis is done without revealing user identities via the Anonize protocol over the network and via statistical voting on devices. The site publishers can collect their payments by verifying their ownership of the site with a procedure similar to that used to veryfy the ownership of a domain.\n\u201cStandardizing anonymous micropayments will take years of effort before something cross-browser can be added to the Web\u2019s specifications,\u201d said Eich, adding that he hopes to build \u201ca truly private (even decentralized) eventual standard for web payments.\u201d\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Eich to find out more. Please read also our previous interview, where Eich elaborated on Brave\u2019s business model and overall philosophy, influenced by legendary internet pioneers like Ted Nelson and Jaron Lanier.\n\u201cWe definitely want to standardize anonymous micropayments for the Web, for example,\u201d Eich told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cAlso anonymous ads of a better kind, if possible. But it's a fatal mistake to standardize prematurely, so we need users first to have leverage with competitors in standards bodies. The biggest browsers are owned by advertising and platform companies who \u2018own the user\u2019 from device purchase onward, so they face strong incentives against building and standardizing what we're developing. Nevertheless, we hope as we grow to partner with other browsers who share our user-first and user-data-only-on-device principles. We can already see some kindred few in the field.\u201d\nAs Eich notes,becoming one of the top browsers will be a very difficult task. Eich is unable to share data on the growth of Brave\u2019s user base at this moment. \u201cWe are growing but not publishing our numbers yet and not advertising or growth-hacking until 1.0 when we can retain users who expect a full feature set, especially in comparison to other top browsers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe'll publish in due course. Things are growing well and we benefit greatly from publicity around our innovations as we release them.\u201d\nThe Brave Payment announcement and FAQ have extensive information for publishers, which Eich summarizes as follows. \u201cWe are launching the beta with domain-owning publishers as first model,\u201d Eich told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe will grow to pay users who are tenants of the big \u2018platform\u2019 landlords (YouTube, Facebook, etc.) in subsequent releases. This requires paying a URL owner in full, not just a domain name owner, as the tenants do not each own a domain name.\u201d\u201cWe use a challenge-response protocol inspired by ACME (letsencrypt and other CAs use this) to verify domain ownership, but for path (user account on YouTube, e.g.) ownership we'll need to do more. We are inspired by tiptheweb.org and other past attempts to pay URL owners (not just domain owners), and I wanted to tip my hat to tiptheweb.org in particular.\u201d\n\u201cAfter verification, content creators come and get their bitcoin and we can develop an ongoing business relationship as is appropriate. For small publishers and eventually account-holder \u2018tenants\u2019 on the platforms, everyone may be fine using BTC and keeping things simple. For big publishers we will have more to offer down the road, in the way of safe/anonymous indirect ads, and ways to confirm direct-sold ads without tracking or any loss of privacy.\u201d\nThe Brave approach could seem too involved when one thinks that users could pay their favorite websites directly, but persuading readers to pay for content and subscribe to their favorite online magazines is proving difficult.\n\u201cThat's being tried, constantly, and conversion through paywalls is pretty low, I hear less than 5 percent,\u201d said Eich. \u201cUsers do not want to sign up at hundreds of sites and give out credit card or other payment information. It's not happening. Blendle came to the US this year but as far as we can tell, growth is poor and most users are still in the Netherlands. This is just one example.\u201d\nBrave\u2019s business model is centered on building its own ad network to replace the expensive, slow, resource-consuming and privacy-unfriendly ads of the main ad networks. However, that\u2019s not happening yet.\n\u201cWe are not doing Brave Ads yet and we are not planning to do them for mobile as display ads, either,\u201d explained Eich. \u201cThis is all down the road a few months in terms of trial programs, as we bring big publisher partners on board for trials. Nothing we released today has Brave Ads elements in it.\u201d\nEich\u2019s first blog post is still a good summary of Brave\u2019s long term vision and roadmap. \u201cThe details have evolved but the main principles are user-first (meaning we serve users \u2014 not advertisers, search engines, operating system or other software vendors or device makers) and user-data-defended-on-device (we don't track and we blind ourselves to user data and identity by default),\u201d noted Eich. \u201cTo make this a viable business built on those principles, we align our interests with our users, by sharing revenue at par (e.g. 15 percent of gross ad revenue to each of us and our user), and by vigilantly blocking and compensating for bad ads and other abusive web content.\u201d\n\nThis is why I picked the name \u2018Brave\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe need users who will take a stand and fight back,\u201d concluded Eich. \u201cWe're not just looking to get along with everyone in the existing ecosystem that evolved on the Web. In particular, we see third-party ads and tracking as toxic, and we block by default. But we'll fight for the users wherever their interests markedly diverge from those holding the network power-centers on the Web.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 2}

The project now has more than 80\u00a0members, which represents a growth of 170\u00a0percent in the last six months.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a tremendous response to our vision for creating an open community for blockchain technology and we\u2019re proud to be celebrating this member milestone,\u201d said Brian Behlendorf, executive director of Hyperledger Project, in an\u00a0announcement which includes a list of the new companies that have joined the project. \u201cAt a growth rate of nearly two new members joining per week, there\u2019s no telling where we\u2019ll be at by the end of the year. I look forward to working with this growing community to further our open blockchain development efforts.\"\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Behlendorf to learn more about\u00a0the project's direction, vision and strategy.\u00a0\n\u201cHyperledger has racked up impressive growth in new member companies, new developers, new releases of all our projects (Fabric, Sawtooth Lake, and Explorer) and our profile continues to grow,\u201d Behlendorf said.\u00a0\u201cWe see continued growth in our core projects, perhaps the addition of new projects before the end of the year and further releases of those existing projects on the path to 1.0 for each of them.\u201d\nThe Hyperledger Project is developing open source technology for new distributed ledgers separated from the Bitcoin blockchain. Many high-profile members of Hyperledger, notably Accenture and Digital Asset Holdings CEO, Blythe Masters, have expressed support for \u201cpermissioned\u201d blockchains which would offer the advantages of digital currencies powered by public blockchains; fast and cheap transactions permanently recorded in a shared ledger, without the troublesome openness of the Bitcoin network. This suggests that Hyperledger as a whole could support the permissioned approach which, according to experts, couldn\u2019t reproduce the powerful network effect that has made Bitcoin popular.\nBehlendorf doesn\u2019t think Bitcoin will fade out and be replaced by permissioned blockchains. \u201cPermissioned chains do not solve all the interesting problems out there,\u201d he commented. \u201cI think Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrency and distributed application platforms have a long, bright future. Specific currencies may come and go, but the problems they solve are real and worth solving and there are incredibly active user and developer communities around each. I think we'll also find over time that there are many shades of grey between \u2018permissioned\u2019 and \u2018unpermissioned\u2019 and I'd love to explore that whole spectrum with projects at Hyperledger.\u201d\nAt the same time, Behlendorf is not persuaded that permissioned blockchains couldn\u2019t reproduce Bitcoin\u2019s network effect. \u201cThere's no inherent reason why a permissioned chain couldn't have a very large pool of nodes and participants,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThere is hard, technical work to do to make that possible. Distributed ledgers are more like databases than networks, though, some \u2018network effects\u2019 look more like the network effect of everyone using SQL, even if they're using different technology stacks.\u201d\nHowever, the libertarian early adopters of Bitcoin continue to resist the current trend toward mainstream, regulated distributed ledgers, and there is the possibility that that new blockchains with strong privacy, (like the upcoming Zcash), will fill the initial role of Bitcoin. Therefore, perhaps we are moving toward a dual system with a mainstream \"sanitized\" blockchain for banks and underground blockchains used for untraceable internet transfers.\n\u201cI don't think it'll play out like that, precisely,\u201d commented Behlendorf. \u201cWe'll have many public chains and technologies (I think Zcash looks really cool, technically) and many, many private chains, because there are many different kinds of communities and use cases, and expecting one chain to meet them all is unrealistic. We should be asking ourselves how we maximize the amount of re-use and code-sharing between the software driving all those chains. That's what we're hoping to help with at Hyperledger.\u201d\nSee also our previous interview with Linux Foundation executive director, Jim Zemlin.", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 5}

Through its mobile apps, Zebpay allows users to buy and sell bitcoins for Indian rupees, buy airtime top-ups, pay bills and buy Amazon vouchers.\nOver 3.5 billion INR (US$52 million) worth of bitcoins have been traded over Zebpay so far, and the startup has been welcoming 20,000 new users every month. Zebpay is now looking for additional capital to fuel its expansion plans. \"Bitcoin is just the first step in the new 'digital asset revolution,'\" Goenka said. \"We aim to be India's leading digital asset company.\"\nAlthough bitcoin adoption in India has had a slow start, awareness is growing rapidly. Bitcoin trade grew exponentially in recent months and currently stands at an estimated 5 billion INR (US$75 million) in volume per year. This remains tiny compared to China's trading activity where traders buy and sell over US$100 million worth of bitcoins every day,\u00a0according to Nikkei Asian Review. \"India is where U.S. and China were in 2013,\" Goenka said.\nBitcoin adoption has moved from attracting early adopters to attracting other segments \"like young professionals and HNIs [high net worth individuals],\" he said.\n\"Users are now using bitcoin as an alternative investment. They are also using it for online shopping, airtime top up, paying bills and buying gift vouchers. We believe India will see an explosion of bitcoins in the next two years.\"\nOne particular area where bitcoin could have a significant impact is remittances. India is the world's biggest remittance recipient, attracting in 2015 some US$69 billion,\u00a0according to the World Bank. Leveraging Bitcoin and related technologies could help senders and recipients save up to US$7 billion in remittance fees, Goenka said.\n\n\"The majority of the remittance is small amounts of around US$200. For small amounts especially, users end up paying up to fifteen percent in fees to companies like PayPal, Western Union or to banks through transfer and exchange rate fees. Bitcoin makes it extremely easy to send a small remittance back home.\"\n\nFinancial inclusion is another area where Bitcoin and mobile technology could have a positive impact by allowing rural populations and the underbanked to access basic financial services. In addition to Zebpay, companies like Coinsecure have been finding success both in the remittance market and in reaching out to this segment of India's population.\n\"About forty percent of the population across the country do not have bank accounts,\" Goenka said. \"Bitcoin wallets could be used in remote areas without the need for brick and mortar banks. India is perfect as a society to be at the forefront of developing a vibrant cryptocurrency economy.\"\nAlthough bitcoin may hold promise for developing markets like India, the digital currency has proven to be a challenge for \"non-geeky regular people.\"\n\"Indians are looking for a safe and simple way to buy and store bitcoins,\" Goenka said. \"However, with existing solutions, besides wrapping their heads around bitcoin, they also have to understand complex ideas like bitcoin addresses, network confirmations, network fee and wallet backups.\"", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 5}

Students and young professionals had the opportunity to interact with seasoned experts, successful entrepreneurs and investment-industry icons from around the United States.\nLocated in the heart of San Francisco, the day was filled with an array of topics including bitcoin, drones and the Internet of Things to name a few.\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to producer of the MoneyShow University and a Millennial himself, Jordan Berger, who said that bitcoin is well suited to Millennials who tend to have a distrust to government.\n\u201cBitcoin is a private currency that is not backed by any government, central bank or organization which makes it appealing to most. Also, low transactions costs make doing business with bitcoins more affordable, convenient and secure, three factors that young people highly value.\u201d\nBerger added that he believes that bitcoin will be attractive to the younger generation who seem to understand technology better than any previous generation.\n\u201cThey are always looking for the next big thing and have shown support for initiatives that make an impact in their lives in a meaningful way,\u201d he said. \u201cWith adoption of bitcoin globally, young people can travel the world, without having to convert their currency, [as] bitcoin has no borders.\u201d\nHe added that the younger generation are the future and without them, digital currency does not have a chance at mass adoption.\nOne of the discussions that took place at the MoneyShow University was \u201cBitcoin Is Global: A Discussion with Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss,\u201d which explored the global market opportunities in digital asset trading and management, the importance of working constructively with regulators and the future of digital assets as a next-generation investment vehicle.\nIn October 2015, the Winklevoss brothers launched their Gemini Trust Company as a fully licensed, regulated digital asset exchange in New York City. In May 2016, the company became the first-ever licensed bitcoin and ether exchange and in June of this year, Gemini\u2019s operations grew to include Canada, with plans to expand into Europe, East Asia and elsewhere.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, panel discussion presenter and Bitcoin reporter for Forbes, Laura Shin, said that it was very early to make predictions regarding the future of digital assets as a next-generation investment vehicle. Looking at the changes and activities over the last two years, however, there are more professional traders and institutional investors with things likely to grow, she added.\n\u201cOn the horizon we have a number of different investment products or services that make it easier for them to trade products. At some point, in the next few years, there is probably going to be a bitcoin ETF and there will be price indexes coming out that will make it easier to create other products based on bitcoin. Based on these things that are in the works that haven\u2019t yet launched and also from the trends we are already seeing, it looks like this is going to grow.\u201d\nShin also cautioned that a lot can change. She mentioned setbacks such as bitcoin exchange hacks and The DAO fiasco, stating that it is probably going to be a bumpy road but that the general trend is toward more availability and activity.\nThe next MoneyShow University events will take place in Toronto on September 16, 2016 and in Orlando on February 10, 2017.\nNote: While Laura Shin is a contributing reporter at Forbes,\u00a0the opinions expressed are her own.", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 6}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nKim Dotcom, the notorious internet entrepreneur and Megaupload founder, has been building hype for the relaunch of his file-sharing website on Twitter and various media outlets over the past few weeks. While the general tech community seems interested in what Megaupload 2.0 will have to offer, the Bitcoin community is more interested in one specific aspect of this new project.\nWhile discussing Megaupload 2.0 on Twitter, Dotcom noted that the file-sharing platform will include a way to attach a bitcoin transaction to every uploaded file. Dotcom has named this feature Bitcache.\nThe specific details as to how Bitcache works are still unknown to the general public, but Dotcom noted that the system will work in a way that is similar to an affiliate program on a recent episode of the\u00a0Keiser Report. Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Dotcom to get further clarification on his short description of Bitcache.\nA Bitcoin-Powered Affiliate Program for the Web\nWhen asked for more details about Bitcache, Dotcom was quick to point out that his new project enables a variety of different features. He then shed some light on how Bitcache could be used in a way similar to an affiliate program.\n\u201cOne feature is an affiliate system that allows any third-party site to provide income to people who drive traffic to their websites,\u201d said Dotcom. \u201cFor files, videos, news stories, music, any kind of content and recommendation. This can be accomplished in many different ways, by sending traffic via social media, your contacts, a blog or a website that can drive traffic. Uploaders of popular content will benefit.\u201d\n\u201cThird party sites will be able to use Bitcache not just Megaupload 2.0,\u201d Dotcom clarified further.\nIn other words, Bitcache will be a platform that can be used by any content creator to pay people for driving traffic to their website (among other uses). This puts Bitcache in a category with Brave, Yours, Popchest and other Bitcoin-powered micropayments projects that offer new options for content creators on the internet.\nCopyright Infringement Not Tolerated on Megaupload 2.0\nAlthough the original version of Megaupload was shut down by the United States Department of Justice due to allegations of operating an organization with the sole purpose of copyright infringement, Dotcom says Megaupload 2.0 will not allow copyright infringement activity to take place.\n\u201cThere are clear rules [for] what content qualifies and what doesn't,\u201d said Dotcom. \u201cCopyright infringement for example would be against our rules and infringing files can easily be removed via takedown procedures.\u201d\nDotcom has stated these sorts of protections also existed in the past, on the original version of Megaupload.\nMore Details to Be Revealed\nDotcom was willing to clarify his analogy of Bitcache as an affiliate program a bit, but the technical details of how this system works under the hood are still not available. \u201cDetails will be revealed at launch,\u201d said the Megaupload founder.\nThere are a variety of questions that still remain for the Bitcoin community. How are these micropayments possible when Bitcoin network fees are currently around seven or eight cents? How decentralized can the system be while solving the issue of relatively high-cost, on-blockchain transactions? How will the affiliate program deal with sybil attacks?\nAnswers to these questions will likely come in time, although it\u2019s clear that Dotcom is a master of building hype around his new ventures. The Bitcoin community will certainly be paying attention when the details of Bitcache and Megaupload 2.0 are announced in January.", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 6}

Bitcoin has been occasionally mentioned in Silicon Valley, Aaron Sorkin\u2019s The Newsroom and the current (second) season of Mr. Robot, as well as being the dark web currency of choice in CSI: Cyber. Now the launch of GenCoin, a fictional digital currency inspired by Bitcoin, is the main theme of techno-thriller StartUp, the new Crackle show launched on September 6.\nCrackle is a multi-platform video entertainment network of full-length movies, TV shows and original programming. It isn\u2019t Netflix, not yet, but it\u2019s becoming more and more popular due to its free viewing, ad-supported business model. Founded in the early 2000s as Grouper, the company was acquired and re-branded by Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2007 and started producing original content made for the internet.\nWhen thinking of digital currencies, two places come to mind: Silicon Valley, where genius geeks develop the underlying cryptographic mathematics and code and Wall Street, where deep-pocketed and often ruthless financiers exploit virtual money to make lots of real money. But StartUp is set in Miami and soaked in the unique light-and-dark atmosphere of the sprawling city; white beaches, palm trees, shiny high-rises and seedy slums.\nAnd of course, lots of sex, steamy as it must be, though not very relevant to the story. It appears that Sony wanted to have all the ingredients for a successful show, including an excellent cast. However, it\u2019s much too early to tell if StartUp will be a success and catapult Crackle to the top.\nIzzy Morales (Otmara Marrero) is a young Cuban-American genius programmer with a stellar record at Stanford. Now back in Miami, she is looking for money to launch the new digital currency, GenCoin. Morales, a talented hacker who operates server hardware racks besides developing code, meets potential funders and venture capitalists in Brickell\u2019s Avenue, Miami\u2019s tropical Wall Street, with cold reactions.\n\u201cSorry, is it like PayPal?\u201d a distracted manager at a seed capital investment firm asks Morales. A less distracted colleague then mentions Bitcoin. \u201cBitcoin is a cute idea,\u201d says Morales, but adds that it is \u201csusceptible to third-party interference and ultimately corruption.\u201d\nEveryone says that money corrupts people \u2014 according to Morales, however, we fail to recognize that people corrupt money. \u201cGenCoin can put an end to that. It offers more stability, security and anonymity than any digital currency out there,\u201d explains Morales. \u201cGenCoin is a currency in and of itself. It runs off a complex algorithm that took me almost seven years to develop. It predicts, adjusts and adapts to market and political shifts in order to remain stable.\u201d\nMorales is looking for a $100,000 seed investment to launch a minimum viable prototype that, she hopes, will allow her to raise the $12 million she needs for an operational product. Ultimately, she wants to change the world by making secure and anonymous payments available to the \u201cunbanked\u201d in the developing world, a huge population of billions of people who can\u2019t have a bank account but do have cell phones, which is all one needs to use GenCoin. The distracted manager, who is now paying attention, notes that the big banks won\u2019t like the idea.\nHere, things in the real world are different: mainstream financial operators are warming up to the advantages of digital currencies and appropriating the underlying blockchain technologies for their own use.\nWe don\u2019t learn much more about GenCoin in the first StartUp episode. While the potential world-changing impact of \u201cbanking the unbanked\u201d is often mentioned by Bitcoin enthusiasts, the interesting aspect of GenCoin is its ability to predict, adjust and adapt to market and political shifts. This short remark of Morales and the large servers that she operates, suggest the idea of sophisticated artificial intelligence and machine-learning algorithms that require a lot of computational and electrical power. It\u2019s to be hoped that the next episodes \u2014 the first season of StartUp has ten episodes \u2014 will show more about how GenCoin works.\nOf course the investors dismiss Morales with a \u201cdon\u2019t call us, we\u2019ll call you\u201d put-down. But Nick Talman (Adam Brody), a junior staffer of the investment firm, sees the potential of GenCoin. It so happens that Tolman has two million dollars worth of dirty money from his estranged father, a banker who got the money from dangerous people. Talman decides \u00a0to use the money to fund Morales.\nBut the money comes from the criminal underworld of Miami, and the first episode ends with Haitian gang member, Ronald Dacey, ambushing and assaulting Tolman in his apartment. Having seen what Dacey is capable of, we are left with the impression that Talman is about to be killed. But the StartUp official trailer and clips of forthcoming episodes available on Crackle\u2019s YouTube channel show that Dacey, who is not an entirely bad person, will eventually become a partner.\nThe fourth main character is FBI agent, Phil Rask (Martin Freeman), who is following the money trail. There are indications that Rask isn\u2019t an entirely nice guy and it seems likely that the conflict between the FBI and the GenCoin team will be interesting.\nIn summary, StartUp seems a robust techno-thriller with commercial potential and the first season of the show will offer ten hours of solid entertainment as well as stimulating reflections on the role of digital currencies in today\u2019s society.", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 7}

Meanwhile, Ripple's Asian branch has announced a new bank consortium to build and deploy a blockchain-enabled platform for payments and settlements.\nJapan's internet and e-commerce giant Rakuten has opened a new blockchain lab in Belfast, Ireland, dedicated to developing blockchain applications for the fintech and e-commerce sectors. The launch of the Rakuten Blockchain Lab (RBL) follows the firm's acquisition of Bitnet Technologies, a bitcoin startup specializing in merchant payment solutions.\nRakuten, which participated in Bitnet's US$14.5 million Series A funding round in late 2014,\u00a0had been partnering with the startup since March 2015 to allow bitcoin payments on its e-commerce platform.\nThe new lab is headed up by Bitnet co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Stephen McNamara and Vice President of Engineering Fergal Downey.\nAccording to Yasufumi Hirai, group executive vice president, CIO, chief information security officer (CISO) and head of the Technology Division of Rakuten, Inc., RBL is the \"first step forward unlocking blockchain's potential to revolutionize the way the financial and e-commerce transactions are conducted.\"\n\"We want to not only prepare for that change, but take a leading role in making it happen,\" Hirai said, as\u00a0quoted by Rakuten Today.\nThe launch of RBL come simultaneously with the announcement of a new bank consortium in Japan led by SBI Ripple Asia, Ripple's Asian arm.\nThe group plans to build and deploy a blockchain-based settlement platform for both foreign and domestic exchange services. The platform, which will be using Ripple, is expected to be ready by March 2017, according to a media release from SBI Ripple Asia, a joint venture between SBI Holdings and Ripple.\nStarting from October 2016, the consortium will start exploring new types of payment and settlements services that utilize blockchain technology. The idea is to find a solution that would allow for 24-hour or real-time settlements of large sums as well as small-value settlements for remittance needs. The solution will also need to be \"borderless\" to address cross-border e-commerce needs and facilitate Japanese companies' expansion into other Asian countries.\nCalled the \u201cConsortium for Considering Using Blockchain Technology to Centrally Provide Domestic and Foreign Exchange Services,\u201d the initiative includes the Bank of Yokohama, Ltd. and SBI Sumishin Net Bank as inaugural members. It is expected to grow to 15 bank members by October and to a total of 30 by March 2017.\nThis is the second blockchain consortium that is being launched in Japan and follows the establishment of the\u00a0Blockchain Collaborative Consortium (BCCC) in April 2016, an initiative focusing on researching, developing and deploying blockchain technology.\nBCCC comprises 34 founding member companies from the fintech, technology and bitcoin sectors, including Microsoft Japan, Consensus Systems (ConsenSys) and Tech Bureau.\nIn July, SBI Holdings and Mizuho Financial Group, Inc., one of the largest financial institutions in Asia,\u00a0began trialing blockchain technology for cross-currency settlement using Ripple. The set of trials, dubbed the \"Sora Project,\" is being conducted in collaboration with the R3 blockchain consortium. It is expected to be completed by the end of the year.\nSince Mt. Gox, once the world's largest bitcoin exchange platform, collapsed in 2014, Japan had remained cautious toward blockchain technology and digital currencies.\nEarlier this year, Japan enacted a\u00a0new bill to regulate \"virtual currencies,\" defining these as something with an \"asset-like nature\" that can be exchanged for goods and services.\nThe revised law, which will go into effect within a year of its promulgation, will require\u00a0virtual currency exchanges to register with the country's Financial Services Agency.\nIndustry participants and entrepreneurs have welcomed the new regulations, arguing that these will increase trust and confidence in the industry.", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 24}

Blockchain has turned into a catch-all phrase for anything involving a shared ledger or database but the technology was first created by Satoshi Nakamoto for the purpose of tracking and confirming Bitcoin transactions.\nBlockchain technology has been hyped for use everywhere from traditional banking institutions to the healthcare industry and some have gone as far as to say that generalized, private blockchains will have a much greater\u00a0impact on the world than Bitcoin. However, there have been hints that this trend is on the verge of a reversal. One of the latest signs of the reemergence of Bitcoin is the batch of startups accepted into the fourth round of the Plug and Play Fintech program.\nOf the 24 startups accepted into the program, six are working with the Bitcoin blockchain in some capacity.\nFocus on Bitcoin Startups\nThe six Bitcoin-related startups in this round of Plug and Play Fintech are Eximchain, Netki, Shocard, The Sun Exchange, Tierion and Tradle.\nInterestingly enough, The Sun Exchange is the only one using bitcoin as a currency. The startup allows international users to invest in solar panel projects around the world and they\u2019re currently focused on the Southern Africa region.\n\u201cWe are rather special in that we offer bitcoin holders the opportunity to invest in a product that produces a financial return in BTC,\u201d The Sun Exchange CFO Larry Temlock told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cFor those people that want to buy and hold BTC for the long term, this attractively high investment yield can provide a sort of \u2018buffer\u2019 against unfavorable decrease in BTC value vs other currencies or assets and perhaps make the spot currency market volatility a little less painful for those that are holding bitcoin for the future.\u201d\nEximchain and Tierion are hashing data into the Bitcoin blockchain for use as an immutable database. Netki is a startup that has been focused on replacing long, confusing Bitcoin addresses with human-readable wallet names and they were also involved in the development of BIP 75. Shocard and Tradle have a focus on allowing users to prove their identities to third parties through the use of the Bitcoin blockchain.\nBlockchain Companies Still Present\nOf course, there are also a few startups focused on the more general concept of blockchain technology in the fourth batch of Plug and Play Fintech startups. Nuco,\u00a0a project started by Matthew Spoke, Jin Tu and Kesem Frank, three former members of Deloitte\u2019s blockchain team, is focused on building customized, private blockchain solutions across various industries.\nThe Stellar Development Foundation, which supports a Ripple spin-off, was also part of this round of Plug and Play Fintech startups.\nSome of the above-mentioned Bitcoin companies also have aspects of their business plans that go outside of the Bitcoin blockchain. Netki now offers Digital Identity Certificates, which can work across all private and public blockchains and The Sun Exchange also relies on the use of various \u201cblockchain-based applications\u201d on their crowd investing platform.\nShocard CEO Armin Ebrahimi told Bitcoin Magazine: \u201cWhile we use the Bitcoin blockchain, our platform is blockchain agnostic and in fact, we do write to multiple blockchains and can relate the data cohesively. The blockchain however is fundamental in providing our identity solution.\u201d\nWhat Will These Startups Gain From Plug and Play?\nWhether they\u2019re involved with Bitcoin or some other form of blockchain technology, all of these startups understand the value of Plug and Play Fintech.\n\u201cWe were thrilled that [Plug and Play] invited Tierion to join their program,\u201d Tierion CEO Wayne Vaughan told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cEach week, we're meeting with enterprise customers that we've met through [Plug and Play]. It's a great way to accelerate our business development efforts and build our network in Silicon Valley.\"\nNetki CEO Justin Newton also shared his excitement about the program with Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cOur Wallet Name product has been proven in the Bitcoin ecosystem and with the launch of our Identity Certificate product we are seeing strong interest from traditional financial enterprise customers. Being accepted into Plug and Play from their hundreds of applicants gives you amazing access to their corporate partners, who know you have already gone through a rigorous selection process. This will help us accelerate both traction with those companies, but as importantly, an opportunity to get detailed feedback on product market fit and any adjustments that will need to be made to make our products fit better.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 22}

", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-core-is-released-what-s-new-1471877163/", "birthday": "Aug 22, 2016  10:46 AM EST", "date": "2016-08-22 15:46:00", "content": "Aaron van Wirdum is interested in decentralized consensus, FOSS, privacy in the digital age, censorship resistant payments, and more of that stereotypical Bitcoin stuff. Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin Core 0.13.0, the thirteenth generation of Bitcoin's reference client as first launched by Satoshi Nakamoto almost eight years ago, has now been\u00a0tagged for release.\u00a0This is one of the final steps in the software release process and initiates the Gitian build process.\nBitcoin Core 0.13.0 was developed by some 100 contributors over a period of about five months. And while much of the development effort over this time has also been focused on Segregated Witness, which will be activated only in a future minor release of the software, Bitcoin Core 0.13.0 includes about a dozen notable improvements compared to Bitcoin Core 0.12.0.\nThese are the most important changes.\nChild Pays for Parent\nThe number of transactions on the Bitcoin network has been steadily growing over time. As a result, more blocks have been filling up, and miners typically charge higher fees to include transactions into blocks. Transactions that don't include sufficient fees usually take longer to confirm, or perhaps even never confirm at all. This has proved to be somewhat problematic, especially in periods where so-called \u201cstress tests\u201d were conducted on the network, with spikes in the total number of transactions on the network and substantial transaction delays.\nIndividual users can solve this problem by including a higher fee in their transactions, incentivizing miners to prioritize these transactions. This is possible even after a transaction is sent, using Opt-in Replace-by-Fee (RBF); however, not many wallets include this option yet. Additionally, RBF is only an option for the sender of a transaction. Up till now, the receiver had no way to bump the fee for an incoming transaction to speed up confirmation.\nThis problem is effectively solved with a trick called \u201cChild Pays for Parent\u201d (CPFP). CPFP is a policy used by miners to select which transactions to include in blocks. With CPFP, miners don't necessarily pick the highest paying (and valid) transactions, but instead pick the most profitable set of transactions. In other words: they will select a low-fee transaction if a subsequent transaction that relies on the low-fee transaction offers a high enough fee to compensate. The miner will include both at the same time.\nIn practice, this means that the receiver of a low-fee transaction can \u201cattach\u201d a high-fee transaction, spending the same coins to himself. Incentivized by the new, high-fee transaction, a miner will include the set of transactions. As such, the receiver won't have to wait as long for a confirmation, while the miner can increase his income.\nCompact Block Support\nBitcoin's peer-to-peer protocol is currently somewhat inefficient. Nodes send each other most transaction data twice: once as a transaction as it is initially sent over the network, and once as part of a block when the transaction is confirmed.\nThis has some disadvantages. For one, sending transaction data twice requires more bandwidth than it really should, which adds to the cost of running Bitcoin Core. Second, and perhaps more importantly, forwarding new blocks to several peers at the same time can cause significant outbound bandwidth spikes. This potentially disrupts internet-usage each time a new block is found, which is potentially annoying for users. And perhaps, more importantly, it can slow down block propagation over the network as well. Slow block propagation can, in turn, favor bigger mining pools, thereby incentivizing a more centralized mining landscape.\nCompact Blocks (BIP 152), developed by Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developer Matt Corallo, are designed to decrease excess data-transmission. When a new block is found, nodes initially only communicate very compact hashes of transaction data. As nodes have already received the full transaction data when it was originally sent over the network, they can use these hashes to figure out which transactions are included in the block and reconstruct the block themselves.\nThis trick does not always work out perfectly, however. If a node did not yet receive the initial transaction before receiving the hashes, that node, of course, can't select the transaction. Additionally, in rare cases a wrong transaction may hash into a right hash, fooling the node into believing it received the right transaction until it tries to reconstruct the block and finds it doesn't add up.\nIn both these cases of failure, the node simply requests the specific transaction data after all. Even with only some complete transactions in them, Compact Blocks will transmit over the network much faster, and require significantly less bandwidth.\nHierarchical Deterministic Key Generation\nUp till now, Bitcoin Core generated a new and completely random public and private key pair for each new Bitcoin address. While this is important for security and privacy reasons, it can also be a bit of a burden for users. In order to secure all private keys against loss, they need to make regular backups.\nHierarchical Deterministic (HD) Key Generation (BIP 32), a cryptographic trick developed throughout 2012 and 2013 by Bitcoin Core developers Gregory Maxwell and Dr. Pieter Wuille, and Armory-developer Alan Reiner, solves this problem. With HD key generation, Bitcoin Core creates a completely new key pair for each new address, but all these keys are derived from a single, 12-word seed. As long as users remember this 12-word seed, they can re-generate all private keys and access all their funds.\nIt should be noted that HD Key Generation is not a new feature in the Bitcoin world. Many wallets already included the option for several years. It just never existed in Bitcoin's reference client \u2014 until now.\nPerformance & Security\nAnd of course, Bitcoin Core 0.13.0 introduces a significant list of performance and security upgrades. The full extent of these improvements is beyond the scope of this article (see Bitcoin Core 0.13.0's\u00a0release notes for all the details), but in short...\nThe database cache memory has been increased, which allows nodes to speed up transaction validation and more. The Bitcoin command line tool now allows users to type passphrases and other sensitive information interactively, improving security by not storing this information in plain text. The software is updated to use C++11 and Python 3, newer versions of the programming languages, that allow for more powerful features. ARM (a specific microprocessor architecture) binaries for Linux are now part of the release, so users don\u2019t have to compile this for themselves. Data concerning which transactions in a mempool rely on each other (as utilized with CPFP) can be communicated to external programs. Nodes on the network can request to receive only transactions that meet a certain fee threshold to prevent DoS attacks. And, lastly, there have been a lot of low-level improvements to the peer-to-peer, remote procedure call, and messaging system (ZMQ) protocols.\nThanks to Bitcoin Core lead maintainer Wladimir van der Laan and Bitcoin Core developer and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo for information and feedback.\nNote: Bitcoin Core 0.13.0 was\u00a0officially released on August 23; the original title of this article, announcing its release on August 22, was incorrect. It had been tagged for release, which typically means it will be released within a couple of days. Bitcoin Core 0.13.0 can now\u00a0be downloaded on bitcoincore.org and bitcoin.org.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nEthereum Classic started off as what is perhaps best described as a protest movement, opposing a (perceived) bailout of Ethereum\u2019s leaderless investment venture, The DAO. But the brand new cryptocurrency, which is actually the continuation of the pre-hard forked Ethereum chain, has since surprised many. Its currency, classic ether (ETC) has garnered a spot among the top altcoins by market cap, some big names in the cryptocurrency space endorsed the project and more developers are joining the project. To make it official, Ethereum Classic declared its independence from the former Ethereum project and the Ethereum Foundation last week.\nYet, some questions about the future of Ethereum Classic remain. The initial community consists of a diverse group of users, varying from long-time Ethereum purists committed to upholding the original \u201ccode is law\u201d ethos, to a subgroup of \u201cBitcoin maximalists\u201d that really hoped a split would have both sides of the chain fail and just about anything in between these extremes.\nTo find out whether, and how, the Ethereum Classic community plans to move forward from here, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to some of its most active members.\nA Distinct Vision\nIf there is one aspect that binds the Ethereum Classic community to this day, it\u2019s \u2014 perhaps unsurprisingly \u2014 shared values like immutability and censorship resistance. As formulated in the \u201cDeclaration of Independence,\"\u00a0many Ethereum Classic supporters envision the protocol as an embodiment of the \u201ccode is law\u201d mantra, in which there is no room for forks whenever code doesn\u2019t operate as many users expected it would.\nElaborating on the explicit publication of these values, project lead Arvicco told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cAt least from my point of view and this is how many in our community feel as well, any practical steps we undertake should be based on a firm foundation, laid out in principles. This Declaration of Independence is important, in the same sense way the United States\u2019 Declaration of Independence was important. It turns a mutiny into a revolution, so to say. It may be a formality, but it is an important one.\u201d\nNaturally, then, there is still very little sympathy for the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s decision to opt for a hard fork to reimburse The DAO investors. For many, the perceived bailout of the leaderless investment venture was a big mistake and is still illustrative for the net version of Ethereum.\nMarcus R. Brown currently maintains the Ethereum Classic fork of cpp-ethereum, also known as eth. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Brown \u2014 who joined the Ethereum community late last year \u2014 explained:\n\u201cAfter the news of the The DAO hack broke, I watched the community\u2019s response and in particular the mitigation strategies. Although I held a tiny amount of The DAO tokens myself as a curiosity, I did not agree that either a soft or hard fork was the appropriate response. After the hard fork was implemented and deployed, I assumed my \u2018side\u2019 had lost the argument and decided to continue to explore Ethereum, albeit more cautiously. But when I discovered Arvicco\u2019s manifesto, I decided to contribute time and resources to the project. I am in 100% agreement [with] the principles as laid out and, in fact, think that most of it lines up with the goals of the original Ethereum project.\u201d\nOthers did not hesitate to voice their discontent toward the original Ethereum development community itself, many of whom endorsed and advocated in favor of the hard fork. Like the new Ethereum chain, developers involved with the Ethereum Foundation are by many within the Ethereum Classic community considered morally bankrupt; making a re-united community seem unlikely.\nJames Hilliard, a commercial pool operator who manages over 100HG/s worth of Ethereum mining farms and mining pools for clients, has been encouraging his clients to mine on Ethereum Classic.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, he said:\n\u201cI largely view the Ethereum Foundation as a corrupt group, that\u2019s only in it to get rich. And I think this fork event really caused them to show their true colors. They care about their own profits above everything else ...\u00a0I admire that Ethereum Classic does not want a benevolent dictator at all, just like those in Bitcoin don\u2019t want one. Satoshi leaving Bitcoin development was a good decision in my opinion\u2026 that makes arguments from authority much harder.\u201d\nCreating a New Roadmap\nMoving forward, uniting the community may be a little bit more tricky. Initially, the Ethereum Classic project planned to follow the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s every move, essentially copying any update to their own chain. By now, however, the Ethereum Classic community has begun working on its own roadmap. While a work in progress, this could mean that the difference between the two sides of the chain will further diverge over time.\nCharles Hoskinson was one of the original founders of Ethereum and one of the early public faces of that project. But he left the team almost two years ago, even before the protocol was ever launched. Only recently, he announced his return as developer for \u2014 what is now called \u2014 Ethereum Classic.\nExplaining his motivation to work on a distinct vision for Ethereum Classic, Hoskinson said:\n\u201cA protest movement can\u2019t live forever. We\u2019ve seen that with Occupy Wall Street and there are many similar examples. It\u2019s also not what I find interesting personally. I hope to see Ethereum Classic, this community, emancipate into a valuable network, a real thing that doesn\u2019t merely exist to remind Vitalik and the other Ethereum developers of the mistake they made. If we can do that I would love to participate.\u201d\nA similar sentiment was echoed by Avtar Sehra, another developer to have joined the project, who also works on global strategy for Ethereum Classic.\u00a0Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, he said:\n\u201cLet's be honest. Ethereum Classic can not compete with Ethereum in the fundamentals, funding and traction. For this reason Ethereum Classic will need to become something different. Focus now is on removing the difficulty bomb originally built in by Ethereum developers, that is designed to eventually force the protocol to a new hard fork. We want to fix the replay issue, port as many clients as possible and develop new ones, stabilize the network, build a community and establish decentralized administration operations.\u201d\nProof of Stake\nA popular sentiment within the Ethereum Classic community is to treat the Ethereum Foundation side of the chain as a sort of testnet for now. The forked version of the Ethereum chain could serve as an experimental testbed for innovation \u2014 which in many ways, it already is. Whether or not experiments succeed should determine whether they should be adopted by Ethereum Classic \u2014 or not.\nPerhaps the most obvious example of this, though not the only one, is a potential transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This is scheduled to replace the current proof-of-work system, at least on the forked Ethereum chain. But the Ethereum Classic community is generally skeptical that proof-of-stake \u2014 where order of transactions is determined by coin-holders rather than miners \u2014 is the best way forward.\nAccording to Arvicco:\n\u201cWhile proof-of-work and \u2014 just recently \u2014 hybrid proof-of-work/proof-of-stake security guarantees are well analyzed in peer-reviewed papers, there is nothing like this for proof-of-stake in general, or for Ethereum\u2019s promised proof-of-stake system \u2018Casper\u2019 in particular. It seems there are also concerns in light of the key blockchain characteristic of openness, as coin-holders effectively act as gatekeepers. And from a practical standpoint, proof-of-stake systems are known to have multiple weaknesses and vectors of attacks. Vitalik promises everyone a miracle and we have to believe him. Well, maybe he will deliver. Maybe he won\u2019t. So, letting the new Ethereum play out all the risks associated with this transition first makes total sense.\u201d\nSince quitting the Ethereum development team, Hoskinson has set-up his own company. And within the company, developers have created a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm they believe works. Hoskinson, therefore, doesn\u2019t doubt the concept itself. But he does agree it\u2019s premature to roll out the mechanism as a consensus model on Ethereum Classic.\nInstead, he believes it may be a good governance tool:\n\u201cOne of the main challenges we face as a community, apart from a technical road map, is the establishment of a governance process. We no longer have a Vitalik, a benevolent dictator for life and I don\u2019t think anyone in the Ethereum Classic community would want that back. Luckily, there are ideas out there on how to better handle protocol forks. I think we can learn from altcoins, like Dash and Tezos. And indeed I believe proof-of-stake types of systems could be very useful in this regard.\u201d\nBitcoin Maximalists\nThat said, not everyone is equally excited about this newfound inspiration. While the heart of the Ethereum Classic community consists of eager participants, a contingent of the original supporters did consider the project to be a protest movement more than anything else. And some of these are slowly but surely losing interest, often to re-focus on Bitcoin.\nOne of the earliest community members and investors in Ethereum Classic after the hard fork goes by the pseudonyms \u201cSteve\u201d or \u201cMrHodl.\u201d The self-admitted \u201cBitcoin maximalist\u201d who\u2019d rather see the new Ethereum fail rather than Ethereum Classic succeed, would have preferred to see this project stick to the original plan.\n\u201cAt first I was excited about Ethereum Classic because there was no doubt in my mind that a market would form and develop around the original Ethereum chain,\u201d Steve said to Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cI was hoping that the vision of the Ethereum Foundation would live on, but with immutability. When I started to get the feeling that Ethereum Classic was going in a different direction, I simply lost interest and sold most of my classic ether. To me it became just another altcoin.\u201d\nHilliard, too, sees little real future potential in either version of Ethereum. While he thinks Ethereum Classic might have a slightly bigger chance on long-term success, the most likely scenario for him is that both will eventually wither.\n\u201cLong term, I think both the new Ethereum and Ethereum Classic will have a lot of difficulty with security due to immaturity of this area of computer science and the difficulty in writing provably correct code,\u201d Hilliard said. \u201cMaybe Ethereum Classic will have more security focus\u2026 but to be honest most of the top talent there works on Bitcoin. And it will likely be difficult to recruit top security experts that are capable doing proper code and architecture design. I find Turing-complete blockchains to be quite risky in general, but if there\u2019s any future in that domain it\u2019s probably in Bitcoin sidechains like Rootstock which appear to be putting security first.\u201d\nHoskinson published his own thoughts on an Ethereum Classic roadmap\u00a0here.", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 19}

More than $5 million worth of bitcoin were stolen in the theft. The good news was that, unlike Bitfinex, the vast majority of Bitstamp\u2019s funds were held in cold storage. Ironically, it was this hack that prompted Bitstamp to partner with BitGo for its multisig security offering.\nZupan also discussed other aspects of how his company\u2019s exchange is structured to reassure traders that its system is secure.\n\u201cAware that monitoring is crucial in the industry, we are the first virtual currency exchange to get formal oversight in place,\u201d he said. \u201cA key component of this is our recently acquired licence, which requires constant external financial audits, code reviews and penetration tests, examinations and the regular reporting of our financial balances. This provides the security our users require.\u201d\n\u201cIn our view, this unfortunate incident only serves to further confirm the importance of compliance, corporate governance, regulatory monitoring and auditing for virtual currency services,\u201d Zupan added. \u201cWe, of course, hope that this issue will be resolved quickly and with a positive outcome for Bitfinex and its customers.\u201d\nReasoning Behind Bitfinex\u2019s Storage Setup\nOne of the main questions being asked of Bitfinex in the aftermath of the hack is why it decided to eliminate the cold storage aspect of its storage setup. This question was at least partially answered by Bitfinex\u2019s Zane Tackett on the Whalepool Teamspeak server over the weekend.\n\u201cThere were a lot of reasons for why we went with this implementation with BitGo; one, a big one, was transparency,\u201d said Tackett. \u201cEveryone has their own wallet that they can watch on the blockchain. They can see their bitcoin at any time, and we settle it once per day.\u201d\nTackett argued that since Bitfinex offers such a high level of transparency, it is unable to cover things up when funds are lost or stolen. The details of how the exchange will secure its bitcoins in the future are unknown at this time.", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 8}

As a result, clients of Elliptic\u2019s blockchain intelligence service can obtain more meaningful insights by automatically screening Bitcoin entities for links to sanctions, enforcement, politically exposed persons, adverse media and state-owned companies, as well as \u201cexposing money launderers, human traffickers, terrorists and drug dealers who use Bitcoin to make dark web purchases.\u201d\n\u201cThe lack of financial transparency on Bitcoin entities continues to stymie the ubiquitous adoption of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies,\u201d notes a joint press release. \u201cThat reality, though, is soon to be short-lived.\u201d\nElliptic, a blockchain security and compliance company established in London in 2013, strives to be \u00a0\u201cthe global standard for blockchain intelligence\u201d by transferring the rigorous security and compliance standards of traditional finance to the world of digital currencies. \u201cWe identify illicit activity on the Bitcoin blockchain and provide actionable intelligence to financial institutions and law enforcement agencies.\u201d In July, for example, Elliptic and the Internet Watch Foundation announced a partnership to monitor and report Bitcoin transactions related to child pornography.\nLexisNexis Risk Solutions, part of RELX Group, combines cutting-edge technology, data and advanced analytics to provide information that helps customers across industries and government predict, assess and manage risk. It is used by one hundred of the top U.S. banks and the firm also works with eighty percent of U.S. federal agencies, assisting with regulatory compliance and mitigating business risk, such as identity fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion, International Business Times reports.\n\u201cThis alliance demonstrates how data, technology and analytics can be used in innovative ways to foster financial transparency from China to Germany to the U.S.,\u201d said Thomas C. Brown, senior vice president of U.S. Commercial Markets and Global Market Development at LexisNexis Risk Solutions.\n\u201cMore banks, Fintech startups, payments companies and eCommerce businesses can further consider the usefulness of the permissionless blockchain because as of today they are able to deploy best-of-breed money laundering screening against Bitcoin. As a result, the virtual currency potential evolves to a new level \u2014 from possible conduit for money laundering to trusted technology along the economic value chain.\u201d\nDetecting money laundering is complicated because, of course, those who engage in illicit activities put all sorts of smokescreens in place and often have enough money to spend on counter-detection measures. For example, according to data provided by Elliptic, the largest dark marketplaces facilitate more than $250 million in annual sales.\n\u201cFor the first time, Bitcoin companies can leverage bank-grade risk management practices to identify Bitcoin entities that appear on sanction and watch lists from around the world,\u201d said Dr. James Smith, Elliptic CEO and co-founder. \u201cHaving this enriched data set built natively into Elliptic\u2019s products takes Bitcoin AML and KYC controls to the next level.\u201d\nSmith added that leading Bitcoin companies globally are using Elliptic products to assess risk on more than $1 billion in Bitcoin transactions each month. \u201cBy integrating LexisNexis Risk Solutions\u2019 robust watchlist data, we are making it safe for a new wave of financial institutions to handle Bitcoin and bank Bitcoin companies,\u201d he said.\nIts new partnership with LexisNexis has created a service to bring bank-grade anti-money laundering (AML) controls to Bitcoin transactions, making the virtual currency more attractive to those who might want to use it for legitimate transactions, Reuters reports.\nAccording to both companies, Bitcoin operators need to demonstrate strict compliance with AML and KYC (know your customer) if they want to be taken seriously in the financial world at large, and therefore the new monitoring solution can help in mainstreaming the emerging distributed ledger economy. However, it\u2019s to be expected that those who want to escape detection \u2014 not always for illicit reasons \u2014 will increasingly resort to non-Bitcoin alternatives able to provide enhanced privacy.\nIn June 2015 Bitcoin Magazine covered the launch of \u201cThe Bitcoin Big Bang,\u201d an interactive visualization that plots the emergence and interconnectivity of the key players in Bitcoin since its genesis in 2009. It was described as a breakthrough in Bitcoin transaction monitoring and compliance. According to the company, monitoring and compliance services help digital currency businesses to gain credibility and establish good relations with banks and mainstream financial operators.\nOf course, operators such as Elliptic and Chainalysis, a Swiss company that provides similar services, are often criticized by parts of the Bitcoin community, especially libertarian early adopters. However, it seems likely that monitoring and compliance services are here to stay and grow.\nImage via Elliptic", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 5}

They understand that a public decentralized ledger like the blockchain is ideal for cataloging and storing original works of art, documents, manuscripts, photographs and images, away from any central authority.\nEven if the copyright service ceases to exist, there will still be a verifiable copy of an original work on the blockchain.\nAddison Cameron-Huff, a Toronto-based lawyer whose specialties include bitcoin and blockchain businesses and copyright infringement, told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cOne application for blockchains that I expect to see is a registry of ownership (history of assignments). It can be very difficult to trace the ownership chain for copyrighted works (especially with multiple authors, e.g. sound + video + text). Traceable ownership is a problem domain that blockchains are especially well suited for.\u201d\nBlockai uses the blockchain for writers and artists to timestamp their work, keep a \u201cvigilant eye\u201d out for anyone violating their copyright, create a permanent record of their work and issue their clients a time-stamped copyright certificate.\nEvery user has a profile on the site which allows them to file and organize all their certificates. Once uploaded, the service can track online usage of a client\u2019s work and alert them if there is any unauthorized usage.\nAs Blockai has noted:\n\n\u201cIt's obvious that the current copyright system in the United States is well behind the times in a digital age and doesn't provide nearly enough (affordable) resources for victims of theft, especially if you find yourself going up against a large and powerful group. As we wait for the slow wheels of bureaucracy to turn, Blockai hopes to be a useful and easy-to-use solution.\u201d\n\nIs Proof of Existence Enough?\nIn a phone interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Paul Horbal, a lawyer specializing in new technologies and patent protection, commented:\n\u201cBlockai aims to help establish a date of creation for copyright works but that is rarely a major issue. The much more pressing problem is removing infringing content and for that you will generally have to fall back on legal means.\u201d\nHorbal said that, despite Blockai\u2019s promises, ultimately the legal system has to be involved to protect against copyright infringement, however legal tools are available:\n\u201cIt is easier than ever before to identify copyright infringement that takes place online. Governments have provided the tools to stop infringement, such as the 'notice and takedown' system introduced with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in the U.S., or the \u2018notice and notice\u2019 system in Canada's Copyright Act.\u201d\n\"It is also possible to identify and stop copyright infringement in other parts of the world, and there are continuing efforts to modernize and harmonize copyright laws internationally,\" he added.\nAddison Cameron-Huff was not as enthusiastic about the chances of enforcing copyright protection. He told us:\n\u201cWhile I love the idea of a central registry of photos with copyright information, the reality of copyright is that it's at once global but also local. Copyright is governed by a patchwork of local laws that differ in sometimes important ways (e.g. copyright registration processes and differences in protections for certain types of works). Any startup entering this space will have to consider the laws of many jurisdictions.\n\u201cEven if a company succeeded in building a central registry for global copyright there would be many issues around who actually created the work (was it registered by the correct person?) and what happens next, once someone discovers that a registered work is being used without permission? Global copyright law will inform the usefulness of the global copyright repository,\u201d he added.\nIn an article entitled \u201cBuzzword Bingo: How Blockai Says the Blockchain Will Protect Your Copyright and Other Nonsense\u201d author Nate Hoffelder says Blockai and websites like it are \u201chooey\u201d and are simply selling the illusion of protection.\n\u201cBlockai says that they offer 'copyright monitoring that alerts you when people are using your work' when in reality, Blockai can't catch an image when used in a YouTube video or when it's shared via a social networks (which are encrypted).\u201d\n\u201cA hash of a work isn't the same as the work itself\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\nCameron-Huff notes that, from a technical point of view, there\u2019s an interesting question of when an image is not an image. He explained:\n\n\u201cAn additional challenge for someone seeking to make a blockchain for copyright is the hashing issue. A hash of a work isn't the same as the work itself and copyright is generally broader than just the specific arrangement of bits. Even a slightly modified work is likely to still be covered by the original work's copyright but the hash will be completely different. I think that's a challenge for anyone seeking to make a blockchain for images (or other digital goods).\u201d\n\nThere is no question that the blockchain is an ideal place to store claims to authorship without a central authority to censor, take down or potentially tamper with original work. Whether it can prevent copyright infringement is another question.", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 9}

During this \u201cBitcoin Hacker Residency,\u201d they will assist and mentor about half a dozen developers, with the goal of enabling them to contribute to Bitcoin on a protocol-level or to related projects such as\u00a0FIBRE or the Lightning Network.\nBitcoin\u2019s development community, and in particular the part of it that focuses on low-level protocol improvement, consists of a relatively small group of developers. Most of them work on Bitcoin Core, and they joined the project roughly between 2011 and 2013. Since then, not many newcomers have started contributing \u2014 with Morcos and Daftuar as some notable exceptions. Along with Corallo, they believe this is likely in part because the learning curve to contribute meaningfully has become quite steep.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Corallo explained:\n\u201cI think there is a lot of understandable feelings of not wanting to contribute to Bitcoin Core and protocol-level development because 'nothing in Bitcoin is new again.\u2019 When you come into Bitcoin as a developer, you're gonna first suggest the same 100 changes everyone else did the first year. And it doesn't usually feel great to be constantly told your ideas are not useful \u2014 especially when you're communicating over text, and you don\u2019t see that people are trying to help. You just see a bunch of people who keep telling you you're wrong.\u201d\nThe hacker residency is intended for established developers, preferably with experience in Bitcoin-related projects, who are not on a protocol-level competency yet. Corallo believes the month-long coding class should allow these developers to cross the gap and be able to contribute meaningfully to Bitcoin Core or related projects, if they want to.\n\u201cThere are a ton of Bitcoin developers who have never contributed to Bitcoin Core, or to low protocol development \u2014 lots of them because they feel ill-equipped to do so \u2014 for instance because the idea of going through rigorous review like we have to do sounds really daunting. So we're looking for those people to really learn how that works, and come to think about the issues that Bitcoin Core developers focus all day on,\u201d Corallo said.\nThe hacker residency will have a hands-on approach, where participating developers mostly learn by doing. The goal is to put developers in a supportive environment where they can contribute to Bitcoin Core or other Bitcoin-related projects, with people around to help them where necessary. Additionally, there will be a few talks about Bitcoin's design elements and ways to think about Bitcoin protocol engineering.\nThe hacker residency should not be considered a recruitment scheme, however; the class is offered entirely on a no-strings-attached basis. Participating in the hacker residency is free, but availability is limited. Developers interested in joining can apply by sending an overview of their background as well as some ideas of Bitcoin projects they find exciting to fall16residency@chaincode.com.\nImage source\u00a0https://www.flickr.com/photos/qwrrty/3446221502/", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 8}

In particular, Credits is the first blockchain platform provider with an offering exclusively for the U.K. public sector.\nG-Cloud 8 is the current iteration of G-Cloud, an initiative of the U.K. government targeted at easing procurement by public-sector bodies of information technology services that use cloud computing.\nThe program, managed by the Crown Commercial Service, contains two key elements: It includes framework agreements with suppliers, from which public sector organizations can buy services without needing to run a full tender or competition procurement process; and it operates an online \"Digital Marketplace\" where public sector bodies can search for services that are covered by the G-Cloud framework agreements.\nThe G-Cloud framework agreement will allow organizations across the U.K. public sector, including central and local governments, the devolved administrations, health, education, emergency services, defense, and not-for-profits such as housing associations and charities, to use the Credits Blockchain platform-as-a-service (PaaS) without having to go through the time-consuming formalities of the standard public procurement process. Therefore, public bodies in the U.K. are more motivated to use the Credits Blockchain PaaS, which is now officially endorsed by the U.K. government.\n\u201cG-Cloud and the Digital Marketplace allow for a much more streamlined procurement process and represents a significant advance in the ability for smaller technology providers to sell into government, and, conversely, for government agencies to have greater access to technology to deliver better service to constituents in a more cost-effective manner,\u201d Nick Williamson, co-founder and CEO of Credits, told Bitcoin Magazine, adding that approximately 80 percent of the companies selling on the Digital Marketplace are SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises).\nG-Cloud is not only intended to stimulate (or in blunter terms, subsidize) emerging technology sectors and companies, but the products and services offered under the pro[gram\u2019s framework agreements are meant to be actually used by public bodies in the U.K. In fact, Credits is already working with potential users.\nThe Credits framework and tools enable enterprises, government and the public sector to build robust blockchains that address the challenges in establishing provenance, authentication and reconciliation. According to the company, the Credits framework is designed to be seamlessly and securely interoperable with legacy and other blockchain systems.\n\u201cWe're in early talks with various government agencies on several initial use cases,\u201d said Williamson. \u201cWe're engaging both directly with the agencies themselves but also through solutions partners who have experience building traditional technology for the public sector. These use cases range from using blockchain technology to more robustly manage data access and integrity to managing and authenticating identity to more robust regulatory reporting.\u201d\nIn 2015, Bitcoin Magazine reported that the Isle of Man, where Credits is based, wants to become a leading Bitcoin hub, and interviewed Brian Donegan, head of operations for Digital Development and eBusiness at the Isle of Man Department of Economic Development. Donegan confirmed that the island is gearing up to become the ideal environment for digital financial technology businesses, entrepreneurs and developers.\n\u201cThe Isle of Man is a world-leading FinTech and blockchain hub, and we are pleased to add Credits to a list of successful digital businesses that have established operations on the Island,\u201d said Donegan about the G-Cloud framework agreement.\n\u201cThe Isle of Man is a fantastic home for our headquarters, and the IoM Government is one of our best supporters,\u201d Williamson told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThe work we have done with them laid the groundwork for our continued foray into utilizing blockchain technology to enable the public sector, and they are an instrumental part of our success.\u201d\nIn January, Bitcoin Magazine covered a new report produced by the U.K. Government Office for Science and edited by Sir Mark Walport, chief scientific adviser. The report looked at the future of distributed ledger technology and advocated the deployment of blockchain solutions for a variety of public services. This and other recent initiatives of the U.K. government and central bank show that the country could be gearing up to replicate, on a larger scale, the initiative of the Isle of Man, and become a major blockchain hub.\n\u201cThe U.K. is absolutely leading the way in blockchain in the public sector at this time,\u201d said Williamson. \u201cFrom the report published earlier this year by Sir Mark Walport to the projects being explored by entities by the DWP [Department for Work and Pensions], the U.K. government is being extremely proactive at a critical time in this fledgling industry.\u201d\nIt makes sense to speculate about the impact Brexit could have on the U.K.\u2019s ambitions to lead distributed ledger technology in the region, as well as on U.K. blockchain companies. As long as Credits\u2019s main business is in the U.K., the company should be relatively safe from negative impacts.\n\u201cWe don't anticipate our business being directly materially affected by the E.U. referendum,\u201d said Williamson. \u201cAs a software provider (as opposed to a financial services company), we are not reliant on things such as the ability to passport licenses in order to operate. However, raising money may be marginally harder in the short run due to heightened uncertainty.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 8}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nRoss Ulbricht\u2019s legal defense filed a reply to the government as part of his appeal this week. On behalf of Ulbricht, who was sentenced to double life in prison without parole for operating the Silk Road dark marketplace under the alias Dread Pirate Roberts (DPR) more than a year ago, attorney Joshua Dratel disputes the fairness of the trial. The defense has requested that Ulbricht\u2019s \u201cconvictions should be vacated, and a new trial ordered, or that he be re-sentenced before a different district judge.\u201d\nUlbricht's defense had issued an initial appeal earlier this year, which was answered by state prosecutors in late May. This week, the defense responded to these answers in a\u00a0brief submitted to the appellate court, hoping to prove \u2014 most importantly \u2014 that Ulbricht's Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated.\nTo learn more about the appeal, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Ulbricht's mother, Lyn Ulbricht, who's been fighting for her son's rights ever since he was arrested in October of 2013.\nRight to a Fair Trial\nThe overriding issue in the appeal is Ulbricht's right to a fair trial and right to present a defense, as established by the Fifth and Sixth amendments to the United States Constitution. Ulbricht's defense maintains that these rights were denied to Ulbricht. Most importantly \u2014 but not exclusively \u2014 as evidence pertaining to corrupt agents involved in the case was not allowed to be brought forth in court.\nThis evidence, most importantly concerns special agents Carl Mark Force IV and Shawn Bridges, both of whom confessed to corruption and are currently serving time in prison. State prosecutors were aware of both these cases at the time of Ulbricht's trial. One of them was also known to the Ulbricht defense at the time, while the other was not \u2014 a deliberate non-disclosure, according to Ulbricht's defense.\nAs such, the court denied Ulbricht's defense the opportunity to inform the jury about both corrupt agents along with all related information potentially relevant to the case, which Ulbricht\u2019s defense maintains is illegal as per the Brady Rule.\nLyn Ulbricht explained:\n\u201cA person in trial has to be convicted beyond a reasonable doubt. If this evidence was allowed to be presented, it's a question in my mind whether the jury wouldn't have had some doubt about Ross's role. Ross's lawyer thought to have one of the corrupt agents in the trial but the government said that would jeopardize their investigation into this corruption and claimed it's a separate case that has nothing to do with Ross. However, going through the documentation, Ross himself found that he was effectively arrested by [Special Agent] Force; Force was very much involved with the investigation. Of course, that information would have been very relevant.\u201d\nThe information pertaining to the corrupt agents is not the only information that was withheld from the jury. Most importantly, Ulbricht's defense maintains that while Ulbricht did establish the website, he did not operate it for most of its existence; rather, there were several DPRs. In a bombshell revelation at the time of the trial, it was revealed that state prosecutors suspected at least one other high-profile name to operate under the alias: former Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles. Although questioning regarding the potential involvement of Karpeles was initially allowed in court, it was deemed irrelevant by the sitting judge later on in the trial.\nFourth Amendment Violation\nUlbricht's defense also argues that his Fourth Amendment rights were breached, claiming state agencies did not have the proper warrants to investigate Ulbricht in the manner that they did.\nThe most important breach, according to the defense, regards Ulbricht's digital property rights. Prosecutors used general warrants to search through Ulbricht's entire laptop as well as Facebook and Google accounts. The legality of this practice is questionable, as it lacked particularity and has, therefore even drawn attention from civil rights groups.\n\u201cThe National Association for Criminal Defense Lawyers and the EFF [Electronic Frontier Foundation] both have joined the brief, saying these warrants were illegal,\u201d Lyn Ulbricht explained. \u201cGeneral warrants mean that the government can go through your home, from attic to basement, looking for whatever they can find; rummaging around. In this case they rummaged around Ross's digital house. But the Fourth Amendment requires particularity. It requires these agents to say exactly what they're looking for.\u201d\nThere is also a question regarding validity of digital evidence in itself, which includes most of the evidence that was used to convict Ulbricht. Since the corrupt agents had log-in credentials and access to many parts of the Silk Road backend, chat logs and other material may have easily been fabricated or edited, the defense claims. This is especially relevant since it's clear now that Bridges, in particular, took deliberate affirmative steps to deflect blame from himself onto others.\nState agents also applied advanced techniques to wiretap and geolocate Ulbricht in order to arrest him. Much like applying these techniques to mobile phones, the defense argues this was unlawful, too, without very specific and required warrants.\nUnreasonable Sentencing\nAs another key main point, Ulbricht's defense argues that the sentencing was \u201cshockingly high\u201d and exceeds the bounds of reasonableness. The double life sentence Ulbricht is currently serving, his lawyer points out, \u201cdwarfs the sentences imposed on other key players\u201d and \u201cfar exceeds even the sentence requested by the government.\u201d\nUlbricht's defense specifically argues that the basis on which he received the severe sentencing was shoehorned in by the judge, particularly as it relies on a couple of drug overdose-related deaths. According to experts, however, it cannot be established that these overdoses were caused by drugs purchased on the Silk Road website at all.\nAccording to Lyn Ulbricht:\n\u201cAt the trial there were six overdose stats; claims that people died from drugs they bought on Silk Road. A 30-year experienced pathologist said there's no way you can say these drugs came from Silk Road. Yet the judge relied on this for her sentencing, basically creating her own legal standards.\u201d\nAdditionally, the judge set out to make an example of Ulbricht, which has no basis in law. Such a deterrence penalty, moreover, has proved to be altogether ineffective, as dark net markets have only grown in number, size and scope since Ulbricht's conviction.\nLikewise, the judge took into account an alleged murder-for-hire plot, supposedly paid for by Ulbricht to protect Silk Road customer identities. These murders, however, were not only never actually carried out, they were not part of the case against Ulbricht. As such, his defense maintains that these murders-for-hire remain unproven in the court of law and should not weigh into the sentencing.\nFurthermore, the defense claims that Ulbricht's heavy sentencing was ultimately the result on the judge's assessment that Ulbricht would pose a risk to society if he ever got out of prison. This assessment is completely unwarranted, Lyn Ulbricht believes.\n\u201cWith this sentence, there's a precedent set for a non-violent person, who's a first offender, with no evidence at all that he is a danger to anyone \u2014 certainly after the mandatory memo of 20 years that he would come out at the age of 50, with no internet access and be a danger on the internet,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he's certainly been shown not to be any sort of danger off the internet \u2026 it's so over the top. They made it clear they were just using him to set an example.\n\u201cSome people think Ross is a villain. Some people think Ross is a hero.

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nAlthough a large proportion of the Ethereum community believed the recent hard fork would result in one chain that the entire community could get behind, it\u2019s clear that a segment of Ethereum enthusiasts would like to see a strict adherence to the original concept of code as law.\nEthereum Classic is the original Ethereum blockchain that does not include a patch to reassign misallocated funds back to DAO token holders who had a large portion of their ether stash drained by an attacker who found a flaw in The DAO\u2019s source code.\nEver since Poloniex listed the Ethereum Classic coin on their exchange, the market has responded by breathing new life into the original chain. There is now a debate among both communities as to which chain should be used going forward, while others believe both chains should be allowed to grow and prosper.\nOn a recent live edition of Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin held on August 4 and mediated by Andreas Antonopoulos, Stephanie Murphy and Adam Levine, Gnosis founder Martin K\u00f6ppelmann debated Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson on the merits of Ethereum Classic. Anthony Di Iorio, another Ethereum co-founder, CEO of Decentral and chief digital officer at the Toronto Stock Exchange, also provided his own nuanced opinions on the matter from a business perspective.\nThe Case for the Hard-Forked Ethereum\nFor K\u00f6ppelmann, the decision to go with the hard-forked version of the Ethereum blockchain is a practical one. In his view, it is rational for people like Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin to stay with the more popular blockchain because these systems need big enough communities to have value.\n\u201cI see, at this point, huge benefits of having one community,\u201d K\u00f6ppelmann said during the debate. \u201cEthereum is about network effects. It\u2019s about having all those [decentralized applications] that work well together because they\u2019re on the same world computer, the Ethereum network.\n\u201cCurrently, we only have those network effects if [everyone] is on the same chain,\u201d K\u00f6ppelmann added.\nThe Gnosis founder also noted that it may be useful to have Ethereum applications work across chains in the future but he still thinks it\u2019s best to focus on one chain for now.\nWhile Ethereum Classic has attained more than 20 percent of the Ethereum hashrate at this point, K\u00f6ppelmann explained that developers do not move to other blockchains so easily. \u201cI\u2019m not looking at short-term price swings,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m in for the long game and building stuff and that will happen on ETH, as far as I can see.\u201d\nIn K\u00f6ppelmann\u2019s view, it\u2019s a better option to stick with one chain while the two networks are so similar. \u201cOf those who were building stuff on Ethereum, most will continue building stuff on Ethereum,\u201d he added.\nThe Case for Ethereum Classic\nDuring the debate, Hoskinson took the side of Ethereum Classic. He argued that the recent hard fork angered a segment of the Ethereum community and he was also angered, even though he left the project in the summer of 2014.\n\u201cWhat initially attracted me to Ethereum was the social contract of having this world computer where the code is basically law \u2014 it runs as written,\u201d said Hoskinson. \u201cA lot of people were really excited about that kind of a prospect.\u201d\nHoskinson noted that Ethereum is an expensive, inefficient world computer that is mostly useful in specific situations. His description of Ethereum is comparable to Bitcoin\u2019s usefulness as a censorship-resistant payment method. \u201cThe saving grace of the system has always been that you can write code that, regardless of who it\u2019s inconvenient to or the consequences of that code, you have a safe place where you\u2019re able to run that code without fear of censorship,\u201d Hoskinson explained. \u201cThat was the initial social contract; that\u2019s what I signed up for.\u201d\nHoskinson added that it\u2019s a bit premature to declare which chain will be used by the top developers for their decentralized applications over the long run. He also said miners may have a soft spot for Ethereum Classic because the hard-forked version of the blockchain will eventually move to a proof-of-stake system. Hoskinson also questioned whether it will even matter what chain a developer likes the most in the future:\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably going to be some effort to start talking about cross-deployment, much like we do with PhoneGap. We use PhoneGap to deploy on multiple ecosystems. I think a lot of people are going to start building tools to deploy on Rootstock as well as Ethereum. It would make no sense to just omit Ethereum Classic, especially if these systems are fairly similar to each other \u2014 as they are right now.\u201d\nRootstock is an Ethereum-esque platform being developed by RSK Labs as a sidechain to Bitcoin.\nIn response to K\u00f6ppelmann\u2019s view that most developers are going with the hard-forked chain, Hoskinson stated, \u201c[Developers] are coming [to Ethereum Classic]. I\u2019m hiring three full-time developers myself. I have many cryptographers and good developers working for me. ... We will have developers within our space very soon. We already have a lot of volunteer developers within our Slack.\u201d\nEthereum Classic: Here to Stay?\nAlthough Ethereum Classic was nearly dead before being listed on Poloniex, it now appears that the network will have some staying power as a version of Ethereum with a different social contract than that of the hard-forked chain. Bringing a business perspective to the table, Di lorio noted that he\u2019s just going to react to what his customers want. \u201cAs a business owner, I have to look at both sides,\u201d he stated. \u201cPeople say you have to pick one side or the other and I just don\u2019t believe that.\u201d\n\u201cFor me, I\u2019m going to make decisions and speak as a business owner who\u2019s a blockchain company,\u201d Di lorio continued. \u201cI\u2019m not an Ethereum company; I\u2019m not a Bitcoin company. We\u2019re supporting Bitcoin; we\u2019re supporting Ethereum. We\u2019ve got Dash coming in next week; we\u2019re going to support them all and let people make their choices.\u201d\nAs Hoskinson noted, Ethereum Classic has its own developers and tools that allow developers to release their decentralized applications on any platform and may soon be available. For now, it seems there will be three major networks in the smart contract space: Ethereum, Ethereum Classic and Rootstock. \u201cIf one keeps going strong and the other [withers] away, OK \u2014 that\u2019s fine,\u201d said Di lorio. \u201cWe\u2019re going to support what our customers want.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 5}

This partnership gives gamers the ability to plant and hunt for bitcoin treasures across the globe, utilizing IndieSquare\u2019s API.\nBased in Tokyo, IndieSquare provides developers with digital token management features saving them the task of running and maintaining their own Bitcoin and Counterparty systems. This, in turn, means that developers can focus their efforts on game play. For players, it means that they can securely store, use and send their blockchain assets via their mobile devices.\nIn an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, co-founder of IndieSquare, Koji Higashi, said, \u201cApplication of blockchain technology in the gaming industry may very well be the first real reason for regular people to get excited about the tech and push wider adoption of bitcoin as well.\u201d\nHigashi said that IndieSquare has the most popular mobile token wallet in the world with an active user-base. \u201cAs more applications are built upon IndieSquare, connecting other interesting apps such as Takara will be easy and will provide further utility to your own service.\u201d\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Moss said that using Counterparty tokens within Takara was the start of digital property rather than virtual assets being tied to a single use case.\n\u201cI was interested in the idea of users collecting and geocaching tokenized game items,\u201d Moss said. \u201cCurrently Spells of Genesis and a few other projects are using Counterparty tokens as game items, so it seemed like a good fit compared to other protocols such as Colored Coins.\u201d\nDirector of the Counterparty Foundation, Trevor Altpeter, told Bitcoin Magazine that in-game assets present the opportunity to create advanced video game economies containing value that is fungible in the real world.\n\u201cThis concept has already been demonstrated through features like World of Warcraft Gold and Counter Strike [where] Global Offensive skins are being used as value stores in their respective game economies.\u201d\nHe added that Counterparty assets are an improvement over the existing model, offering enhanced functionality, while also reducing counterparty risk inherent to the current centralized custody of these assets that ultimately limits their utility and value in the real world. The Counterparty tokens in Takara can be used for coupons, tickets, loyalty points, company stocks or even game items.\nFor the teams involved, the functional decentralized exchange that Counterparty offers was the key differentiator compared to similar protocols. It is the decentralized exchange itself that would, essentially, draw more people toward the blockchain technology giving users more exciting interaction, making the concept of it more attractive.\nPopularity of the Gaming Industry\nAccording to the\u00a0Entertainment Software Association (ESA) over 150 million Americans play video games. Approximately 63 percent of homes have a least one person playing video games on a regular basis or at least three hours per week.\nWhen it comes to the monetary value of the gaming industry, the ESA reports that in 2014 the gaming industry sold more than 135 million games, generating $22 billion in revenue.\nUnsurprisingly, video games are a strong contender for economic growth.\nOf course, with more people using their phones to download and play games, consumers are becoming more interested in games that aren\u2019t your run-of-the-mill casino, dice or gambling games. Games that are challenging and provide rewards are more interesting, which is why games such as Spells of Genesis, Takara, Game of Birds and Sarutobi are becoming increasingly popular.\nIs Crypto too Complex?\nMoss said that while it\u2019s interesting to explore a new space with the potential for innovative games, he thinks that for regular users grasping the potential of crypto may be a little too complex for them.\n\u201cAt the moment, most games are gambling dice games with the emphasis being on the financial rewards rather than innovative gameplay,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, with Counterparty and tokenized game items I hope this will allow the development of crypto games that are not just about winning bitcoin but rather collecting value and wealth through blockchain assets and game items.\u201d\nThe popularity of PokemonGo, for example, is a clear indication that people are interested in innovative gameplay that involves gamers with their surroundings. Takara, in fact, is similar to PokemonGo, but instead of users collecting Pokemon they are finding bitcoins and various tokens.\nHigashi suggested that adding bitcoin to PokemonGo would have the potential to boost the adoption rate of bitcoin to the wider community.\n\u201cIf we can somehow insert blockchain into the equation, say being able to trade their Pokemon securely on the blockchain with other players, that alone can easily be a killer app for bitcoin.\u201d\nCurrently, however, there aren\u2019t many games that implement crypto in them. Nevertheless, with the release of IndieSquare\u2019s API and SDK tools it will be easier for other creators to include crypto into their products.\n\u201cI predict as a game like Spells of Genesis becomes popular, other games will implement the use of SoG cards in their own games in order to attract SoG\u2019s user base,\u201d said Moss. \u201cThis ripple effect of sharing game items for users will incentivize other game development in their space.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 9}

It is widely felt that in order to challenge traditional payment networks and assume a key role in the decentralized future of the internet, blockchains must find ways to radically improve their throughput, measured in number of transactions per second.\n\u201cToday\u2019s representative blockchain such as Bitcoin takes 10 min or longer to confirm transactions, achieves 7 transactions/sec maximum throughput,\u201d note the authors of a recent research paper titled \"On Scaling Decentralized Blockchains,\" presented at the Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2016 conference. \u201cIn comparison, a mainstream payment processor such as Visa credit card confirms a transaction within seconds and processes 2000 transactions/sec on average, with a peak rate of 56,000 transactions/sec.\u201d\nOn the Bitcoin blockchain, lightning networks offer a promising approach to Bitcoin scalability, enabling the Bitcoin system to process transactions at a high rate and low cost, thereby positioning themselves as suitable alternatives to existing payment networks. Now, a similar counterpart is set to emerge on the Ethereum blockchain: the Raiden network.\nIn a lightning network, related transactions take place almost instantly on off-chain \u201cmicropayment channels\u201d and only the final settlement is processed by the blockchain. While there are interesting preliminary implementations, the adoption of lightning networks in Bitcoin is likely to take some time because it requires appropriate tweaks to the Bitcoin Core platform.\nBut Bitcoin is not the only blockchain in town. Ethereum, an alternative blockchain technology framework which offers higher flexibility and programmability for smart contracts, is gaining momentum at an impressive rate, despite momentary setbacks like the recent drama around The DAO.\nRecently R3 commissioned Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin to write a report on Ethereum\u2019s design, upcoming technical developments and applications in private systems. Buterin\u2019s 44-page report gives a detailed overview of Ethereum\u2019s overall architecture and technical design, current status and development roadmap.\nIn a commentary on Buterin\u2019s paper, R3 Senior Strategy Associate Kathleen Breitman noted that scalability is a key outstanding question for distributed ledger solutions in capital markets; blockchain technologies are, by orders of magnitude, still very much behind the transaction throughput of mainstream financial networks.\nButerin\u2019s roadmap for Ethereum recognizes and addresses the importance of scalability. In particular, state channels \u2014 a generalization of the lightning network concept in Bitcoin \u2014 would permit conducting most transactions off-chain between parties directly, using the blockchain only as a kind of final arbiter in case of disputes.\nThe Raiden Network is one of the first implementations of state channels for Ethereum blockchains. In a first proof of concept, Raiden tokens were exchanged between nodes with the opening, closing and settlement of channels taking place on the Ethereum testnet, while the actual transfers happened off-chain, International Business Times reports. The Raiden Network reduces data traffic on the blockchain by combining thousands or even millions of transactions into a single on-blockchain transaction. This reduction could place the throughput of mainstream payment networks such as Visa within reach, as well as opening up possibilities for internet of things (IoT) applications or micropayments for web-based content.\nAccording to Heiko Hees, CEO of Brainbot Technologies and creator of Raiden, Ethereum is better suited to Lightning-like payment channels than Bitcoin. \u201cIn Bitcoin the scripting language is rather limited so it's way more complicated to set it up,\u201d said Hees. \u201cSetting this up on Ethereum is straightforward; any developer can easily understand the smart contract involved. The other difference is that until Bitcoin implements Segregated Witness to fix the transaction malleability issue, they cannot do Lightning.\"\nAccording to the Raiden website, the new technology permits leveraging off-chain state networks to extend Ethereum with scalability to more than 1,000,000 transfers per second, near-instant transactions with very low fees, confidentiality, interoperability with other Ethereum applications and support for micropayments.\nInstead of sending all transactions immediately to the blockchain (which is the main scalability bottleneck), the Raiden Network lets users privately exchange signed transfer agreements and secure deposits. Raiden nodes, implemented as an extension to Ethereum with a simple API, talk to each other for off-chain transfers and use the Ethereum blockchain to manage deposits and settlements.\nHees hopes to demonstrate, perhaps in only a few weeks, that the Raiden Network can scale to as much as 100,000 transactions per second. Since the system can allow transactions as small as a millionth of a dollar, Hees hopes that it will find applications for the IoT, as well as for machine-to-machine and application-to-API transactions.\nCurrently under development, Raiden expects to release the alpha version in Q3 of 2016.", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 12}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nLast week\u2019s Bitfinex hack, in which Bitcoin\u2019s leading exchange lost almost 120,000 bitcoins valued some $70 million USD at the time, represented a depressing realization for the Bitcoin community. Where many had hoped that multi-million dollar hacks and loss of customers funds were a thing of the past, it became clear that storing bitcoins on an exchange is still not as secure as it perhaps should be. In an industry first, Bitfinex imposed an Extraordinary Loss Adjustment on all customer funds; re-opening balances this week show a cut of about 36 percent per account.\nBut the hack also served as another wake-up call. Moving forward, several technical solutions are being proposed to increase security of Bitcoin exchanges, to hopefully prevent similar scenario\u2019s in the future.\nHere is a brief overview of some of these possible solutions.\nMultisig\nAs of yet, it\u2019s not exactly clear what caused the Bitfinex hack. What is clear, is that a multi-signature set-up with BitGo to secure customer funds failed to provide any meaningful security. In theory, both Bitfinex and BitGo\u2019s servers should have needed to be compromised in order to steal any money. But in practice, BitGo seems to have co-signed any and all transactions requested by Bitfinex (or its hacker), offering no added security at all.\nAs a bittersweet gain from the Bitfinex fiasco, Bitcoin exchanges will hopefully not make this mistake again. As pointed out by several prominent exchanges already \u2014 including\u00a0Bitstamp and\u00a0BitMEX \u2014 multisig security can offer benefits. But it must, at the very least, be combined with other stopgaps, such as withdrawal limits and cold storage solutions.\nTime-locks\nThere are perhaps more interesting solutions on the horizon as well. Bitcoin\u2019s programmability in particular may allow for novel solutions to prevent or revert thefts even after they have happened.\nThis can be accomplished along several, slightly different strategies.\u00a0Timechains was an early proposal by Matthew Roberts and El\u00edas Sn\u00e6r Einarsson, while Cornell University researchers Malte M\u00f6ser, Ittay Eyal and Emin G\u00fcn Sirer very recently proposed \u201cBitcoin Vaults\u201d.\nBitcoin Vaults in particular could become a native part of the Bitcoin protocol. To explain it in slightly-imprecise-but-easy-to-understand-language, Bitcoin Vaults are special Bitcoin addresses that lock bitcoins up along a two-step security mechanism, with two different keys. Unlocking the bitcoins would require a typical private key, much like any other Bitcoin address. But after the initial lock has been opened, it would take, say, 24 hours before the bitcoins can actually be spent. And within these 24 hours, the transaction can be reverted with a backup key, ensuring a hacker wouldn\u2019t get the money. And if the hacker gains access to both keys, the exchange could still choose to \u201cburn\u201d all funds, thereby ensuring no one gets any money, thus disincentivizing theft in the first place.\n(Also see\u00a0this Development Mailing List thread for more discussion on these types of solutions.)\nPayment Channels\nAnother\u00a0idea and a solution that would require no changes to the Bitcoin protocol at all is for exchanges to set up payment channels with their customers. Much like a Lightning Network hub, the exchange would merely serve as a routing agent in between all users of the exchange, with no access to customer funds.\nInstead, all users would retain full control over any bitcoins they \u201cdeposited\u201d in the exchange. They would be able to withdraw their balance at any time, even if the exchange is hacked. Trading itself would require users to sign off on transactions, but since it would be off-blockchain transactions, this could happen as swiftly as centralized exchanges allow right now.\nIt should be noted, however, that this set-up would not improve security from the perspective of the exchange itself \u2014 it would arguably even make it worse in some ways. This is because the exchange would have to open payment channels with all customers, meaning they\u2019d need to invest bitcoins in these channels. A security breach, then, may still cost the exchange significant amounts of funds.\nDecentralization\nPerhaps the most robust solution would be to entirely decentralize exchanges in such a way that no company holds any bitcoins (or fiat currency) at all; ensuring there is no single point of failure.\nWhile there have been prior experiments in this domain \u2014 like\u00a0Coinffeine \u2014 only one decentralized exchange has gained some level of traction so far:\u00a0Bitsquare. Bitsquare is still very much a work in progress (the project only launched several months ago), and some aspects are not yet entirely decentralized; like the arbitration process. But it does offer the Bitcoin community a working, usable and useful decentralized exchange \u2014 with no company wallet to be hacked into whatsoever.\nAs a downside of Bitsquare, its usability is currently not quite as slick as offered by centralized exchanges. The process of making and taking offers is still somewhat clunky, and where bank transfers are used, settlement is slow. Furthermore, in order to prevent fraud, trading limits are lower than typical exchanges: around one or two bitcoins depending on the type of trade. And options for advanced trading strategies \u2014 leveraged trading, short selling and the rest \u2014 are not available.\nThat said, as argued by Bitsquare developer Manfred Karrer himself in a recent\u00a0blog post, \u201cThere is probably much room for improvement as long as the community focuses on the right problems to solve.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 9}

Bitcoin Magazine reported that in 2015 the WEF predicted that blockchain technology was one of the 21 changes in technological transformations and that the tipping point for its adoption would be in 2025.\nA year later, World Economic Forum repeated that \u201cvirtual currencies and their underlying technologies can provide faster and cheaper financial services and can become a powerful tool for deepening financial inclusion in the developing world.\u201d\nIn this latest report, the WEF concluded that blockchain technology could have impressive ramifications but would need the collaboration of government and technological experts to succeed.\nIt took a year for the World Economic Forum (WEF) to research how blockchain technology could help nine financial sectors, which included global payment and foreign trading. More than 200 innovators, subject matter experts and executives from prominent institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase, Visa and MasterCard, contributed their opinions. The results was assembled in this latest report.\u00a0These are some ifs most significant conclusions:\nBlockchain helps by being transparent and effective\n\n\u201cDistributed ledger technology (blockchain) has the potential to drive simplicity and efficiency by establishing new financial services infrastructure and processes\u201d (p.19).\n\nThe blockchain ledger can be proven enormously useful to banks and financial institutions by providing them with an unprecedented layer of transparency and trust. The operational transparency of DLT will cut down, if not eliminate, the number of disputes, minimize frauds and ensure that obligations and settlements are met. The ledger could also give companies a more secure, effective way of moving money and tracking transactions. Regulators could employ real-time monitoring of transactions, while operations could better source liquidity of assets and move money between accounts.\nBlockchain merges with other transformative technologies\n\n\u201cDistributed ledger technology will form the foundation of next generation financial services infrastructure in conjunction with other existing and emerging technologies\u201d (p.20)\n\nOver the last 50 years, a number of emerging technologies have merged to transform the financial services industry of the future. These include biometrics, cloud computing, cognitive computing, quantum analytics, predictive analytics and robotics. Distributed ledger technology is one of these but the WEF cautions that blockchain should be seen as \u201cpart of the toolbox\u201d rather than a panacea. Each industry, too, would use DLT in its own ways and for its own means, so for instance, the trading sector will likely use the ledger for real-time tracking and efficacy while payers that deal with global payments will use DLT for, among other reasons, preventing friction.\nBlockchain is revolutionary\n\n\u201cSimilar to technological advances in the past, new financial services infrastructure will transform and question traditional orthodoxies in today\u2019s business models\u201d (p.24)\n\nBlockchain upends all aspects of the traditional financial services sector from standard accounting habits to lending practices. Blockchain provides its own distributed, transparent record-keeping, leverages real-time trust among market participants and balances the information flow between lenders and borrowers. It also boosts dispute resolution since it provides regulators and regulated entities with a common transparent ledger. Finally, DLT reduces the need for intermediaries because of its shared and trusted environment.\nBlockchain needs collaboration to succeed\n\n\u201cThe most impactful distributed ledger technology applications will require deep collaboration between incumbents, innovators and regulators, adding complexity and delaying implementation\u201d (p.23)\n\nThe World Economic Forum cautions that \u201cupdating financial infrastructure through DLT will require significant time and investment.\u201d The three imperatives are: Resolving security issues, aligning competing interests and imposing a legal, regulatory and governance framework. This sounds easier than stated since divergent company interests are involved. If, and once achieved, this would provide DLT with a standardized system and superior efficacy that would boost the financial success of all nine sectors.\nLooking ahead\nTo date, more than 24 countries and 90 corporations use blockchain technology with many more expressing interest. The WEF notes that large banks around the world, including more than 90 central banks, have developed blockchain groups that hail its potential impact and study how to harness its technology. In fact, the report predicted that a full 80% of these banks could launch their own blockchains by 2017. Blockchain technology has \u201ccaptured the imagination and wallets of the financial services ecosystem\u201d but the WEF concluded that DLT has to resolve critical issues moving forward. These include: How to develop a roadmap to achieve market collaboration and standardized regulation, how to structure a regulated tax framework and how to implement a cost-benefit analysis to determine the financial viability of distributed ledger technology.", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 16}

This allows the system to be entirely trustless and decentralized, but also presents significant drawbacks. Privacy and fungibility are at odds, because public transactions allow anyone to trace the flow of bitcoins over the blockchain. Meanwhile, verifying a growing number of transactions adds to the cost of running a node, which could be a centralizing force.\nBut perhaps these drawbacks can be tackled.

His proposal \u201cMimblewimble\u201d \u2014 a reference to a Harry Potter spell \u2014 presents a radical slimming-down of the Bitcoin protocol that could not only dramatically increase privacy and fungibility, but also present significantly more scalability than Bitcoin\u2019s current blockchain architecture.\nMimblewimble may just hit two giant birds with one stone. Here\u2019s how.\nHiding Amounts\nMimblewimble is based on some of Bitcoin\u2019s familiar privacy features. One of these is Confidential Transactions, which was mostly developed by Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developer Gregory Maxwell and is currently deployed on Blockstream\u2019s Elements Alpha sidechain.\nConfidential Transactions lets senders encrypt the bitcoin amounts in transactions with random strings of numbers called \u201cblinding factors.\u201d This process works because transactions also include information with which (only) receivers can decrypt the amounts. And, by utilizing a cryptographic trick called the Pedersen Commitment, anyone else can still perform math on the encrypted amounts. Specifically, Bitcoin nodes can subtract the encrypted amounts on the sending side of transactions (\u201cinputs\u201d) from the encrypted amounts on the receiving side of transactions (\u201coutputs\u201d). If the two sides cancel out to zero, it means the combined inputs and the combined outputs are equal, and no bitcoins were created out of thin air.\nMimblewimble sort of turns this trick on its head as the receiver of a transaction generates the blinding factor. This is important because as one of the main deviations from the current Bitcoin protocol, this blinding factor is effectively used to prove ownership of the (blinded) bitcoins \u2014 private keys are no longer in play at all. (Nor are public keys or addresses.)\nProving ownership of the blinding factor itself revolves around a series of cryptographic tricks that are Mimblewimble\u2019s closest equivalent to Bitcoin\u2019s cryptographic signatures, though the full extent of these tricks is beyond the scope of this article.\nIt is important to note, however, that part of these mathematical maneuvers includes the introduction of a sort of \u201cdummy output.\u201d Where transaction outputs normally indicate under what conditions the receiver of a transaction may later spend the bitcoins, these dummy outputs are really just random numbers to ensure that only the person who generated the blinding factor can spend the bitcoins in the real outputs.\nCombining Transactions\nAnother familiar Bitcoin trick that inspired Mimblewimble is CoinJoin, first proposed by (again) Maxwell.\nCoinJoin allows users to bundle their transactions into one bigger transaction, scrambling all inputs (the \u201cfrom\u201d part of a transaction), as well as all outputs (the \u201cto\u201d part). This potentially obfuscates which bitcoins were sent from which address to which address, and breaks the assumption that all inputs belong to the same user.\nMimblewimble (and a\u00a0fix by Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra) takes this concept a bit further and completely gets rid of transactions once a new block is created. Instead of transactions, Mimblewimble blocks mainly consist of three lists: a list of new inputs (referring to old outputs), a list of new outputs and a list of cryptographic signatures created with the aforementioned dummy outputs.\nUtilizing the Pedersen Commitment scheme, all nodes can use the input list and the output list, and verify that no bitcoins were created out of thin air. The dummy output signatures, meanwhile, prove that all individual transactions must have been valid. Acting rather like \u201cstamps of approval,\u201d these dummy output signatures only add up mathematically if the whole transaction itself does.\nAnd since it is never revealed which inputs spent bitcoins to which outputs exactly, nor how many bitcoins were actually spent, no trace of funds can be established at all. As such, Mimblewimble presents a tremendous boon for privacy and fungibility.\nScalability\nAnd then there\u2019s the scalability improvement.\nCurrently, many transactions on the Bitcoin network are linked. Spending a bitcoin really takes an output from a previous transaction and turns it into an input of a new transaction. This means that if an older transaction is invalid, a newer transaction that relies on the older transaction is invalid, too. So to be able to validate all transactions on the Bitcoin network, nodes must know all transactions that ever took place; the entire blockchain. (That\u2019s currently some 80 gigabytes worth.)\nBut with Mimblewimble there is no longer really such a thing as a transaction history per coin. Each coin does have a specific block in which it was first created. But from then on, its value simply becomes part of the combined Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) set, which defines all outputs that store coins and could potentially be spent at any time.\nThis means that in order to verify new transactions, nodes no longer need to care about previous transactions. All they need to care about is that the specific outputs used are valid.\nWith even more clever math, nodes can establish the validity of outputs relatively easily. They just need the block headers of all blocks (a sort of index of blocks without all transaction data) and the aforementioned dummy output signatures: both relatively compact data-sets. All other transaction data \u2014 almost the entire blockchain \u2014 can be safely discarded.\nThe benefit compared to other anonymizing techniques is substantial. If Confidential Transactions and CoinJoin had been used in Bitcoin from day one, nodes would currently require more than a terabyte of data to operate. With Mimblewimble, they would need closer to 120 gigabytes. And perhaps even more interesting: where the blockchain necessarily has to grow over time, the required Mimblewimble dataset does not, and can actually shrink if more bitcoins are stored in fewer outputs.\nCompatibility\nNow for the bad news. Mimblewimble, in its current form, is not very compatible with the Bitcoin protocol. This is mainly because for Mimblewimble to work, script must be purged from transactions. As such, there would no longer be room for a whole set of Bitcoin features, like time-locked transactions (used for the Lightning Network among other things), atomic swaps (for cross-blockchain interoperability), and more.\nBut that doesn\u2019t make Mimblewimble useless. Mimblewimble may, for instance, be the perfect fit for a privacy-focused sidechain. Bitcoin users could lock their bitcoins into a specific output on the Bitcoin blockchain and \u201cmove\u201d their coins to the Mimblewimble chain. On this sidechain, users could transact freely and privately for as long as they want, until the new owner decides to \u201cmove\u201d the funds back to the Bitcoin blockchain by unlocking the original output.\nDue to the efficiency offered by Mimblewimble\u2019s sidechain, the added burden of maintaining it would be very manageable. Moreover, it could potentially unload much data from the Bitcoin blockchain, increasing scalability even for those who don\u2019t use Mimblewimble at all. Where sidechains are typically not considered a scaling solution, Mimblewimble offers one.\nFor a full technical explanation of Mimblewimble, including the mathematical details, see the white paper.", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 12}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nAccording to an Apple Insider report published on August 9, a disturbing trend has emerged on Apple\u2019s App Store as a series of malicious copycats of well-known Bitcoin wallet apps became available to download. Some of the fake wallets looked quite similar to the real thing but were specifically tweaked to steal bitcoins from unsuspecting users. As a result some $20,000\u00a0reportedly ended up in the pockets of scam artists before Apple was able to filter and remove the apps from its store.\nThe relative \u201csuccess\u201d of the fake apps and the ease at which they were manufactured and distributed, for some, calls into question Bitcoin\u2019s almost self-evident Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) ethos. Most Bitcoin wallets have been open source, which allows anyone to verify the legitimacy of the product. But as witnessed, it also allows scam artists to effortlessly copy that same software, to make minor adjustments in order to steal funds.\nAt least one popular wallet, the\u00a0Jaxx wallet for Bitcoin, Ethereum and most recently Dash, has employed an approach to this \u201dopen\u201d model that is unusual in the space. While all the code is still openly and publicly visible on Jaxx\u2019s website, this is limited to a type of view-only mode. The code can potentially be reviewed and verified by anyone but it cannot be copied and re-used \u2014 or at least not very easily.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Jaxx CEO Anthony Di Iorio explained:\n\u201cPart of the reason we do this is that we, as a company, necessarily have our operating costs and it\u2019s not easy to make money when you give away your code for free. But the other part is that this strategy makes it harder for malicious actors to impersonate our wallet. As a company, we want to offer quality control and that\u2019s impossible if anyone can simply take and tweak your product. We\u2019re trying to find a balance between transparency and keeping our software proprietary, and that includes the insertion of certain friction points to discourage people from stealing our code.\u201d\nOne of the wallets that was affected by the introduction of fake wallets, and which saw a fraudulent copycat appear in the App Store, is\u00a0GreenAddress. GreenAddress has always been entirely open source which indeed means the code can be trivially copied and tweaked. Yet, developer Lawrence Nahum continues to stand behind the FOSS model.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Nahum explained:\n\u201cA wallet with all its code out in the open makes it easier to impersonate; sure. But even if a wallet is not open source, I don't think you can really stop these kinds of imposters in the end. There would still be ways to mimic wallets, especially if the code is open for review. And not distributing source code also means it will have less scrutiny and therefore less security. Most developers I know don't review code on a web page.\u201d\nDi Iorio, however, does not agree that limiting the availability of Jaxx\u2019s code represents a trade-off in scrutiny or security.\n\u201cEven if a wallet is completely open source, there\u2019s no way to tell that the app you download from the app store is the same code,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd really, there are very few people who actually care. Almost no one verifies the code, even if it is open source. 95 percent of users just want their wallet to work. Whether or not it\u2019s open source doesn\u2019t change that.\u201d\nApple removed the fake wallets from the App Store after the Bitcoin community \u2014 including Nahum himself \u2014 filed complaints with the tech giant. This, along with Apple\u2019s own review process, appears to at least prevent long-term harm.\nNahum acknowledged this solution is not water-tight either.\n\u201cWalled gardens like Apple\u2019s don't scale much, as someone needs to check and verify every single app that\u2019s introduced,\u201d Nahum said. \u201cAnd malicious apps can improve too. The fake wallets we have seen were easy to detect by a trained bitcoiner. But in the future there may be wallets that make no copyright infringement and are only selectively malicious.\u201d\nAs such, says Nahum, a clear-cut solution is perhaps not available and users will simply need to be aware of potential copycats and act accordingly.\n\u201cWe will notify Apple for any bad app we see. But I personally advise people who download apps to get them from a verified source. Check whether the developer is known, look up reviews, see if it\u2019s submitted to bitcoin.org, always double check URLs and names and make sure you\u2019re downloading the real thing.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 16}

Gox and Silk Road only a couple of years ago, today tend to be about banks, exchanges and even central banks taking steps toward the operational use of blockchain technology. Nevertheless, it\u2019s interesting to see how this conclusion was reached by thorough economic analysis.\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to senior author Paolo Tasca, a director at the UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies, to find out more about the research and related issues. Tasca, a fintech economist specializing in P2P financial systems and systemic risk, is a former senior research economist at Deutsche Bundesbank and a co-editor of the book \u201cBanking Beyond Banks and Money.\u201d\n\u201cOur study starts by gathering together the minimum units of Bitcoin identities (the individual addresses) and it goes forward in grouping them into approximations of business entities, what we call \u2018super clusters,\u2019 by using tested techniques from the literature,\u201d explained Tasca. \u201cA super cluster can be thought of as an approximation of a business entity in that it describes a number of individual addresses that are owned or controlled collectively by the same beneficial owner for some special economic purposes. The majority of these important clusters are initially unknown and uncategorized.\u201d\n\u201cThe novelty of our study is given by the Pure User Group (PUG) and the Transaction Pattern (TP) analyses, by means of which we are able to ascribe the super clusters into specific business categories and outline a map of the network of payment relationships among them,\u201d continued Tasca.\nThe researchers identified four primary business categories in the Bitcoin economy: miners, gambling services, black markets and exchanges. It also included the three regimes mentioned above: early prototyping, \u201csin\u201d and legitimate enterprises.\nThe researchers studied the patterns of transaction behavior between the business categories and their users. The outcome of the study, which provides a quantitative assessment of the systemically important categories within the Bitcoin economy and their network of payment relationships, suggests a relevant public policy conclusion: Some recent concerns regarding the use of bitcoin for illegal transactions at the present time might be overstated and whatever such transactions may exist could further diminish as the Bitcoin economy continues to mature.\nThe University College London (UCL) Centre for Blockchain Technologies (CBT) is an interdepartmental, industry-oriented unit of UCL with the purpose to set the foundations for a new cross-disciplinary research area on distributed-consensus ledgers. The UCL CBT \u2014 currently comprising more than 30 research associates and seven funding departments with competences around three major research areas: Science and Technology, Economics and Finance and Policy, Law and Regulation \u2014 is committed to becoming the leading European research hub with an industry focus on the impact of blockchain technologies on socio-economic systems and the promotion of a safe and organic development and adoption of blockchain-based platforms.\nTasca isn\u2019t at liberty to share much information on UCL-CBT projects because of confidentiality restrictions. However, he confirmed that the UCL-CBT is involved in U.K. government initiatives to develop and deploy blockchain technology.\n\u201cSpecifically, in U.K. the UCL-CBT is interacting with: \u00a01) the Department of Work and Pension on a specific case study for payment system, 2) BoE, FCA on the use of smart contracts for algorithmic regulation and on the design of central bank issued digital currencies, 3) UCL-CBT is represented with Whitechapel Think Tank on distributed ledger technologies,\u201d noted Tasca. \u201cIn addition, the CBT is involved with several projects with the Alan Turing Institute.\u201d\nDiscussing the top opportunities and threats for blockchain-based fintech, Tasca noted that this is a complicated issue because blockchain technologies can find application in different domains. However, while most interest has come from the financial industry so far, Tasca expects to see more future activity in other sectors such as energy, telecommunications, media and healthcare.\n\u201cNew opportunities will emerge for them to redesign their business logic,\u201d Tasca told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\u201cThe major threat I see so far is the lack of \u2018technology literacy\u2019: the lack of the ability to understand how blockchain works in the world,\u201d continued Tasca. \u201cThis can hamper the development and spread of the technology. Thus, a more important educational effort is required to help blockchain become a mainstream technology used in different business processes: This represents the long-term aim and goal of the UCL-CBT.\u201d\nTo advance this important educational effort, the UCL-CBT will host the P2P Financial Systems 2016 (P2PFISY 2016) international workshop in September. \u201cThis is the second edition of the P2PFISY workshop,\u201d said Tasca. \u201cThis is a unique event in Europe because it will bring together scholars, regulators and practitioners interested in addressing questions of practical importance on digital currencies and blockchain technologies, P2P lending and crowdfunding, digital money transfer, mobile banking and mobile payments.\u201d\nTasca declined to comment on the recent unfortunate events related to Ethereum and The DAO. However, he is persuaded that blockchain technologies \u2014 especially through smart contracts, agent automation and DAOs \u2014 represent a new institutional technology: a new form of crypto-economic mechanism which allows governing of the difficulties inherent in transacting.\n\u201cOpportunism (e.g., adverse selection, moral hazard) is by far the more difficult market friction which has been handled so far via traditional organizational hierarchies (which exploit incomplete contracts) and bilateral agreements (which require trust between parties),\u201d Tasca told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cNow, blockchains, smart contracts and DAOs can eliminate opportunism or at least compete with traditional forms of hierarchies and bilateral contracting. Their use case applications are very large and may include escrows, voting, and eviction, among the others. The combined use of the blockchain and smart contracts creates a platform where individuals can exchange, manufacture and execute contracts with considerable sophistication and with little cost. In perspective, by using appropriate automations (and its inherent standardization), they may evolve and bring about the completeness of missing markets.\n\u201cI just wish to point out that our society is used to failures since the beginning of the first barter trades in the prehistoric age,\u201d continued Tasca. \u201cThese did not stop with the advent of more sophisticated technologies and markets. The fact that now, thanks to technology, business can be run independently \u2014 without human intervention in the decision-making process \u2014 by machines, is welcome, but do not remove the sources of business risks which can bring failures.\u201cHaving said that, in the particular case under discussion, many of Ethereum developers were also involved to some degree with The DAO. This brought an enormous conflict of interest because those who have the ability to shape changes in the Ethereum protocol had also a stake on one of its main applications, The DAO. Indeed, Ethereum is controlled by Vitalik Buterin mostly via his private Swiss-based non-profit organization, which received the proceeds of the ether auction, financing most of the development of Ethereum so far and which may own or control some of the resulting work.\u201cTo conclude, the conflict of interest led to a lose-lose strategy: Ethereum, also stakeholder of The DAO, decided to bail out the too-big-to-fail business. Without going into a debate about the quality of the code review process before releasing it to the market, this bailout has set a precedent and it would not be easy in the future to handle opportunistic moral-hazard behaviors.\u201cMaybe, to bring more transparency, the entire governance structure of the Ethereum community with clear rules between all the stakeholders shall be redesigned based on pure principles of decentralized autonomous organizations.\u201cAs a side note, the methodology used in our study could be applied to the Ethereum blockchain to map the network of payments there and include smart contracts and DAOs as categories.\u201d\nThe recent publication of the much-discussed Bank of England (BoE) working paper titled \u201cThe Macroeconomics of Central Bank Issued Digital Currencies,\u201d focused on the macroeconomic consequences of issuing central bank digital currency (CBDC) and shows that digital currencies are really and clearly on a fast path toward mainstream adoption.\nTasca noted that the paper implicitly borrows from the idea of George Danezis and Sarah Meiklejohn (2015) of having a cryptocurrency framework that decouples the generation of the monetary supply from the maintenance of the transaction ledger and suggested that central bank-certified institutions should act as verifiers. However, he noted that as it has been modelled, the CBDC is more similar to a \u201cdigicash\" type of solution than a P2P digital currency, and the generation of digital currency by the central bank is not clearly defined.", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 27}

The Venezuelan black market data displays a staggering 82 percent decrease in the value of the national currency in a span of 12 months.\nSince mid-2015, the U.S. dollar and other international currencies including Bitcoin have been perceived as ideal alternatives to the bolivar for both businesses and individuals because of the high international value of these two currencies.\nThe U.S. dollar, which leads the world\u2019s M1 money supply rankings, possesses the highest international exchange and conversion rate among all national currencies. Bitcoin, a digital currency based on a decentralized network of computers, offers its users ideal international conversion rates because of its decentralized, established international infrastructure and high liquidity.\nAs the government\u2019s control over the flow of U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies in the Venezuelan black market has tightened, Venezuelans have began to search for alternatives such as Bitcoin to store their wealth.\nThe increase in the demand for Bitcoin directly led to the explosive growth of Local Bitcoins Venezuela, a platform whereby Bitcoin buyers and sellers can process in-person trades without the involvement of an exchange. The demand for Bitcoin exchanges surged, with the country\u2019s first Bitcoin exchange, SurBitcoin, offering a platform for Venezuelans to purchase bitcoins through conventional bank payment methods.\nNaturally, as demand for bitcoins began to increase, the volume of the country\u2019s only Bitcoin exchange spiked, reaching a 24-hour volume of 48 BTC or $31,200.\n\nAlthough the daily trade volume of SurBitcoin is substantially lower than established Bitcoin exchanges in the Bitcoin market, the exchange is observing hundreds of buy orders on a daily basis, which, considering the financial instability of the Venezuelan economy, is extremely optimistic.\nEarlier this month, the price of Bitcoin for both buy and sell orders in Venezuela reached the lowest rate \u00a0in the entire Bitcoin market, hitting $407, while other major exchanges including Bitstamp and Kraken averaged at $635. This crash was due to the exchange\u2019s trouble integrating one of the main domestic banks in Venezuela that has been used to settle most of the trades on the platform.\nDespite the negative press, economic instability, and panic sale of Bitcoin on SurBitcoin, its daily volume has increased continuously since the exchange reopened on July 16, after suspending operations for a few days in order to deal with a series of legal issues and conflicts with an individual who had threatened a few of the exchange\u2019s key officers.", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 26}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin is designed as a peer-to-peer network, where nodes randomly connect to other nodes. Transactions and blocks are transmitted over this network by these nodes, until each has received all. This works quite well, as the distributed model makes Bitcoin relatively censorship-resistant; there is no central point of control to shut down or pressure into compliance.\nBut it also has a significant downside: The peer-to-peer network is relatively slow. As such, miners (and pools) sometimes waste hash power mining on top of an old block while a newer block is finding its way through the network. Transmission delay, therefore, benefits pooled mining as well as geographic clustering of miners, incentivizing a more centralized mining topology. This is generally considered one of the bottlenecks for scalability, as larger blocks (which can include more transactions) propagate even more slowly.\nOver the past years, therefore, several projects have been in development to increase the speed of block propagation. These projects focus on roughly two main issues: block compression to limit the amount of data that needs to be propagated over the network, and relay speed to cut the time it takes for blocks to propagate.\nThis two-part series provides an overview of these projects. Part 1 will cover block compression.\nHead First Mining\nEach Bitcoin block has a block header, which refers to all data in that block. A hash of this block header must be included in the subsequent block in order for that next block to be valid. That's how all blocks on the blockchain are chained.\nWhen a miner finds a block, it sends out the block header first \u2014 quickly followed by the rest of the block. This header, as well as the rest of the block, is checked for validity by receiving nodes. If valid, miners will mine \u201con top of\u201d that block using the block header. The block (including the header) is also forwarded to other nodes.\nHead First Mining is a trick proposed by former Bitcoin Core lead developer Gavin Andresen. With Head First Mining, miners don\u2019t wait for the complete block to arrive before they start mining a subsequent block. Instead, they immediately mine on top of the block header as soon as they receive it, and also forward the header to other nodes. This obviously saves time.\nHead First Mining does, however, have two disadvantages. First, miners don\u2019t know for sure whether the block they are mining on top of is really valid. While the block header may appear valid (due to sufficient proof of work), the block may, for example, include invalid transactions. As such, there is a bit of risk involved in this solution. \u201cAttacking\u201d fellow-miners with fake blockheaders to have them waste resources is expensive, but not impossible.\nSecond, as a perhaps bigger disadvantage, miners have no idea which transactions are included in the block they are mining on top of. As such, the only way to ensure their subsequent block is valid, and doesn\u2019t double-spend a transaction, is by including no transactions at all. Only after miners receive the complete block will they work on a block that does include transactions.\nOf course, this means that some blocks will be empty, which isn\u2019t great for network throughput. (But if the block size can be increased as a result, it might compensate.)\nCompact Blocks\nAs seen, Bitcoin nodes typically forward each other blocks over the peer-to-peer network. Unfortunately, this can cause significant outbound bandwidth spikes each time a new block is found, which can slow down block propagation in between nodes.\nCompact Blocks, developed by Bitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo, is a trick designed to decrease data-transmission. When a new block is found, nodes initially communicate only very compact hashes of transaction data. Because nodes already received the full transaction data when it was originally sent over the network, they can use these hashes to figure out which transactions are included in the block, and reconstruct the full block themselves.\nBut this trick does not always work out perfectly. If a node has not yet received the initial transaction before receiving the hashes, it cannot select the corresponding transaction. Additionally, in rare cases a wrong transaction may hash into a right hash, fooling a node into believing it received the right transaction \u2014 until it tries to reconstruct the block and finds it doesn't add up.\nIn both these cases of failure, the node simply requests the specific transaction data after all. Even with some full transactions in them, Compact Blocks will transmit over the network much faster and require significantly less bandwidth.\nXtreme Thinblocks\nXtreme Thinblocks, an option included in Bitcoin Unlimited, is similar to Compact Blocks in many ways; for example, rather than sending all transaction data, Xtreme Thinblocks transmit more compact hashes.\nAs the main difference, Xtreme Thinblocks use an extra mathematical trick to communicate transaction hashes: Bloom Filters. Without going into too much detail of exactly how this trick works, Bloom Filters are compact data structures that sort of turn the Compact Blocks trick upside down. Nodes can use Bloom Filters to figure out which transactions in a block a node is missing, and request only these.\nWeak Blocks\nThus, the validity of Bitcoin blocks is, in part, determined by the block header. More specifically, the hash of this block header must start with at least a specific amount of zeroes, partly resulting from a random number (\u201cnonce\u201d) also included in the block header. Having the sufficient amount of zeroes \u201cproves\u201d that the required proof of work was done.\nThe specific amount of zeroes required is determined by the difficulty. So, as an example that doesn't actually translate into reality, let's say the difficulty is eight. That would mean the hash of a blockheader would need to start with eight zeroes; a hashed block header that starts with six or seven zeroes would not be valid. It would perhaps be \u201calmost valid,\u201d but not quite.\nWeak Blocks, a relatively old idea, are essentially \u201calmost valid\u201d blocks. They are normal blocks in every way: They include transactions and all the rest \u2014 except that the hash of its header doesn't start with enough zeroes.\nWeak Blocks can be useful. By transmitting Weak Blocks over the network, miners can indicate on what block they're working, and which transactions it includes.\nThen, when a miner does find some way to hash the block correctly, he has a valid block. And since all other miners now already know on which block that miner was working, he really needs only to transmit a minimal amount of data: a confirmation and the correct nonce. So while the total amount of data sent over the network is actually increased (as weak blocks are transmitted all the time), the relevant data to mine on top of is limited.\nTomorrow:\u00a0\u00a0On Relay: How Different Bitcoin Developers are Speeding Up the Network (Part 2)", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 28}

BitMinter began in June 2011 and at its peak, it controlled 10 percent of global computing power for bitcoin mining, making it an attractive target for competitors and attackers alike. Nexusguard was able to deliver critical stability and maximum up-time for BitMinter, ensuring a predictable cash flow, uninterrupted by attacks.\nAnd BitMinter was able to pay in bitcoin.\nWhile BitMinter wasn\u2019t the use-case that got the bitcoin ball rolling with Nexusguard, BitMinter was the first bitcoin-centered client account with the company.\n\u201cAfter they became a customer,\u201d said Giannis, \u201cthey were thrilled that we would accept bitcoin as a form of payment, enabling us to keep them as a loyal client and fan of Nexusguard.\u201d\nBitPay\u2019s Email Billing Tool\nTypically, when it comes to accepting payment from international clients, most companies opt for electronic bills or wire transfers. These both have their shortcomings: higher processing costs, fraud, delays in payment, payments that arrive with less than the full amount due and little or no information about fees.\nFor processing bitcoin payments, Nexusguard turned to BitPay. Established in 2011, BitPay provides merchants with an\u00a0email billing tool that they can use for invoicing via bitcoin, enabling them to eliminate the transfer wait times, high fees and complex processing steps involved in international wire transfers. Nexusguard is one client taking advantage of the email billing tool to bypass the legacy international transfer system.\n\u201cBitcoin billing is especially popular among merchants that provide consulting, freelance work or software as a service,\u201d BitPay Marketing Associate James Walpole told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThe transactions these firms accept through our email billing tool make up more than 10 percent of our total processing volume in USD terms and the average order size of a B2B billing payment is twenty five times the size of an average consumer bitcoin payment.\u201d\nAs well as providing its services to clients such as Nexusguard, BitPay billing is also attracting smaller clients who want to reach people across the world in a fast, secure and convenient way. Latin America is one area that is experiencing the greatest transaction growth with a year-over-year increase of 1,747 percent in 2015.\n\n\u201cThe region is experiencing rapid growth in ecommerce and mobile phone use, but credit card payments are still only available to a fraction of the total population,\u201d said Walpole. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the reason why bitcoin makes sense for Latin America\u2019s online consumers and for international businesses that want to reach Latin American markets.\u201d\nThe Future\nThe fact that Nexusguard accepts bitcoin as payment has made it easier for companies in the space, like BitMinter, to pay them in a far more convenient way, without having to go through the additional hassle of converting bitcoins to U.S. dollars. As more companies discover and accept bitcoin, they begin to realize the potential for them to attract and retain a broader clientele.\n\u201cOur five years of experience in bitcoin payment processing has helped us build a strong case that bitcoin can solve old problems for ecommerce and B2B payments in new ways,\u201d said Walpole. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to reach out to more merchants like Nexusguard who can save money, reduce payment fraud and reach a global customer base by adding bitcoin as a payment option.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 27}

It could also be called \u2018deposit-coin\u2019 or \u2018settlement-coin.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t exist as a medium of exchange outside the experimental wholesale payment system. Our only goal at this stage is to understand the mechanics, limits and possibilities of this technology.\u201d\u2028\u2028\nB\u00e9gin said that the Bank of Canada chose to experiment with Ethereum because the members were the most familiar and experienced with coding on that platform.\n\u201cThis particular project is one part of a larger Bank of Canada work plan to investigate the distributed ledger technology and better understand its characteristics,\u201d he said. \u201cWe may look at other platforms going forward.\u201d\nAccording to B\u00e9gin, the greater potential for DTL lies beyond the Bitcoin blockchain, in applications outside of digital currencies.\n\u201cFintech is an important part of the Bank\u2019s research agenda, and this not a coincidence,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many benefits of fintech, but realizing those, while guarding against the risks it could create, will require strong collaboration among policymakers, incumbent financial institutions and new entrants. For the Bank of Canada, one of the best ways to really understand this technology is to build and experiment with it, in conjunction with the industry. It\u2019s our job to be forward-looking.\u201d\n\u2028Fintech Experts: Regulatory Uncertainty is Stifling Fintech Development in Canada\nMeanwhile the Canadian Money Service Business Association (CMSBA), representing more than 800 MSBs, is petitioning the federal government\u2019s Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), the agency responsible for regulating fintech, to clearly define money services businesses to include digital currencies businesses.\nAmber D. Scott, CEO of Outlier Solutions, told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cThere are few Canadian banks that will deal with Bitcoin companies, and in some instances only if those companies are registered as MSBs with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC).\u201d\nThe CMSBA sent a letter to Canada\u2019s Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) recently, saying members have had their bank accounts closed in \u201cwhat appears to be a sector-wide sweep even though they are compliant with all anti-money laundering rules.\u201d\nIn a regulatory Catch-22, as part of their \u201cde-risking strategy,\u201d banks need FINTRAC to define digital fintech startups as money services businesses before they can offer a business account.\n\u201cRegulators such as FINTRAC and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) are known to have relatively negative views of MSBs (whether this is organization-wide or the bias of some examiners I cannot say),\u201d said Scott, \u201cwhich makes me wonder if the MSB designation will do more harm than good when it comes to the ability of Bitcoin companies to access the traditional financial system.\n\u201cEven if our regulatory regime nets out favorably (and I hope that it does), access to banking may force companies to choose other jurisdictions. This is truly unfortunate as Canada has the potential to become a hub for fintech innovation \u2014 but we are rapidly depleting any advantages that we once had.\u201d\nThe Financial Post reports that recently an unidentified bank was fined $1.1 million by FINTRAC for providing accounts to money service businesses and that an apparent crackdown is making it harder for fintech companies to get bank accounts.\nFINTRAC, on the other hand, is stalling on defining Bitcoin and digital currencies businesses as \u201cMoney Services Businesses\u201d leaving the fintech startups in a Catch-22 between the banks and regulators.\nIn an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Kyle Kemper, Executive Director of the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, noted the need for the Canadian Bitcoin community to advocate for progress. \u201cAt this point the lobby for crypto pales in comparison to the banking and payments lobby. A course of inaction could lead to a greater movement away from the fiat in general as crypto solution providers' solutions become more robust, frictionless, and adopted.\u201d\nCoinbase Bumps Up Against Canada\u2019s Regulatory Uncertainty\nCoinbase, one of the world\u2019s most successful Bitcoin companies, recently notified its Canadian customers that it was withdrawing from the Canadian market and could no longer support transactions in Canadian dollars.\nAt the same time, the company was setting up in Japan and had recently expanded to Australia, making it the 33rd country served by Coinbase.\nFred Ehrsam, president and co-founder of Coinbase, said in a recent Reddit AMA:\n\u201cOur mission is to create an open financial system for the world and part of that is making digital currency as easy to access, in as many countries as possible. So it makes me sad that we've had an interruption there [in Canada]. The goal is to get it back online when we have a good payment service provider or bank in Canada. A bunch proactively reached out when that news went out, so hopefully we will get a good replacement soon.\u201d\n\u201cThe fact that they [Coinbase] struggle with one of the primary pillars of being an exchange, being able to process fiat withdrawals and deposits, shows that Canada is difficult environment for Bitcoin Fintech companies to operate in,\u201d said Kemper.\nBank of Canada Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins noted recently that what she calls \u201ctraditional trusted intermediaries\u201d may be replaced by more convenient technologies; however, she doesn\u2019t believe that Canada\u2019s regulatory body is lagging behind.\n\u201cFintech regulators also face the difficult challenge of balancing the need to ensure the safety and soundness of the financial markets against the need to encourage further innovation,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe regulatory framework needs to adapt so that the door is not opened to unmanaged financial and operational risks, unchecked critical dependencies within our financial system and moral hazard. Promoting financial stability is a core function of the Bank of Canada, and we take a system-wide perspective when we monitor risks.\u201d\nAccording to Scott, however, the system is set up in such a way that many companies are having a difficult time playing by all the rules, all the time.\n\u201cIn many ways, the banks are acting as both gatekeepers and de facto regulators, which is truly unfortunate. We've spoken with the CEO of a company who asked a bank that had committed to investing $1 million if the bank would open a business account for them and the answer was \u2018no.\u2019 It's completely baffling to me that a bank would be willing to invest money in a business but not provide an operating account for that business.\u201d\nScott noted that MSBs and fintech companies are sometimes afraid to go on record because they don't want to lose their existing bank accounts, including accounts that may have been opened covertly under the guise of software companies or numbered companies.\n\u201cBanks and credit unions are afraid to open accounts or to keep them open, since they face pressure from FINTRAC and OSFI to treat all of these accounts as high risk (which is not a regulatory requirement) or to close them,\u201d said Scott.\n\u201cThese tactics are directly driving risky behavior,\u201d she added. \u201cUltimately, the only ones winning at this game are criminals, because legitimate businesses are being forced to act evasively, which in turn, makes illicit activity more difficult to identify.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 28}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nEthereum Classic is dominating the cryptocurrency news cycle. After a slumber of some days following the Ethereum hard fork that refunded investors of the hacked DAO, the unforked and re-named Ethereum blockchain and its native token classic ether (ETC) surged. Exchanges enabled trade in the digital currency, investors bought in, miners pointed their hardware to it, and a new development community began to form.\nBut Ethereum Classic also has led to chaos and uncertainty. The forked half of the chain \u2014 sometimes dubbed \u201cEthereum One,\u201d and supported by the Ethereum Foundation \u2014 is still running as well. Ethereum has, therefore, effectively split into two networks. An unprecedented situation in the cryptocurrency space.\nThe question on everybody's mind is, therefore: How will this end?\nIn this three-part series, Bitcoin Magazine provides an overview of some of the scenarios that circulate throughout the different Ethereum communities and the wider blockchain industry.\nPart 1 of this series covered how the great Ethereum schism can end relatively well for Ethereum One (but not so much for Ethereum Classic).\nIn Part 2: How the great Ethereum schism can end relatively well for Ethereum Classic (but not so much for Ethereum One).\nAuthor\u2019s note: Not all scenarios or nuances may be accounted for, nor does inclusion in this list \u2014 or order thereof \u2014 say anything about likelihood.\nScenario 4: Ethereum Classic Overtakes (or Catches Up With) Ethereum One\nEthereum Classic may continue growing to the point where it catches up with, or overtakes, Ethereum One by market share and hash power. While this was originally a long-term plan at best for the Ethereum Classic community, the recent surge suggests it might happen much sooner than anyone expected.\nThis scenario could play out in several ways. Here are more sub-scenarios.\nPerhaps Ethereum Classic draws in a whole new set of users that were never interested in Ethereum before. This could happen for multiple reasons. With the removal of a (perceived) central point of control \u2014 the Ethereum Foundation \u2014 Ethereum Classic seems to have attracted a new wave of interest already. Meanwhile, Ethereum Classic is cheaper to use than Ethereum One. And its dedication to censorship-resistance and immutability may attract a certain class of users and use-cases as well - especially since all properties of Ethereum One should be offered as well. And, of course, there may be other reasons.\nOr, perhaps more and more Ethereum One users will switch back to Ethereum Classic. This could also happen for several reasons. It's very unclear, for example, how much support the hard fork ever really had; this support may have been severely overstated. And even if the hard fork had much support before it happened, users may reassess their original position now that they are no longer financially invested in The DAO. Perhaps more of them will come to agree that immutability is a vital property of a blockchain, or that the Ethereum Foundation represents a single point of failure. Or maybe the Ethereum Foundation will make more controversial decisions, driving users away. And again, there may be other reasons.\nThere are also different possible outcomes if Ethereum Classic overtakes Ethereum One.\nFirst of all: Ethereum One software clients will not automatically switch back to the (original) Ethereum Classic chain if it ever becomes the chain with the most proof of work. (This is also referred to as the \u201clongest\u201d chain \u2014 though it's not really about length.) There would still be two separate chains, with two distinct currencies.\nRegardless, more users may consider Ethereum Classic the \u201creal\u201d Ethereum from that moment on. Before and shortly after the hard fork, many proponents of the hard fork maintained that the \u201creal\u201d Ethereum would be the one with longest chain. If Ethereum Classic overtakes Ethereum One, by their own logic these users would have to switch back. (Or they would have to re-think their position on what determines the \u201creal\u201d Ethereum.)\nEither way, Ethereum inventor and project lead Vitalik Buterin \u2014 on behalf of the Ethereum Foundation \u2014 has committed to work on the Ethereum One project. Assuming he does, the Ethereum Classic project could still copy code from Ethereum One, even if Ethereum One is much smaller. While it may be strange for the most important developers to primarily develop for a minority chain, it does not have to be a fundamental problem.\nIt is also possible, though, that the Ethereum Classic project develops a more distinct technological vision over time. In that case, Ethereum Classic and Ethereum One could copy code from each other \u2014 and reject what they don't like.\nScenario 5: Ethereum One Splinters\nAs mentioned in Part 1 of this series, now that they appear viable, Ethereum coin-splits may happen more often. And, of course, that\u2019s not only true for Ethereum Classic; Ethereum One may experience further splintering as well.\nThis scenario would closely resemble the scenario where Ethereum Classic splinters, except that it would be the Ethereum One community that branches out, or both Ethereum Classic and Ethereum One do. Perhaps in such a way that there will be no clear \u201cmain chain\u201d at all. Instead, all different Ethereum projects could co-exist much like different altcoins do today (not counting Bitcoin.) They would vary in size and popularity over time, providing for different use-cases, with no clear winner.\nScenario 6: Only Ethereum Classic Lives On, Ethereum One Fails\nAs a sixth scenario, Ethereum Classic may not only overtake Ethereum One, but essentially \u201cdefeat\u201d the fork attempt, and \u201crestore\u201d the pre-fork Ethereum chain as the one and only Ethereum chain.\nEthereum One failure scenarios relating to Ethereum Classic resemble the examples in Scenario 4, except that these scenarios would continue to play out until only the Ethereum Classic chain is left \u2014 perhaps as a sort of snowball-effect back to the original chain.\nAnd there\u2019s an additional category of scenario\u2019s that could spell the end for Ethereum One entirely: scenario\u2019s pertaining to the Ethereum Foundation. Since Ethereum One and the Ethereum Foundation are closely linked, the foundation may be cause for an exodus from Ethereum One to Ethereum Classic, which does not have such a (perceived) single point of failure.\nFor one, the Ethereum Foundation might change course itself. If the Ethereum Foundation ever switched focus back to Ethereum Classic, support for Ethereum One might just disappear entirely. This could happen voluntarily, perhaps for one of the reasons described in Scenario 4. Or maybe the Ethereum Foundation will be forced to focus on Ethereum One by court order; it has been suggested that legal cases are already in the making.\nOr maybe key members of the Ethereum Foundation quit altogether. Perhaps voluntarily, because they don\u2019t want to develop for the platform any longer. Or perhaps involuntarily, for instance due to mentioned legal trouble. And there are some darker scenario\u2019s as well, scenario\u2019s where \u201csomething bad\u201d happens to these key members.\n(Though in most of these scenarios, as pointed out in the first part of this series, Ethereum One could still live on as an irrelevant altcoin.)\nIn Part 3: How the great Ethereum schism can end badly for both Ethereum Classic and Ethereum One.", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 30}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin is designed as a peer-to-peer network, where nodes randomly connect to other nodes. Transactions and blocks are transmitted over this network by these nodes, until each has received all. This works quite well, as the distributed model makes Bitcoin relatively censorship-resistant; there is no central point of control to shut down or pressure into compliance.\nBut it also has a significant downside: The peer-to-peer network is relatively slow. As such, miners (and pools) sometimes waste hash power mining on top of an old block while a newer block is finding its way through the network. Transmission delay, therefore, benefits pooled mining as well as geographic clustering of miners, incentivizing a more centralized mining topology. This is generally considered one of the bottlenecks for scalability, as larger blocks (which can include more transactions) propagate even more slowly.\nOver the past years, therefore, several projects have been in development to increase the speed of block propagation. These projects focus on roughly two main issues: block compression to limit the amount of data that needs to be propagated over the network, and relay speed to cut the time it takes for blocks to propagate.\nThis two-part series provides an overview of these projects. Part 1 covered block compression. Part 2 will examine ways of speeding up the network.\nFast Relay Network (AKA Matt Corallo's Relay Network)\nThe Fast Relay Network, also known as Matt Corallo's Relay Network, is a relatively straightforward relay network setup by Corallo, and has existed for some years. The Fast Relay Network consists of nine nodes, distributed strategically around the globe. Designed as a hub-and-spoke model, miners can connect to the relay node closest to them to send and receive blocks over this network. This is significantly faster than Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network.\nThe main downside of the Fast Relay Network is that it's relatively centralized: Corallo controls it. And while the software is open source, no one else has set up a similar open relay network so far. (Though mining pools do have similar \u2014 but closed \u2014 setups among themselves, and typically for \u201cinternal\u201d use among their own nodes.)\nFor more details, see Bitcoin Magazine's  earlier article  on the Fast Relay Network.\nFalcon\nAs blocks are transferred over Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network, they are really transmitted in several IP-packets. Each node on the network receives each packet, and reconstructs blocks from the data in these different packets. Once the block is reconstructed and considered valid, nodes forward the block to other nodes. Again, of course, in different packets.\nTo speed this process up, Cornell University researchers Soumya Basu, Ittay Eyal and Emin G\u00fcn Sirer are developing the Falcon relay network. Falcon uses a technique called \u201ccut-through routing,\u201d where nodes don't wait to receive all packages to forward them. Instead, they forward each package as soon as they receive it, while initially checking only the block header. They reconstruct the block in the meantime, as the rest of the packages arrive.\nThis solution does have one disadvantage: Nodes can validate a full block only after they have received all required packages. As such, there's a small risk of a dishonest miner transmitting invalid packages all across the network, wasting competitor resources.\nTo solve this, the Falcon network operates with gatekeepers: the Cornell University team. As such, the Falcon network itself isn't entirely decentralized; the idea is that it decentralizes Bitcoin's overall network topology through diversity.\nFIBRE\nAs noted, blocks on the Bitcoin network are really transmitted in several IP-packets. Unfortunately, package-loss is a significant bottleneck for propagation speed; even on relay networks. While it doesn\u2019t necessarily happen very often, packet-loss can cause spikes in transmission-time, as nodes need to re-communicate data.\nFIBRE (Fast Internet Bitcoin Relay Engine), also developed by Corallo, is a re-designed relay-protocol. As perhaps its most interesting solution, it is built on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). This is an alternative to the far more common TCP internet protocol, and currently mostly used for Voice over IP (Skype) and gaming. As an important differentiator from all the above protocols, UDP allows FIBRE to use a nifty trick known as Forward Error Correction (FEC). This lets nodes reconstruct all of the transmitted data even if some of it got lost on the way.\nAnd: FIBRE is specifically designed for Compact Blocks; the innovation discussed in Part 1 of this series. The combination of FIBRE with Compact Blocks, as statistics collected by Corallo show, make FIBRE nearly as fast as the speed of light.\nLastly, FIBRE is designed to be a more decentralized alternative to other relay networks. Specifically, as a key feature of FIBRE, it's designed as a sort of \u201cadd on\u201d for Bitcoin Core, so anyone who runs a node should be able set up his or her own network.", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 29}

Some within the Ethereum One community are still expecting, and perhaps hoping, for this scenario to play out.\nEthereum Classic can fail in several ways, sub-scenarios if you will.\nSome consider Ethereum Classic nothing but a scam. The tokens on the \u201cabandoned\u201d side of the chain (abandoned by a majority of hash power, so far) are inherently worthless, they maintain. Anyone who says otherwise must, therefore, be trying to scam people by selling them these \u201cworthless\u201d coins. And like any other scam, it will come to an end sooner or later.\nOthers describe Ethereum Classic as a sort of anti-Ethereum movement, driven by trolls or adversaries that would like to see Ethereum or the hard fork fail. If these trolls or adversaries are ignored long enough, they will also have to cease their effort at some point.\nYet others claim that development of Ethereum Classic, and development of applications built on top of Ethereum Classic, will grind to a halt as focus re-shifts to Ethereum One: the blockchain and currency with a bigger network effect. This would render Ethereum Classic useless and cause people to leave the chain behind.\nOr maybe Ethereum Classic will become more or less obsolete at some point in the future. If Ethereum One somehow implements changes that prevent similar contentious hard forks, it may convince the Ethereum Classic community that the \u201crollback\u201d really was a one-time only event, and have them decide to re-join Ethereum One.\nLastly, the Ethereum Classic network can be 51%-attacked \u2014 perhaps by miners supportive of Ethereum One. If this 51%-attack persists long enough, other miners as well as users may give up and abandon the chain for good.\nThe counter-argument to all these failure scenarios, is that cryptocurrencies have a way of hardly ever really dying. All it really takes to keep a cryptocurrency going is a single user with a spark of idealism, hope, interest or some other reason to run the software and mine coins.\nThat said, it is possible that one or several of the failure scenarios would cause Ethereum Classic to lose its momentum and shine. It could end up as one of the hundreds of completely irrelevant altcoins that almost no one really cares about; a practical failure.\nScenario 2: Ethereum Classic Lives On as the Minority Chain\nThis scenario was originally expected by the Ethereum\u00a0Classic initiators.\nBefore the hard fork, the Ethereum Classic project leaders hoped to claim, perhaps, 1 percent of the network hash rate and value. Additionally, they expected it would take weeks or months to build a bit of community, infrastructure and everything else a cryptocurrency requires to be viable. In the meantime, the Ethereum Classic project would simply copy any (non-controversial) code from the Ethereum One branch to keep the project moving forward.\nAs such, Ethereum Classic would continue to exist as an alternative to fall back on, perhaps in case the forked chain should fail for some unexpected reason. Or maybe because the Ethereum One developers would opt for another contentious hard fork in the future. Detractors could then switch to Ethereum Classic, even with their old ETC balance intact.\nWhile not everyone on the Ethereum One side of the community may be happy with Ethereum Classic's existence, it perhaps doesn't need to be all that harmful either. As long as Ethereum One is considered the main chain, most attention and development would, in this scenario, focus on Ethereum One, which could move ahead as planned.\nThis scenario can still play out, but with the added benefit for Ethereum Classic that the initial wave of adoption happened much sooner than many expected.\nScenario 3: Ethereum Classic Splinters\nNow that it appears viable, Ethereum coin-splits may happen more often. And additional branches may split off from Ethereum Classic in particular, as that community fundamentally rejects centralized leadership to guide the project into a single direction.\nIndeed, a new schism seems to already be forming within the Ethereum Classic community. Specifically, some users want to follow Ethereum One's every move except for \u201cbailouts\u201d and similar breaches of Ethereum Classic's core principles. Others prefer to adopt more of a distinct technological vision for Ethereum Classic, perhaps, most importantly, rejecting a future switch to a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm.\nEthereum One may, in that case, remain the main \u201cEthereum branch\u201d while three, four, or perhaps even many more minor branches, co-exist. Perhaps with their own \u201cspecialty\u201d; one \u201ccommercial\u201d branch for everyday-use cases, one more \u201cradically immutable\u201d branch, perhaps a \u201cdarker\u201d branch suited for illegal activity, and maybe more. This sort of specialization would not be dissimilar to many other open-source projects.\nIn Part 2:\u00a0How the great Ethereum schism can end relatively well for Ethereum Classic (but not so much for Ethereum One.)", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 30}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nBlockstream announced the acquisition of Bitcoin wallet provider GreenAddress on Wednesday. In a post on the company\u2019s official blog, Blockstream President Adam Back noted, \u201cGreenAddress has a demonstrated track record of delivering an industry-leading product that prioritizes security, privacy and convenience.\u201d\nGreenAddress has been quick to implement new Bitcoin features, such as fee estimation and replace-by-fee, into its own wallet. Also, GreenAddress developer Lawrence Nahum is a supporter of the Bitcoin Core scalability roadmap and says he\u2019s excited about the improvements that are coming to Bitcoin in the near future.\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Nahum to get the details on what GreenAddress will be working on now that it is under the Blockstream umbrella of Bitcoin products and services.\nImplementing CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY\nNahum was quick to bring up the upcoming implementation of OP_CHECKSEQUENCYVERIFY (CSV) to improve the refund process on their 2-of-2 multisignature addresses.\nOne of the key features of GreenAddress is the ability to complete what are essentially instant Bitcoin transactions. This works by putting user funds in a 2-of-2 multisig address where the two parties are the user and GreenAddress. If someone trusts GreenAddress to not double spend a transaction, then he or she can trust this user\u2019s GreenAddress wallet to do the same.\nA refund transaction is also pre-signed and held by the user to prevent funds being locked up in an address that requires a signature from GreenAddress to send a transaction. Currently, a pre-signed nLocktime refund transaction is emailed to the user when a transaction is received on a 2-of-2 address (including change transactions). This transaction becomes valid after a predetermined amount of time.\nWith CSV, the refund process can be handled directly on the blockchain. The gist of it is that a 2-of-2 multisignature address will be controlled only by the user after a certain amount of time has passed.\nCSV also will get rid of a window of trust that is involved with the current nLocktime process. This window of trust involves the problem of an nLocktime transaction ID not being set in stone until it is confirmed on the blockchain; this issue is known as transaction malleability.\nNahum noted that he wants to wait until MAST (Merkalized Abstract Syntax Tree) is available before implementing CSV due to reasons related to user privacy.\n\u201cOnce MAST is into play, you only see the 2-of-2,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou don't see the [refund transaction] unless it is used, which means you only reveal the nLocktime when you do recovery with MAST.\u201d\nIn other words, MAST would enable the same level of privacy for these addresses as they enjoy today with the added benefit of CSV.\nBuilding a Bitcoin and Sidechains Wallet Library\nIn addition to working on its own wallet, the GreenAddress team will also be working on a library that any developer will be able to use.\n\u201cThe library will help us deliver better and consistently to all platforms without rewriting a lot of code for each platform,\u201d said Nahum.\nThe library is in C but it will have bindings to other major languages such as Java and Python. Other C libraries, such as libsecp256k1, will also be reused in this new library from the GreenAddress team.\n\u201cWith the library, we do not want to reinvent the wheel,\u201d added Nahum. \u201cBut we do want C to support all platforms, so we are reusing where applicable.\u201d\nNahum explained that C was chosen as the language for the library because it can work everywhere and it\u2019s also easy to interface with other popular languages. As an example provided by Nahum, bitcoinj can be used on iOS with some frameworks, but running it on a hardware wallet would be difficult.\nAccording to Nahum, support for various features enabled in Blockstream\u2019s Elements Alpha sidechain also will be supported in the library.\n\u201cSo far, we have support for some of the features of Elements Alpha and we want to complete support, plus add support for features that will be released in the future (at least the ones that are applicable to the wallet),\u201d said Nahum. \u201cWe already added support for Confidential Transactions in GreenAddress before Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong as we were experimenting with the tech.\u201d\n\u201cBut our support was very proof-of-concept,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot more work is needed to make our support more robust.\u201d\n\u201cOur goal with the library is to make it easier for us and other developers to build powerful, secure, and fast multi-platform wallets for Bitcoin that support sidechains. I think this is good for the library as it makes it more modular and it allows people to innovate more. It will also be a way to get an early peek at features that could eventually come to Bitcoin.\u201d\nNahum would like the C library to work with Bitcoin mainnet, the testnet and sidechains.\nThe Long-Term Vision for GreenAddress\nLong term, the plan for GreenAddress is to provide its users with a user-friendly, convenient wallet while also learning as little about them as possible.\n\u201cOur ideal place is where we don't know which transactions are involved, yet we can validate the things users wants us to validate such as two-factor authentication or spending limits,\u201d explained Nahum. \u201cThe less data we have the better.\u201d\nNahum also shared his excitement for new improvements, such as Schnorr signatures, that should be added to Bitcoin in the near future.\n\u201cSchnorr is going to be great,\u201d he said. \u201cFinally, multi-signature and single-signature transactions will cost the same in fees and will look the same from outside. Plus, the transaction will be smaller.\n\u201cWith some of these improvements, we can not only improve privacy and security but also ease-of-use, as there will be less for users to keep track of (i.e. no nLocktime files) while having better privacy and atomic security,\u201d Nahum concluded.\nWhile the Bitcoin Core wallet still has better privacy features, GreenAddress offers unique protection against malware via two-factor authentication. GreenBits, another wallet from the GreenAddress team, also allows users to avoid trusting a third party by allowing them to connect to their own full nodes.", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 1}

Reflecting on the concept of open network introduced by the OCC in its white paper, it is only logical to offer an open regulatory environment for fintech startups that are focused on bringing innovative and disruptive financial services to the country.\nThe OCC, an independent bureau within the Treasury Department, holds the ability to regulate and supervise all national banks and the federal branches of foreign banks in the United States. Thus, the OCC is one of the few government organizations that possesses authority over independent states and their regulations on money transmission.\nIf the OCC is as committed to innovation and development of open network technology as it says in its white paper, it should maximize its resources to lead each state in creating a viable ecosystem for fintech companies to operate in, similar to the regulatory environment of the United Kingdom.\nThe U.K. and its regulatory bodies have persistently opted for favorable policies for fintech and digital currency startups since early 2015, after realizing the market for and importance of fintech to the economy of the nation.\nIts government took an alternative approach, establishing \u00a0different regulations for businesses in the fintech industry in order to enable the fintech sector to operate and prosper.\n\u201cOur interviews suggested the U.K. government should consider additional actions to support the Fintech community, particularly in the areas of improving access to talent; encouraging closer collaboration and information sharing between established financial services businesses and Emergent Fintech; and actively championing the sector,\u201d states\u00a0an official report commissioned by U.K. Trade and Investment.\nApart from local regulatory policies, the U.K. government and its agencies including the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) went as far as securing partnerships with other global organizations in South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong to improve its fintech market and position itself as the leading nation in financial technologies.\nSingapore and South Korea, for instance, have partnered with the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority to create a bridge between Singaporean and South Korean fintech startups with the British. The partnership established a friendly ecosystem for fintech startups to discuss emerging technologies and the latest trends in the market. With this program, and favorable regulations from the federal government, Singapore and South Korea have quickly escalated as the leaders of the Asian fintech and blockchain industries.\nFurthermore, European countries such as Switzerland and Germany also have begun to\u00a0develop friendly regulations for fintech startups, recognizing their significant impact to their economies. As a result, German fintech companies\u00a0received more venture capital funding than startups in London and the United States, securing more than $1.6 billion in investment.\nThe Swiss Federal Tax Administration\u2019s announcement in mid-2015\u00a0that it was eliminating value-added tax (VAT) for Bitcoin spurred interest among investors and venture capital firms, enabling fintech startups to secure large sums of funding from local investors.\nConsidering the potential of fintech and its rapid growth in the American and global markets, the United States and the OCC should follow the lead of countries such as the U.K. and encourage the government to establish regulatory policies that won\u2019t leave the fintech industry lagging behind their global competitors.", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 1}

Representatives Clarify the Proposed Anti-Money Laundering Directive", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/e-u-representatives-clarify-the-proposed-anti-money-laundering-directive-1470242294/", "birthday": "Aug 3, 2016  12:38 PM EST", "date": "2016-08-03 17:38:00", "content": "Aaron van Wirdum is interested in decentralized consensus, FOSS, privacy in the digital age, censorship resistant payments, and more of that stereotypical Bitcoin stuff. Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nLast month, the European Commission published a\u00a0draft directive proposing to extend anti-money laundering (AML) regulation to both virtual currency exchange services and custodial wallet providers. The draft suggests that many Bitcoin companies operating within the European Union will need to apply know-your-customer (KYC) types of checks on their users, to be enforced by 2017.\nPhrasing of the directive left some uncertainty over its extent, however \u2014in particular over what are considered \u201cwallet providers offering custodial services of credentials necessary to access virtual currencies.\u201d\nFor clarification, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to E.U. representatives.\nIntent\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, the E.U. representatives (who preferred not to be mentioned by name or quoted directly) explained that the concept and motive of the proposal is straightforward.\nFrom the perspective of the European Commission, virtual currencies present a problem as they allow money to circulate easily, and it's difficult to know who's transacting with whom. To address this, the E.U. wants to set up checkpoints: Custodian wallet providers and exchange services would be required to monitor transactions on their platform and report suspicious activity.\nWithin that context, the representatives acknowledged that the proposed regulation should not apply to any services that happen to hold onto customer private keys. There is, for instance, no intention to regulate Lightning Network nodes or mining pool operators.\nCustodial wallet providers, under the provision, are wallet providers that hold onto at least one private key for customers. Naturally, that includes wallet providers that hold full control over users' private keys, such as Circle and Xapo. But it also includes services that hold onto a single key in a multi-signature setup, even if they can't spend on behalf of customers, such as GreenAddress or Blocktrail. Wallet providers that do not hold any private keys at all \u2014 like Mycelium or Blockchain \u2014 would not fall under the provision.\nThe E.U. representatives also indicated there might be further discussion on a potential minimum threshold. Under the current proposal, any custodial wallet provider, as well as exchange service, would be required to apply AML/KYC checks on customers \u2014 even for trivial amounts. The representatives indicated this may be reconsidered to perhaps introduce a minimum threshold under which no identity verification would be required. (But this is not guaranteed.)\nAnonymity\nAnother part of the draft directive that garnered attention is a paragraph pertaining to future research. Specifically, the European Commission suggests that users and Bitcoin addresses may have to be able to be linked to prevent nefarious use of the digital\u00a0currency.\nThe draft directive reads:\n\n\u201cThe inclusion of virtual exchange platforms and custodian wallet providers will not entirely address the issue of anonymity attached to virtual currency transactions, as a large part of the virtual currency environment will remain anonymous because users can also transact without exchange platforms or custodian wallet providers. To combat the risks related to the anonymity, national Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) should be able to associate virtual currency addresses to the identity of the owner of virtual currencies. In addition, the possibility to allow users to self-declare to designated authorities on a voluntary basis should be further assessed.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, the E.U. representatives acknowledged that these ideas will be further assessed \u2014 but not any time soon. Specifically, a report scheduled for 2019 will explore the options and potentially make recommendations.\nMoreover, as specified in the draft, the intent at this point is merely to allow users a voluntary choice to self-declare addresses. The E.U. representatives confirmed that there are as of yet no plans to make non-declaration illegal. The representatives suggested that users may choose to self-declare their addresses, however, in order to increase the credibility and use of virtual currencies, as their anonymous nature can be seen as a threat.\nThe legislative proposal is currently in the preliminary discussion phase; there may still be modifications at both the European Parliament and the European Council levels. At least one initiative, coming from the Netherlands, has been started to adjust the proposal, most importantly removing KYC/AML requirements for wallet providers.", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 3}

The announcement indicated the growing interest of Alibaba in distributed ledger technology.\nNow, it appears that the Chinese giant is gradually committing to the blockchain. Ant Financial, the Alibaba company that operates Alipay, is using distributed ledgers to transparently record transactions and improve the accountability of Chinese philanthropic organizations, Bloomberg Technology reports.\nAnt Financial dominates the online payments market in China through its Alipay service, which has more than 450 million annual active users and has been compared to PayPal. Credit Suisse estimates that that 58 percent of China\u2019s online payment transactions go through Alipay. The company also operates a money-market fund called Yu\u2019e Bao and an online bank called MYbank.The name Ant refers to the small merchants \u2014 myriads of hardworking ants \u2014 who sell goods through Alibaba, The Wall Street Journal explains.\nAnt Financial was spun off as a stand-alone company before the $25 billion Alibaba initial public offering in 2014 and is expected to launch its own IPO. The company completed a new $4.5 billion funding round in April as reported by The Financial Times, giving it a valuation of roughly $60 billion, according to China Business News, a respected daily newspaper that is part-owned by Alibaba. The new investors include high-profile state-owned Chinese corporations such as a unit of China Investment Corp. (CIC), the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and a subsidiary of China Construction Bank, the country\u2019s second-largest lender by assets.\n\u201cWe hope to bring more transparency to charity and blockchain technology\u2019s decentralized nature fits that purpose well,\u201d said Ant Financial CTO Cheng Li. \u201cIt means that all the information and transaction history of funds will be more reliable and can\u2019t be easily tampered with.\u201d\nThe China Social Assistance Foundation is one of the first large Chinese charities to join the project.\nCheng explained that donors on \u201cAnt Love\u201d \u2014 the charity platform operated by the company \u2014 will be able to track transaction histories and gain a clearer understanding of where their funds go and how they\u2019re used. According to the Ant Financial executive, that makes it tougher to alter records and may help restore some of the trust that\u2019s been squandered over the years. In fact, though philanthropy is growing fast in China, numerous scandals have undermined the donors\u2019 confidence and trust.\nCheng added that Ant Financial is using a private blockchain for the project and plans to open up the ledger to charity organizations and auditors in the future. It seems plausible that Ant Financial has chosen philanthropy, a non-controversial and socially important application, for its first projects with distributed ledger technology before moving on to business-relevant and potentially very profitable applications such as payments and remittances.\nIn this case, Ant Financial \u2014 a fast-growing subsidiary of one of the world\u2019s largest tech giants, expected to become a high-profile public corporation itself \u2014 would give a significant boost to the distributed ledgers in the mainstream business world.\nBitGive Foundation\u2019s Ongoing Charity 2.0 Initiative: Donation Transparency Platform on the Bitcoin Blockchain\nAnt Financial\u00a0is not the first to try to improve transparency in charitable giving. The BitGive Foundation, a U.S. 501(c)(3) nonprofit whose mission is to \u201crevolutionize global philanthropy through technology,\u201d announced\u00a0BitGive\u2019s Charity 2.0 Initiative: Donation Transparency Platform\u00a0for donors and nonprofits using Bitcoin's blockchain technology in 2015.\n\u201cIt is interesting and exciting to see entities like Ant Financial and Jack Ma\u2019s Alibaba Group looking at blockchain technology,\u201d \u00a0BitGive Founder and Executive Director Connie Gallippi said to Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cTheir desire to develop a charity project focused on transparency is certainly great testament to BitGive\u2019s Charity 2.0 Initiative: Donation Transparency Platform, which we have been developing for over a year. BitGive\u2019s platform has been widely supported by the Bitcoin and Blockchain community and has received grants and other financial support from philanthropic entities, including the Walter and Karla Goldschmidt Foundation.\u201d\nAccording to the BitGive website, the new platform will revolutionize philanthropy by allowing donors and the public to trace nonprofit transactions on a public platform in real time, to track the funds until they reach their final destination and to see how the donations are spent. BitGive\u2019s platform also has a donor-experience focus that ties donor contributions to direct results on the ground so donors will not only know how and where their donation funds were spent, they will also see the impact and results first-hand from their contributions.\nGallippi also noted that a key distinguishing principle for BitGive\u2019s Donation Transparency Platform is that it is built on the public and widely-accepted Bitcoin blockchain, rather than on a private blockchain, \u201cproviding true public transparency and accountability on an immutable ledger that is housed on a distributed global infrastructure.\u201d\nBitGive\u2019s MVP (minimum viable product) will be released within the next month or so, says Gallippi, showcasing charity partners who have elected to be demonstration use cases, including those using cross-border transactions for projects in developing countries. The platform will also incorporate administrative and data analysis features for charities to use in reporting and auditing. \u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 2}

The blockchain is taking the role of some of these intermediaries. So it's making the process easier, cheaper and cross-border.\u201d\nOver the last year, Funderbeam has helped angel investors and entrepreneurs discover, benchmark and analyze startups, using data from services such as AngelList and CrunchBase.\u00a0\nFunderbeam has raised $2 million from investors to date and has an extensive data platform with information on more than 150,000 startups. The company\u2019s website includes a detailed listing of new companies looking for funding, including how much has been raised to date as well as their funding goals and timeline.\nFunderbeam plans to take a 3 percent commission from successful ventures and may introduce trading fees in the future.\nNasdaq has led the way in developing blockchain technology for trading platforms with its Linq project and is currently working with Estonia\u2019s Tallinn Stock Exchange. \u00a0Other exchanges developing or looking at applying blockchain include Deutsche Borse and the Australian Securities Exchange.", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 16}

There was no intention to come to a sort of agreement like the one that was made in Hong Kong earlier this year. The goal was to strengthen the unity between these two segments of the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nWhile obvious topics, such as mining decentralization and progress for hard and soft forks, were discussed over the past few days, the participants in the gathering also had an open discussion with Professor Dan Boneh at Stanford and answered questions from Google employees at their campus.\n\u201cWe think that Bitcoin's strength comes from the consensus of its participants,\u201d said those who attended the gathering via a group statement. \u201cMany of us plan to attend Scaling Bitcoin 3 in Milan, Italy, and everyone would like to continue with gatherings like these and others in the future with all parts of the Bitcoin ecosystem.

During the presentation, Boneh discussed a private form of proof-of-solvency for Bitcoin custodians and exchanges. According to Boneh, this scheme would allow exchanges to prove their solvency without revealing their Bitcoin addresses, total holdings or liabilities, or any information about their customers.\n\u201cIt's a chicken-egg problem. Customers aren't demanding it, so ... someone needs to be the first one to step up and do it,\u201d added Boneh. The method of proving solvency is outlined in a paper from last year, which lists Boneh as a co-author.\nIn addition to proof-of-solvency, Boneh discussed Schnorr signatures and other possible improvements for Bitcoin.\nWhy Weren\u2019t Exchanges and Wallet Providers Invited?\nOne of the common questions among those who were not invited to the gathering has been related to the lack of participation from exchanges and wallet providers.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin's block reward halved for the second time last week, from 25 to 12.5 bitcoins. The event, commonly referred to as \u201cthe halving\u201d (or sometimes: \u201cthe halvening\u201d), was a key moment in Bitcoin's history. Such halvings are scheduled to occur once in about every four years, and they ensure that no more than 21 million bitcoins will ever be in circulation.\nUnsurprisingly, the halving was highly anticipated, and predictions on how the event would impact the Bitcoin ecosystem abounded.\nOne week since the second halving, this is the aftermath.\nPrice\nPerhaps the most debated issue leading up to the halving concerned Bitcoin\u2019s exchange rate. As Bitcoin's price is based on supply and demand,\u00a0some\u00a0thought\u00a0a cut in supply would naturally lead to an increase in price. But since the halving did not come as a surprise,\u00a0others\u00a0expected the market to have anticipated the supply cut, and would have already priced it in.\u00a0Others\u00a0believed that an anticipation of a price increase could actually have resulted in a bit of a bubble, and therefore expected a fall in price.\nNow, one week after the halving, it's clear the price has not moved substantially \u2013 at least not by such an extent that it is obvious the halving is the cause of it. Hovering around $675, compared to about $650 at the time of halving, the exchange rate did increase by a couple percentage points. But that\u2019s not unusual for Bitcoin.\nIt can, however, be argued that the price increase as a result of the halving did occur in anticipation of the event \u2012 that the halving was indeed anticipated and calculated in. Bitcoin's exchange rate rose about 50 percent (from $430) in the three months ahead of the halving, and even more than doubled (from $300) compared to a year ago.\nAnd, of course, how the halving will affect Bitcoin's price in the near future remains to be seen.\nAs an interesting detail, the moments leading up to the halving itself did see some increased volatility. In the hour before the first \u201c12.5 Bitcoin block\u201d was mined, Bitcoin's exchange rate dropped more than $30, almost 5 percent, from about $660 to $630. It stabilized to around $650 at time of the halving itself.\nHash Rate\nSince the block reward is the main source of income for Bitcoin miners (and Bitcoin mining itself comes at a significant cost), many expected to see a drop in hash rate after the halving. Some predicted the hash rate could drop by up to 50 percent, proportional to the drop in block reward. But even more conservative estimates \u2013 by some of the\u00a0most\u00a0prominent\u00a0mining pool operators, for example \u2013 predicted a slight drop of 5 to 10 percent, or perhaps no drop at all.\nAs it turns out, hash rate\u00a0hardly dropped\u00a0at all. Current estimates suggest that total hash rate has decreased only by about one percent \u2013 or less. And since Bitcoin mining is inherently a game of chance, this slight loss may even be due to variance (\u201cluck\u201d). (This, of course, also means the drop could in reality be slightly more than a single percent.)\nNeither does the halving seem to have resulted in significant changes in the Bitcoin mining landscape. While there have been slight shifts in the size of different mining pools, none of these are out of bounds with expected variance. (In this case, BW Mining and Slush Pool seem to have found more blocks this week compared to the week before, while BitFury found a bit fewer. Asked by\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine, BitFury acknowledged it has not switched off any mining gear, and supposedly is just having a slight unlucky streak.)\nThat said, it should be noted that one ASIC-producer and mining pool KnCMiner\u00a0declared bankruptcy\u00a0last May in anticipation of the halving. (Daniel Masters, who runs a New Jersey-based Bitcoin hedge fund, isreported\u00a0to have bought a part of KnCMiner's business, which may explain why the pool seems to still mine blocks.)\nStability\nThe most worrying predictions concerned the stability of the Bitcoin network itself.\u00a0Several\u00a0prominent\u00a0Bitcoiners\u00a0worried\u00a0that a sudden drop in income could lead to many miners shutting down their hardware. The resulting drop in hash rate, and subsequent slowdown of block creation, could cause the network to become congested, they warned. In a worst-case scenario, they worried, this could even lead to downward spiral of decreased usability, a falling exchange rate, and, therefore, even more miners shutting down.\nAnother\u00a0described\u00a0threat concerned an increased risk of a 51 percent attack. In this scenario, the reduction in mining reward could knock miners off the network, resulting in an even more centralized mining landscape. This would open up the possibility of miners blocking or even reversing transactions.\nOf course, since neither hash rate (nor price) dropped much at all, the downward spiral-scenario did not play out at all. The Bitcoin network is chugging along at a regular pace, with miners mining blocks and confirming transactions as if nothing happened.\nAnd while it seems the share of hash power controlled by major mining pools concentrated in China did increase by a couple of percentages since the halving, there is \u2013 again \u2013 no reason to think this actually had anything to do with the halving; it could very well be variance.\u00a0\nAdditionally, there is little reason to think risks of a 51 percent attack have increased along with it. The three biggest mining pools were already responsible for more than half of all hash power on the network; that has not changed after the halving. (Whether and how big of a risk that presents is a different debate \u2013 and beyond the scope of this article.)", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 18}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nEthereum Classic is dominating the cryptocurrency news cycle. After a slumber of some days following the Ethereum hard fork that refunded investors of the raided\u00a0DAO, the unforked and re-named Ethereum blockchain and its native token classic ether (ETC) surged. Exchanges enabled trade in the digital currency, investors bought in, miners pointed their hardware to it, and a new development community began to form.\nBut Ethereum Classic also has led to chaos and uncertainty. The forked half of the chain \u2014 sometimes dubbed \u201cEthereum One,\u201d and supported by the Ethereum Foundation \u2014 is still running as well. Ethereum has, therefore, effectively split into two networks: an unprecedented situation in the cryptocurrency space.\nThe question on everybody's mind is, therefore: How will this end?\nIn this three-part series, Bitcoin Magazine provides an overview of some of the scenarios that circulate throughout the different Ethereum communities and the wider blockchain industry.\nPart 1 of this series covered how the great Ethereum schism can end relatively well for Ethereum One (but not so much for Ethereum Classic.) Part 2 covered how the great Ethereum schism can end relatively well for Ethereum Classic (but not so much for Ethereum One.)\nIn Part 3: How the great Ethereum schism can end relatively badly for both Ethereum Classic and Ethereum One.\nAuthor\u2019s note: Not all scenarios or nuances may be accounted for, nor does inclusion in this list \u2014 or the order of it \u2014 say anything about likelihood.\nScenario 7: Ethereum Classic and Ethereum One Destroy Each Other\nThe seventh scenario is mostly attributed to (potential) adversaries of Ethereum \u2014 some have suggested adversaries from the Bitcoin-space. In this scenario, Ethereum Classic and Ethereum One engage in a sort of battle to the death that neither survives.\nThis could happen most obviously by technical failure. Replay attacks \u2014 transactions copied from one chain onto the other \u2014 already caused significant chaos. Perhaps other, so far undiscovered vulnerabilities, will be revealed soon.\nBut at this point, social failure scenarios may be a bigger threat.\nOne failure mode could result from a scenario where Ethereum Classic overtakes Ethereum One. It's not unthinkable that this would disincentivize Ethereum's most prolific developers to the point of quitting; especially if they sold their classic ether. And if not many new developers fill that gap, development may grind to a halt, potentially spelling the beginning of the end for both sides of the chain.\nAnother failure scenario is not unlike a potential failure scenario resulting from a contentious hard fork in Bitcoin. As explained by BitTorrent inventor Bram Cohen on Quora:\n\u201cBitcoin the technical gizmo is very good at one particular thing: Answering the question 'what is the current state of balances?' with very strong consensus among everybody doing the answering. That isn't going to change. What Bitcoin the technical gizmo can't solve is answering the question 'What is Bitcoin?' The biggest immediate threat to Bitcoin is the potential creation of a multitude of hard forks, resulting in the whole thing collapsing in a mess of incompatible squabbling with no agreement over what the 'real' Bitcoin is.\u201d\nEthereum Classic and Ethereum One do seem to be co-existing relatively peacefully so far. Both have their own name, their own currency, their own community, and more.\nBut this may change.\nIt may change if Ethereum Classic overtakes Ethereum One. A growing number of Ethereum Classic users may at that point logically (at least from their point of view) claim to be the real Ethereum, while the Ethereum One community may do the same.\nIt may also change through the legal system. At one point, a judge may have to decide which Ethereum is the real Ethereum. This could open up another can of worms \u2014 not in the least because the Ethereum protocol itself is sometimes claimed to be \u201cabove the law.\u201d Not to mention that different courts in different jurisdictions might come to different opinions.\nAnd these are only the two most obvious scenarios. There is probably a near-endless number of reasons for a divided community to \u201cend up in a mess of incompatible squabbling.\u201d\nScenario 8: Both Ethereum Versions Become Obsolete\nThis is the scenario expected by the permissioned blockchain-crowd and the \u201cBitcoin Maximalists\u201d \u2014 just for completely different reasons.\nFor the permissioned blockchain-crowd, the Ethereum split is evidence that an open, permissionless cyrptocurrency-like system with no authority cannot offer a long-term value proposition. The future of this technology, they maintain, lies in adaptations that are better suited to exist within the current legal and financial systems, where responsibility is much better defined. Ethereum-like systems have no place in that future \u2014 they think.\nBitcoin Maximalists, meanwhile, believe there can be an open, permissionless cryptocurrency-like system with no authority \u2014 but only one: Bitcoin. They maintain there's very little reason for any altcoins to have any long-term value; Bitcoin has the largest network effect and the most security, and they see in the coin-split a confirmation that Bitcoin has the best development community and most resilient infrastructure. Moreover, they maintain that most, if not all, useful futures from altcoins can be copied onto Bitcoin, either on the protocol level or as a sidechain. That includes Ethereum-like features. Rootstock, an Ethereum-like sidechain, is currently in development. And some Ethereum-like apps can already be applied as specific sidechains (such as Namecoin).\nFor Bitcoin Maximalists, therefore, all altcoins \u2014 including both versions of Ethereum \u2014 serve as testbeds for innovation at best, or pump-and-dump scams at worst. And Ethereum Classic and Ethereum One will do that equally well.", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 31}

A second man, Pascal Reid, was also arrested. Reid has since been sentenced to probation for operating as an unlicensed money broker.\nThe State had initially charged Espinoza as operating as an unauthorized \u201cmoney transmitter,\u201d but later amended the term to \u201ca payment instrument seller.\u201d A payment instrument, strictly speaking, refers to \u201ca check, draft, warrant money order, traveler\u2019s check, electronic instrument or...monetary value whether or not negotiable.\u201d\nAccording to Pooler, \u201cBitcoin does not fall under the statutory definition of \u2018payment instrument\u2019...nor does Bitcoin fit into one of the defined categories listed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt this time...attempting to fit the sale of Bitcoin into a statutory scheme regulating money services businesses is like fitting a square peg in a round hole.\u201d\n\nThe judge then dismissed the money laundering charges, declaring that under the current regulations of the state, Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are not considered money.\n\u201cThe Court is not an expert in economics, however, it is very clear, even to someone with limited knowledge in the area, that Bitcoin has a long way to go before it the equivalent of money,\u201d a section of Pooler\u2019s order read.\nPooler further noted that the case was too vague to apply to a digital currency, and explained that the court cannot punish the defendant for selling his property to another.\n\u201cThis court is unwilling to punish a man for selling his property to another, when his actions fall under a statute that is so vaguely written that even legal professionals have difficulty finding a singular meaning,\u201d she stated.\nThe case, which was closely observed by the Bitcoin community since the first hearing on May 27, is said to be the first prosecution to define the legality of Bitcoin in the United States. This digital currency-related money-laundering case garnered extra interest since defense witness Charles Evans, a Barry University economics professor, was paid $3,000 worth of Bitcoin for his testimony.\nEvans told the court that under state law Bitcoin is closer to a property than an actual coin because of the digital currency\u2019s lack of dependence on a centralized or public authority. Comparing the action to trading\u00a0\u201cpoker chips,\u201d Evans made the case that dealing in Bitcoin is simply bartering.\nPooler\u00a0stated, \u201cThis is the most fascinating thing I\u2019ve heard in this courtroom in a long time.\u201d\nBitcoin, which is considered an intangible asset in many countries, including Canada, Australia and Croatia, is still not considered a legal currency in most regions around the world, including the United States. While many countries around the world haven\u2019t establish a proper regulatory framework for the digital currency, the Miami-Dade money-laundering case concludes that Bitcoin is not considered a legal currency in the United States.", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 25}

The ETI, defined as a UCITS-eligible, asset-backed security whose value and the related performance is linked to the underlying asset (Bitcoin) collateralized in a segregated cell, can be purchased by suitable investors through their usual brokers, with a minimum investment of \u20ac100,000, a management fee of 1.75 percent, and two days settlement via Clearstream/Euroclear.\nThe BitcoinETI issuers express confidence that the value of Bitcoin could grow exponentially over the coming years, and invite portfolio managers seeking alternative assets to consider the digital currency as a way to diversify their investments and boost their performance.\nThe announcement notes that the new Bitcoin ETI forms part of a series of early initiatives aimed at establishing Gibraltar as a virtual currency hub. There are other virtual currency hubs in Europe, most notably the Isle of Man \u2014 and arguably\u00a0the whole U.K. \u2014 but Gibraltar could become especially interesting in the future. In fact, the tiny region \u2014 a British overseas territory geographically located in mainland Spain and a major point of contention in Anglo-Spanish relations \u2014 has established itself as an online gambling and financial services center, and could become an important U.K.-E.U. interface after Brexit.\n\u201cWe continue to work with the private sector and our regulator on an appropriate regulatory environment for operators in the digital currency space, and the launch of this ETI on our stock exchange demonstrates our ability to be innovative and deliver speed to market,\u201d said Gibraltar\u2019s Minister for Financial Services and Gaming, Albert Isola. \u201cI am delighted to welcome BitcoinETI to Gibraltar and congratulate GSX and Argentarius on this initiative.\u201d\nRevoltura hinted at plans to introduce and list further digital currency and disruptive technology instruments in the near future.", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 26}

As per what seemed to be the popular demand, the protocol rules have been updated incompatibly with the existing Ethereum protocol. Users have essentially moved to a new blockchain and left the old one behind. At time of publication, well over 90 percent of hash power on the Ethereum network had moved to the new chain. This fork effectively reverts the existence of the DAO and will reclaim almost all funds taken by an attacker a month ago, to return them to the original investors.\nBut the hard fork also marks the launch of a spin-off\u00a0project:\u00a0Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic continues on the existing Ethereum blockchain and has not implemented the hard fork code to \u201cundo\u201d the DAO. According to the project's website, this is because \u201cEthereum Classic intends to keep the original censorship-resistant Ethereum going\u201d and \u201cprovide an alternative for people who strongly disagree with DAO bailout.\u201d\nWhile Ethereum Classic to many seems to be a bit of a joke, intended to make a point, the project has been gaining some traction, with a small-but-growing user-base on\u00a0Reddit and\u00a0Slack, and with the decentralized exchange\u00a0Bitsquare offering its token \u2014 classic ether \u2014 as a trading option. Additionally, some 0.5 percent of hash power joined a special Ethereum Classic mining pool even before the split, and seems determined to mine on the Ethereum Classic chain, ensuring blocks are mined and the project is kept alive.\nEthereum Classic's project coordinator goes by the name \u201carvicco\u201d and prefers to remain pseudonymous because in Russia, where he lives, \u201cthe legal situation around crypto is fluid and uncertain.\u201d Arvicco is also the owner of\u00a0BitNovosti.com, the biggest crypto media outlet in the Russian language area, which runs a news site, a YouTube channel, does film production, and more.\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to arvicco to learn more of his intentions.\nArvicco, are you a troll?\nNope.

This is an initiative that started on Russian-language forums; probably among a couple dozen active miners, traders and developers working in different aspects of crypto-tech, and more. We felt something needed to be done, and nobody else seemed to be doing it. Now, people from all over the world are joining us.\nBetween ourselves we have all necessary skills to make the transition from Ethereum to Ethereum Classic happen. My skills are in communications, which is why I'm the most visible, at least in the English-speaking part of the crypto-world.\nAs for why we want to allow the DAO hacker to move his coins... It\u2019s an interesting question, and was [the] subject of heated debate in the Bitcoin community for years. We know the Bitcoin addresses of some dark markets, like the Silk Road and its descendants. Why not just blacklist or filter those coins? Why not block funds resulting from the Mt. Gox hack, or other well-documented hacks, thefts and so on?\nMany of us are supporters of a\u00a0radical crypto-decentralist stance. In short, we believe blockchain-systems should always adhere to three characteristics: openness, neutrality, and immutability. Without these characteristics, a blockchain is nothing but a glorified database. And there's no value in such a database; neither from a social nor from a technological perspective.\nBy bailing out the DAO, the Ethereum Foundation is attempting to reach a shortsighted goal of \u201cmaking investors whole\u201d and \u201cboosting confidence in Ethereum platform.\u201d But they're doing quite the opposite. Bailing out the DAO undermines two of the three key long-term value propositions of the Ethereum platform.\nMany would argue that the DAO is an exceptional case and that Ethereum is still very much in its early days. Why can't a hard fork undo the damage and be a one-time only event?\nYes, a lot of people in the community falsely believe that this can be a \u201cone-off thing.\u201d That we can just violate Ethereum's long-term value proposition \u201ca little bit,\u201d and we\u2019ll be fine. But that\u2019s not how it works.\nA blockchain is either neutral \u2014 censorship-resistant \u2014 or it\u2019s not. A blockchain is either immutable \u2013 preserving one universally accepted version of history, one immutable sequence of events \u2014 or it\u2019s not. It\u2019s impossible to be \u201ca little bit mutable by democratic process.\u201d It\u2019s impossible to be \u201ccensorship-resistant, until someone very important loses lots of investors money.\u201d\nIt\u2019s impossible to be \u201ca little bit pregnant.\u201d\nOnce the precedent is set, it will be so much easier to make another bailout when \u2014 not \u201cif,\u201d when \u2014 another big smart contract [failure] happens. It will also be so much easier for external institutions \u2014 like courts, law enforcement, or governments \u2014 to impose their rules, once the precedent of censorship, funds confiscation and 'crime prevention' is set.\nWhere do we draw the line?\nEthereum is a consensus protocol. If users, by consensus, decide to change the rules, why shouldn\u2019t the rules be changed? Why can\u2019t the line be wherever users want it to be?\nWell, according to different metrics, 20 to 40 percent of the Ethereum community is against the hard fork. And that minority mostly disagrees on principle.\nSo there is a majority in favor of a hard fork, by a democratic process, if you will. I don't deny that. But such a democratic process is problematic. It is easily gamed to shape the results to the liking of those who wield power. It doesn\u2019t protect vital rights of the minorities. I can go on; Hans-Hermann Hoppe is your friend.\nThe point is: We shouldn't want to replicate the problems of democracy in Ethereum, nor in any other blockchain for that matter.\nYet, that is the nature of this technology. If 60 to 80 percent of users want to hard fork, they can hard fork.\nYes, users can choose to adhere to any rules they want to adhere to. Even in Bitcoin. The only thing preventing a simple code change that eliminates the 21 million bitcoin emission limit is the Bitcoin community itself.\nBut people self-select communities. And as long as people self-select into communities that uphold their values, it will work. Virtually anyone who chose to join the Bitcoin community knew about the 21 million bitcoin limit, and therefore supports it. It's this social consensus that's very hard to break, thereby keeping the 21 million limit in place.\nObviously, Ethereum's values were not articulated well enough. Probably because in the beginning members of the project wanted to be very inclusive. As a result, the community ended up without any of the guiding principles to assess what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong in regard to the DAO debate.\nIn full, as stated on our website: \u201cWe believe in decentralized, censorship-resistant, permissionless blockchains. We believe in the original vision of Ethereum as a world computer you can't shut down, running irreversible smart contracts. We believe in a strong separation of concerns, where system forks are only possible in order to correct actual platform bugs, not to bail out failed contracts and special interests. We believe in censorship-resistant platform that can be actually trusted \u2014 by anyone.\u201d\nPutting aside the DAO, for the moment, do you think that the values held by other people in the Ethereum community differ fundamentally from these values?\u00a0\nIt seems that too many people in the community currently uphold a bit of a \u201cget-rich-quick-regardless-of-the-consequences\u201d value. An influx of such people coincided with the great price run-up. And that is very unfortunate, in my opinion. It\u2019s very hard to make people understand principles when their \u201ccrypto-fortune\u201d depends on them not understanding them. Or at least they think that's what their \u201ccrypto-fortune\u201d depends on.\nIsn\u2019t there a moral argument to be made that the community should undo a theft when there is the chance to do so?\nWhat a noble sentiment! Are they going to reverse all the thefts on their blockchain?\nIf so, who is going to decide what on-chain code execution is \u201ctheft,\u201d and what's not? Where is the body of law? Who is going to be the police, the judge and the jury? What is the appeal procedure?\nIf not, why not? Why does this theft get a special treatment, and the other theft not? Who do you need to know, whose buddy [do] you need to be to make it happen? How are they going to defend such a change of stance against precedent and subpoenas?\nAs mentioned, if the answer to these questions is this vague concept of \u201cconsensus,\u201d or rather, a democratic process, that's no satisfying answer at all.\nIt's this whole snake's nest that you avoid cleanly when you stick to principles. But you have to sacrifice something for principles sometimes, yes. A failed investment into unproven and insecure smart contract, perhaps?\nAre you claiming that Ethereum users in favor of a hard fork lack principles?\nFrom my point of view, the Ethereum Foundation became co-opted by special interests. People who are connected with the DAO invested a lot of money into the DAO and have a very close relationship with Ethereum Foundation insiders.\nImmediately after the DAO crisis, Stephan Tual \u2014 one of the guys behind the DAO \u2014 and people connected to Stephan Tual started running a political campaign to justify the DAO bailout by any means necessary. Even though it runs contrary to everything Ethereum initially proclaimed to stand for: \u201cCode is Law,\u201d Ethereum as this trusted platform for smart contracts free from the human factor, and all that.\nThe problem is, his campaign was very successful. Because too many Ethereum users, developers, traders and others also bought into the DAO.\nThere is concern about the health of the Ethereum platform. How do you respond to the argument that it the DAO attacker gets to move his funds, he might very well want to sell them off and crash the price in the process?\nAny token price is the result of a balance of supply and demand. If the attacker dumps his coins, it would create a one-off supply shock.\u00a0\nIn fact, I expect an even bigger supply-shock for classic ether after we split, as pro-fork people dump their coins. That's fine. Some people will see it as an opportunity to accumulate tokens \u2014 either because they believe that our vision of Ethereum platform has better chances, or just to diversify their bets on a future smart contract platform. There are many reasons.\nIt\u2019s all right for the coin price to fluctuate \u2014 this is how markets balance themselves. It creates opportunities for investors and traders.\nIf the price dumps too much, might the tokens have too little value for miners to invest the hash power required to secure the chain?\nDifficulty adjustment is quite fast in Ethereum. Now, about an hour after the hard fork, it seems the initial difficulty adjustment to get back to the norm of two blocks per minute will happen in hours \u2014 maybe days. Not weeks or months. After that, any adjustment will be easy.\nMeasured in hash power, the Ethereum Classic chain will probably not be as secure as the Ethereum chain \u2014 at least not right from the start. But why would any miner want to attack it? The incentives line up for miners to just mine fairly and earn classic ether in the process.\nDo you think that miners who support Ethereum and the hard fork might want to attack Ethereum Classic in order to make ensure that only one chain survives the hard fork?\nWhy would they mind decreased competition on their own chain?\nCould the existence of Ethereum Classic be detrimental to Ethereum and the price of ether?\nI don\u2019t think so. I've seen people express such opinions, but many more actually think it\u2019s a good idea. If there is a minority that wants to go separate ways, why not let it do so?\nEven some pro-fork people expressed Ethereum Classic in terms of an \u201cinsurance policy for Ethereum.\u201d If the Ethereum Foundation's approach ultimately fails, it would be easier if there is an alternative to fall back to.\nThe other problem is that Ethereum plans to move to a proof-of-stake system in the future. That may not be secure if the attacker holds 5 percent of all coins, for example. Should this be an area for concern?\nI don't foresee any problems if the attacker keeps his coins going into proof-of-stake, and\u00a0neither does Vitalik Buterin.\nIf the attacker is going to dump his coins, as many contend, then what's the \u201cproblem\u201d at all?\nWhat about the split itself? Can it be done securely?\nIt\u2019s hard to say at this point whether the hard fork split will go smoothly or not. The Ethereum Foundation developers are great, but the hard fork code was unduly rushed and has some issues. The network split could be done in a cleaner way. Now there is a risk of a so-called \u201creplay attack,\u201d where transactions can be replayed from one chain to another.\nBut there are some\u00a0mitigation strategies. We are going to focus on the issues that require the least user involvement, to make it easy for everyone. The Ethereum Foundation and outside developers are helping with that as well.\nYou claim to have a solid user-base in the Russian-speaking part of the crypto-community. What about the rest of the world?\nWell, there is something very interesting about Ethereum Classic. Essentially, this is an Ethereum \u201cspin-off coin.\u201d Spin-off coins were theorized for a while, but there's been no widely known attempt to make them so far.\nIt means that Ethereum Classic will immediately have a wide user-base: all the current Ethereum users. Some of them will see the value of transacting on a censorship-resistant chain, some won't. This creates interesting arbitrage opportunities for smart traders. And since Bitsquare will offer trading in classic ether, we'll have a market.\nAdditionally, all major ether exchanges \u2014 Poloniex, Bitfinex, and Kraken \u2014 are going to give their users both ether and classic ether after the fork. So all their users are going to have both deposited into their accounts. And once these exchanges see that Ethereum Classic is alive and kicking, allowing trade in already deposited customer funds is a no-brainer.\nAnd, of course, all applications that run on Ethereum will run on Ethereum Classic just as well. That's the whole point.\nWhat about developers? To date, none of the well-known Ethereum developers is joining Ethereum Classic.\nAt the initial stage, maintaining 100 percent compatibility with Ethereum is a high priority for us. This also means that we don't really need to do much development, we simply fork the code from the Ethereum repository and update accordingly.\nBut, of course, if current Ethereum developers want to join us \u2014 now or in the future \u2014 they are more than welcome to do so. We are aiming for the same thing here: building a better future for humankind, where smart contract platforms provide a mechanism for social and economic cooperation on a truly global scale.\nDo you want to eventually \u201cbeat\u201d Ethereum? Or can Ethereum Classic and Ethereum exist side by side?\nI don\u2019t want to slip into confrontational rhetoric. While I\u2019m highly critical of how the Ethereum Foundation handled this issue and do think that they are making a grave mistake which undermines the long-term value proposition of their platform, I have high regard for most members of the Foundation, the community and developers.\nI know that many developers are also very critical of this hard fork. But they acted responsibly, creating the hard fork code and giving the Ethereum community a choice. Well, we now intend to realize this choice.\nEthereum Classic is not some kind of \u201canti-Ethereum,\u201d as some are trying to misrepresent us. We are part of a broader Ethereum ecosystem, and we intend to contribute positively to its development. We are just another Ethereum community that shares a different set of values, and that we believe may eventually deliver on the original promise and vision of an open, neutral and immutable blockchain. We are making the Ethereum ecosystem richer, not poorer.\nNow we just need people to understand that this project is not some kind of joke. We're for real.", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 20}

The German multinational company, a market leader in enterprise application software and a legend in the enterprise computing world, announced that it collaborated with digital fintech company Ripple and two banks, ATB Financial in Canada and ReiseBank in Germany, to demonstrate how banks can improve the efficiency of cross-border payments by using blockchain technology.\nWorking with a team at ATB Financial, SAP and Ripple designed and built a proof-of-concept prototype based on blockchain technology. The prototype was used to send a test CAD $1,000 payment from ATB Financial to ReiseBank. According to the SAP press release, the payment, which would typically have taken between two to six business days to process because of requirements such as settling with the counterparty bank and reconciling accounts, was completed in around 20 seconds.\nUsing blockchain technology for efficient, fast and cheap cross-border payments is nothing new. What is interesting here is the involvement of SAP. With 78,000 employees, 310,000 corporate customers worldwide and a 2015 annual revenue of \u20ac20.8 billion, the company is the world\u2019s third largest independent software manufacturer based on market capitalization. SAP has long been considered the embodiment of German quality and solid, no-nonsense enterprise computing for large firms.\n\u201cATB stepped up as a relatively early adopter of digital in the banking world,\u201d Kris Hansen, senior principal, industry value engineering - financial services, \u200eSAP Canada, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cBy 2011 the bank had already moved from legacy systems to a digital core. This paved the way for a level of speed and innovation less forward-thinking banks could only dream of. The blockchain demo is the latest example of how that early investment is paying off, and how ATB is prepared for a future led by digital forces. It\u2019s also evidence of what digitally-ready banks and fintechs can do if they team up.\u201d\nThe technology prototype connects SAP HANA Cloud, the open platform as a service from SAP, and the SAP Payment Engine application, which centralizes payment processing in one solution, with Ripple\u2019s network. For the demonstration, SAP provided a mobile user interface through which the payment was executed.\nRipple\u2019s distributed financial technology allows for banks around the world to directly transact with each other without the need for a central counterparty or correspondent. Ripple\u2019s solution is built around a decentralized network that offers a cryptographically secure end-to-end payment flow with instant transaction verification. According to the company, 12 of the top 50 banks are working with Ripple.\nATB Financial is the largest Alberta-based financial institution, with assets of $46.8 billion. In 2011, the bank migrated its entire legacy banking system to a major new core system built using SAP solutions, making it one of the largest SAP deployments in North American banking.\n\u201cAlthough we are very much still in the early stages of blockchain adoption, it was highly encouraging to see in a true demonstration the potential it has in transforming cross-border payments, making them almost instantaneous and reducing potential errors,\u201d said Curtis Stange, chief strategy and operations officer, ATB Financial. \u201cUsing SAP HANA Cloud Platform, we\u2019re able to experiment and be nimble with emerging innovations like blockchain. The next stage for us, working with SAP and Ripple, will be to understand how the front-end experience should work for the benefit of our customers.\u201d\nA recent company communication reveals that SAP is working with multiple customers to explore how blockchain technology can support numerous processes, including shared ledger payments and trading capabilities. The company is looking at concepts, technologies, existing implementations, partnerships and future product integrations that will allow SAP to help its customers understand the role that blockchain could play in their business.\n\u201cWhile Bitcoin may have been a flash-in-the-pan technology, it has given the financial world a new way to look at its architecture and systems with blockchain,\u201d said Raimund Gross, solution architect and futurist at SAP. \u201cAs this space evolves throughout the next few years and more banks integrate blockchain into their overarching operations, one thing is certain \u2012 the possibilities are endless.\u201d\u00a0\nHowever, according to Gross, technologists need to translate the blockchain technology concept into specific business value messages spelling out the advantages and benefits for departments by process and by industry.\n\u201cBanks like ATB that take a positive and proactive approach to blockchain now can position themselves advantageously for when the technology enters the mainstream,\u201d concluded Bernd Leukert, member of the SAP Executive Board. \u201cATB\u2019s blockchain transaction underscores the value of running a business on a full-fledged digital core so it can react quickly to emerging possibilities and avoid the threat of disruption.\u201d\n", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 18}

In fact, while payment and financial applications of distributed ledger technology are relatively well established in Europe and the English speaking world, new applications beyond finance, such as smart contracts, e-voting and the Internet-of-Things (IoT) as well as new markets such as (the potentially huge) Chinese market, are likely to attract more interest and investments in the coming year.\nThe Moscow Exchange, formed in December 2011 by merging the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange (MICEX) and the Russian Trading System, is the largest exchange group in Russia; operating trading markets in equities, bonds, derivatives, the foreign exchange market, money markets and precious metals. The Moscow Exchange Group also operates the National Settlement Depository (NSD), Russia\u2019s central securities depository, and the country\u2019s largest clearing service provider (National Clearing Center).\nIn May, Bitcoin Magazine reported that the NSD developed and successfully tested an e-proxy voting system running on a distributed ledger built with the NXT distributed cryptographic platform.\n\u201cMoscow Exchange is excited to join the Hyperledger Project,\u201d said Sergei Poliakoff, CIO of Moscow Exchange. \u201cWe believe in the future impact of distributed ledger technologies for the whole financial industry.

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nThe Lightning Network is viewed by many in the Bitcoin community as the network\u2019s best hope for long-term scalability. The concept uses payment channels to perform bitcoin transactions off-chain, with the blockchain acting as a sort of backup court system for situations where someone decides not to play nice. The creators of this system for instant micropayments estimate that it could eventually be used to process billions of transactions per second.\nWhile a combination of smart contracts and game theory are used to make sure the system works properly for everyone, Bitcoin Core contributor, Peter Todd, explained a possible failure mode of the Lightning Network at the Bitcoin in Use conference late last month.\nEditor's note added at 1:11 EST:\u00a0The failure mode discussed in this article has been known since the early development of the Lightning Network and is discussed in the white paper. This article is not an attempt to give Peter Todd credit for discovery of the failure mode;\u00a0he simply provided\u00a0an overview of the issue during a recent talk.\nThe Lightning Network\u2019s Failure Mode\nThe Lightning Network failure scenario described by Todd, takes place when a large number of people on the Bitcoin network need to settle their Lightning Network disputes on the blockchain in a relatively short period of time.\n\u201cWe do have a failure mode which is: Imagine a whole bunch of these [settlements] have to happen at once,\u201d Todd explained. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much data that can go through the bitcoin network and if we had a large number of Lightning channels get closed out very rapidly, how are we going to get them all confirmed? At some point, you run out of capacity.\u201d\nIn a scenario where a large number of people need to settle their Lightning contracts on the blockchain, the price for doing so could increase substantially as the available space in bitcoin blocks becomes sparse. \u201cAt some point some people start losing out because the cost is just higher than what they can afford,\u201d Todd said. \u201cIf you have a very large percentage of the network using Lightning, potentially this cost is very high. Potentially, we could get this mass outbreak of failure.\u201d\nThe way the Lightning Network works, a user must be able to issue a breach remedy transaction in order to keep their counterparty honest. If a user is unable to make the proper transaction on the blockchain in a certain amount of time, their counterparty may be able to take control of bitcoins tied up in the smart contract between the two parties.\nWhat Are the Possible Solutions?\nAny situation that allows for coins to be stolen obviously needs to be avoided and according to Todd, there are some theoretical solutions available for this problem. For one, an adaptive block size limit could allow miners to increase capacity in these sorts of failure scenarios. Another possible solution would be to allow users of the Lightning Network to reserve space in future blocks to make sure they can broadcast a transaction on the blockchain before the expiration of a timelock.\nHaving said that, Todd indicated that a real, vetted solution is not available for this issue at this time. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole lot of complexity and we\u2019re not really at the point there where I could go and confidentially say, \u2018Yes, we\u2019re going to have the whole world buying coffees with these systems,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s tons more engineering to be done and I think it\u2019s going to be a slow process \u2012 figuring out how all this works.\u201d\nWhat Could Cause This Scenario?\nOne of the main reasons Todd is concerned about this disaster scenario is that users could be lulled into complacency due to their ignorance as to what everyone else on the network is doing. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for me as a Lightning user to know how many other people are potentially vulnerable to the failure of a whole bunch of Lightning channels all at once,\u201d Todd explained. \u201cI don\u2019t know that information; I can\u2019t necessarily react to that.\u201d\nOne possible catalyst for the Lightning Network\u2019s failure mode, which has also been articulated by BitGo Engineer, Jameson Lopp, could be too much centralization in the network topology. If a number of big players on the network all fail at once, all of the counterparties connected to those nodes will need to settle their smart contracts on-chain in a timely manner.\n\u201cIn the Lightning world, your Mt. Gox may not be able to steal your money, but it may cause you to have to do a transaction within a few days, and there might be a million other people like that,\u201d Todd explained.", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 5}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin, right now, is\u00a0not really anonymous. While Bitcoin addresses aren't necessarily linked to real-world identities, they can be. Monitoring the unencrypted peer-to-peer network, analysis of the public blockchain and know your customer (KYC) policy or anti-money laundering (AML) regulation can reveal a lot about who's using bitcoin and for what.\nThis is not great from a privacy perspective. Bitcoin users might not necessarily want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own, while businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors, to name some examples.\nAdditionally, bitcoins being traceable, possibly \u201ctainted,\u201d and potentially worth less than other bitcoins is at odds with\u00a0fungibility. This could even challenge bitcoin's value proposition as money.\nBut there are potential solutions to increase privacy and improve fungibility.\nOne solution to address this issue \u2013\u00a0Stealth Transactions \u2013 was introduced in 2014; and a new twist on this concept \u2013\u00a0Reusable Payment Codes \u2013 was proposed last year.\nThe Problem\nIn part to increase privacy (there are security benefits as well), it is recommended that Bitcoin users generate a brand new address for each transaction they receive. While this is not an airtight solution in itself, this can make it significantly harder to connect addresses to real world identities \u2012 both on the sending and the receiving end of the transaction.\nHowever, this also means that the receiver must share a new Bitcoin address with the sender each time a transaction is to be made. This can be a bit of a hassle and in some cases even impossible (think of donation addresses posted on websites). And it\u2019s not ideal from a privacy perspective either: If the new addresses are shared over an insecure channel, privacy is potentially lost entirely.\nStealth Transactions, first proposed in 2014 by\u00a0Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd, are designed to solve these problems. They use several cryptographic tricks, mostly based on\u00a0Diffie-Hellman key exchange, to let users accept payments on addresses they never generated, nor have even seen before.\nUnder the Hood\nThis is how Stealth Transactions work \u201cunder the hood.\u201d\n[Authors note: Since completion of this article, it was brought to my attention that there are actually several slightly different ways to construct Stealth Transactions. The strategy described here is only one particular option.]\nStealth Transactions require the sender and receiver of a transaction to have a (basically non-Bitcoin-related) cryptographic public and private key pair, each. We'll call these the \u201cstealth private keys\u201d and the \u201cstealth public keys.\u201d These \u201cstealth keys\u201d are used in several ways.\nThe first way is a fairly basic use-case of cryptography, which is, for example, used to encrypt emails. In short (and a bit simplified), the sender can take the receiver's stealth public key and use it to encrypt a message. The receiver \u2013 and only the receiver \u2013 will be able to decrypt this message with his stealth private key.\n(This works the other way around as well, of course: The receiver could encrypt a message for the sender \u2013 but that's not really relevant for Stealth Transactions.)\nThe second trick is slightly more complex. But, again, in simplified form, both stealth private keys can be combined through a mathematical formula, to create a Bitcoin private key. This Bitcoin private key can, in turn, be used to generate a corresponding Bitcoin address. So, using each other\u2019s stealth private key in combination with their own, both sender and receiver can generate this Bitcoin private key and Bitcoin address.\nAnd there is a third trick, in simplified form: This Bitcoin address (but not the corresponding Bitcoin private key) can also be derived from one of the stealth private keys and one of the stealth public keys. As such, either the sender or the receiver can generate the Bitcoin address by combining their own stealth private key with the other's stealth public key.\nIn Practice\nTo make a Stealth Transaction, these three tricks are cleverly combined:\nPossibly even before any payment was going to be made, the receiver generates a stealth key pair. It's this stealth public key that he,for example, posts on his website as a donation address. (As such, it\u2019s also called the \u201cStealth Address.\u201d) He doesn't share his stealth private key with anyone at all.\nWhen the sender wants to pay the receiver, he generates a \u201cthrowaway\u201d stealth private key for himself; specifically for that one transaction. (It\u2019s actually a \u201cnonce\u201d; just a random string of numbers \u2013 but has the same effect.) He then takes the receiver's stealth public key (or Stealth Address) and combines this with his own throwaway stealth private key, to generate a Bitcoin address and sends bitcoins to this Bitcoin address. (Well, almost... but let's assume that for a moment.)\nAt this point, no one can spend the bitcoins on this address because no one knows (nor is able to generate) the corresponding Bitcoin private key.\nBut here's the heart of the trick: the sender can allow the receiver to spend the bitcoins by sharing his throwaway stealth private key with him. With that throwaway stealth private key, the receiver would have both stealth private keys required to generate the Bitcoin private key.\nInterestingly, this is accomplished all at once, within the transaction that funds the Bitcoin address. Specifically, the sender includes a so-called OP_RETURN \u201cmessage\u201d in that transaction. This message consists of his throwaway private key, but encrypted using the receiver's public key, so no one but the receiver can decrypt it.\nTo receive this transaction, the receiver monitors the blockchain for OP_RETURN transactions and tries to decrypt all of them. Once he finds a decryptable OP-RETURN message, he also finds the throwaway stealth private key to combine with his own stealth private key, with which he can generate the Bitcoin private key to spend the bitcoins in that transaction.\nThe receiver will have received a secure payment on an address he didn't even own until the actual payment was made. Meanwhile, the outside world might not even know it was a Stealth Transaction; all they see is a normal Bitcoin-transaction with an undecipherable OP_RETURN message attached.\nReusable Payment Codes\nWhile Stealth Transactions offer a novel solution, the requirement to monitor the blockchain for OP_RETURN transactions do limit their potential. Specifically, light wallets typically don't store the entire blockchain and are, therefore, unable to receive Stealth Transactions. (DarkWallet, the only wallet that allows for Stealth Transactions so far, \u201coutsources\u201d this task to a server, which is not ideal for privacy.)\nReusable Payment Codes, introduced by Bitcoin developer Justus Ranvier in late 2015, are designed to solve this problem. They use another Bitcoin innovation designed by Bitcoin Core developer Dr. Pieter Wuille: The\u00a0Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) key creation and transfer protocol. In short, this protocol allows for the creation of a series of seemingly independent Bitcoin private keys and addresses from a single seed.\nWith Reusable Payment Codes, the sender sends a so-called \u201cextended public key\u201d to the receiver through an otherwise normal transaction. With this extended public key and the (\u201cstealth\u201d) public key as published by the receiver, the sender is able to generate a series of Bitcoin addresses to send bitcoins to. The receiver, meanwhile, can use this extended public key to combine it with his own (\u201cstealth\u201d) private key to generate the corresponding Bitcoin private keys.\nAs such, the sender can send an almost unlimited amount of transactions to the receiver, to addresses that can only be \u201clinked together\u201d by the sender and the receiver. Onlookers will see normal Bitcoin transactions \u2012 not knowing they all go to the same receiver; all while the receiver hasn\u2019t published any of them anywhere.\nHowever, since light wallets don\u2019t monitor the blockchain, the initial \u201cnotification\u201d transaction to serve as a \u201cpiggy back\u201d for the seed-data is recognizable, as such, to the outside world. This might reveal who is transacting if the addresses can be linked to real-world identities. Even then, it would reveal only who is transacting; not how much or on which subsequent addresses.\nThanks to Martijn Meijering, Justus Ranvier, and\u00a0Blockstream\u00a0president Adam Back for info and feedback.", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 5}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nOn Wednesday, the Bitcoin community went into a tizzy over BIP 75 (BIP stands for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal)\u00a0which is, in short, a layer-2 protocol for improving the user friendliness of Bitcoin payments.\nThe community, especially on Reddit, is concerned that the option to identify oneself to the sender or receiver of a payment may lead down the road toward know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) restrictions on the Bitcoin protocol. The hysteria around this proposal appears to have emerged from a post made by Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd to the Bitcoin development mailing list.\nPeter Todd recommends boycotting BIP75 due to AML/KYC concerns.\nWhat Is BIP 75?\nBefore getting into the controversy, it\u2019s important to understand the details of BIP 75. Bitcoin Magazine reported on the proposal\u2019s ability to simplify wallets for the average Joe earlier this year, but here are the key points:\n\nBIP 75 attempts to solve some of the privacy and security concerns with the Payment Protocol, which was outlined by former Bitcoin Core lead maintainer,\u00a0Gavin Andresen and former Bitcoin developer,\u00a0Mike Hearn in BIP 70.\nUnlike BIP 70, BIP 75 features end-to-end encryption.\nHuman-readable names can be used to make the payment process more user-friendly and create a Venmo-esque experience in Bitcoin wallets.\n\nThe co-authors of BIP 75 are from Netki (Justin Newton and Matt David) and Breadwallet (Aaron Voisine and James MacWhyte).\nWhat Are the Concerns With BIP 75?\nThere are currently two separate concerns with BIP 75 being discussed in the Bitcoin community. For one, some people believe that this BIP could make it easier to trace Bitcoin payments to real-world identities or simply streamline KYC and AML compliance for Bitcoin. The other issue is whether this BIP should be included in the main BIPs section of the Bitcoin Core GitHub repository.\n\u201cI'd strongly argue that we remove BIP 75 from the BIPs repository\u00a0and boycott wallets that implement it,\u201d Peter Todd recently stated on the Bitcoin development mailing list. \u201cIt's bad strategy for Bitcoin developers to willingly participate in AML [and] KYC [compliance], just the same way as it's bad for Tor to add wiretapping functionality\u00a0and W3C to support DRM tech. The minor tactical wins you'll get [out] of this aren't worth it.\u201d\nA Reddit thread linking to that post on the Bitcoin development mailing list was quickly filled with calls for a boycott on Breadwallet.\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Todd to gain a clearer picture of his thoughts on the matter. In terms of whether the BIP should be removed from the Bitcoin Core GitHub repository, Todd said, \u201cI think we should remove it because, like it or not, we are\u00a0putting a stamp of approval on it, to a degree.\u201d\nSome others, such as Bitcoin Core contributor Pieter Wuille, believe a removal would amount to censorship; however, Todd also pointed out that, in the past, a proper BIP for a colored coins standard has also been denied access to the GitHub repo.\nWhen it comes to the issues he sees with BIP 75 more generally, Todd said, \u201cBIP 75 institutionalizes [regulatory compliance] in a convenient way that everyone can easily use and expect. We should comply with AML [and] KYC [regulations] only grudgingly.\n\u201cIn much the same way that we have the threat of Tor nodes keeping logs; we don't help that process by creating a standard for those logs,\u201d Todd added.\nTo Todd\u2019s point, BIP 75 does make it easier for companies (financial in nature or not) to collect data on their customers. While the threat of a government forcing normal retailers to collect identifying information about customers who use Bitcoin always existed, BIP 75 has the potential to streamline this process.\nDuring his conversation with Bitcoin Magazine, Todd made it clear that he\u2019s more concerned with senders of bitcoins identifying themselves than the recipients of those funds. \u201cThe part of BIP 75 that's about determining who you're sending money to isn't objectionable, just the idea of trying to figure out who is actually sending the funds,\u201d he stated.\nThose who disagree with Todd would point out that BIP 75 is a completely opt-in protocol. To this point, Todd responded, \u201cBlacklists can also be implemented in an \u2018opt-in\u2019 way; that doesn't mean we should support the concept.\u201d\nBIP 75 Author Responds\nBitcoin Magazine also reached out to one of the authors of BIP 75, Netki CEO Justin Newton. One of the first things Newton was able to clarify was that the personally-identifying information sent in the payment protocol can be seen only by the sender and receiver involved in a particular transaction.\n\u201cWe actually added another layer of encryption (at the application layer) as a way to protect against the data being man-in-the-middled,\u201d said Newton.\nAccording to Newton, a BIP 75 user does not even have to trust his or her own phone or laptop to keep payment info private when a hardware wallet is used.\nNewton also shares similar concerns to Todd and others in terms of a potential slippery slope toward AML and KYC compliance on the vast majority (if not all) of Bitcoin transactions.\n\u201cI actually share their concern, but it led me to a different conclusion,\u201d said Newton. \u201cMy view was that AML and KYC compliance is going to be required if we want to get to the mass market\u00a0and we need to ensure it is done in a way that fundamentally protects fungibility, privacy and the open, permissionless nature of Bitcoin. In the absence of a standard that encourages those values, we will end up with hidden systems that do exactly the same thing, but without taking the concerns of the community into account.\u201d\nJudging from a Reddit comment by Breadwallet CEO, the wallet maker is not interested in BIP 75 for regulatory compliance reasons. Instead, Breadwallet is mostly interested in the proposal for reasons related to the user-friendliness (or lack thereof) of Bitcoin wallets. BIP 75 enables useful features that are found in more mainstream payment applications (think Venmo) such as human-readable transaction logs and address books. It\u2019s also possible for users to manually track their transaction history on their own, but BIP 75 greatly simplifies the process.\nSo, Is BIP 75 a Worrisome Proposal?\nThe BIP 75 debate ties in with many of the other Bitcoin debates that have taken place over the years. Does the community want privacy and security or easy-to-use wallets? Is it worth abandoning some of the early principles of the network in order to seek mass adoption?\nIn this case, it appears that not much of a trade-off is being made by individuals who wish to use BIP 75-enabled wallets. All of their personal information is end-to-end encrypted\u00a0and they aren\u2019t likely giving up much (if any) information that wouldn\u2019t already be known by the recipient of a transaction. Also, it\u2019s important to remember that this is a layer-2, opt-in protocol.\nHaving said that, it\u2019s always important for the Bitcoin community to remain vigilant against attempts to apply traditional financial regulations to the Bitcoin blockchain. After all, Bitcoin\u2019s core value proposition is the ability to transfer value across the internet in a censorship-resistant manner. The people who need Bitcoin as a payment system are those who would normally be blocked from other, traditional systems such as PayPal or credit cards.\nIt appears that BIP 75 is not a huge move in the wrong direction, but all Bitcoin users should refrain from attaching identifying information to their transactions as often as possible. In addition to that, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to focus on the real problem, which is the need for enhanced privacy features.\nResponding to the concerns,\u00a0Breadwallet Director of Product Management James MacWhyte told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n\"BIP75 puts users in total control of how much information they share and who they share it with. Some people may not realize that you will always be able to choose to share no information and remain anonymous. It is a huge improvement in privacy, and an essential building block in making Bitcoin more accessible and powerful.\n\n\n\"Avoiding address reuse is important for maintaining privacy and security, yet having to manually send a new address every time you want to receive money is cumbersome and inconvenient. We wanted to automate that process, but if your wallet gave out an address to anyone who asked your privacy would not be protected. That\u2019s why we designed BIP75, which will allow us to automatically give out payment addresses only to the people you trust. It is a huge improvement in privacy, and an essential building block in making Bitcoin more accessible and powerful.\n\n\n\"Breadwallet is working hard to make Bitcoin as easy as possible, without jeopardizing our top two priorities: security and privacy for all our users. We will never require personal information in order to use our wallet.\"\n\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 30}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nBitcoin Core contributor, Peter Todd, was recently interviewed on Bitcoin Uncensored by co-hosts Chris DeRose and Joshua Unseth. Ethereum, The DAO, private blockchains and many other topics were discussed but DeRose turned the conversation toward an often-discussed concept (at least on Bitcoin Uncensored) near the end of the show: The idea that governments essentially subsidize the usefulness of Bitcoin and the bitcoin price through their various regulations.\nBitcoin Fulfills a Need in the Market\nThere are many types of applications that people want to build with blockchain technology but only a minor fraction of these projects have found any use in the real world. While there are plenty of techno-geeks who think it\u2019s cool to play around with various cryptocurrencies and blockchain-related projects, Bitcoin seems to be the only blockchain system that has seen use outside of those who are tech-savvy.\n\u201cWe see that a lot of the people that are using Bitcoin (locally and looking at the exchanges) are using Bitcoin because they need to use it,\u201d DeRose said. \u201cThey have to use it because they can\u2019t use fiat.\n\u201cThis is what has differentiated Bitcoin from other blockchain projects, in that Bitcoin fulfills a need,\u201d DeRose added.\nSome areas where Bitcoin is truly needed include online gambling and darknet marketplaces. These sorts of use cases also fuel the view of Bitcoin as a digital gold.\nFungibility a Huge Part of This Need\nWhen it comes to the situations where Bitcoin is needed, fungibility plays a huge role. DeRose referred to this use case as \u201cthe ability to convert value into anonymous value.\u201d\nWhen asked about the importance of fungibility in Bitcoin, Todd said, \u201cYeah, I think that\u2019s Bitcoin\u2019s main use case there. If you didn\u2019t have that as a need, you could just go use PayPal.\n\u201cThe most clever thing governments could do to kill Bitcoin is make anonymous, electronic cash,\u201d Todd added.\nOf course, it\u2019s also true that there\u2019s plenty of room for improvement in terms of Bitcoin\u2019s fungibility. New privacy improvements, such as Confidential Transactions, may eventually offer assistance here. JoinMarket, a market for CoinJoin transactions, is another project that is already helping users gain more effective privacy on the blockchain right now.\nGovernments Subsidize Bitcoin with Their Regulations\nSince Bitcoin is mostly needed in situations where fungibility is a must, it isn\u2019t much of a stretch to say that governments essentially subsidize the usefulness of Bitcoin because government-backed restrictions and censorship on financial transactions are a major factor in the need for a fungible bearer ecash.\nWhen asked if he thinks governments are issuing regulatory subsidies for the existence of the Bitcoin blockchain, Todd responded, \u201cI think that\u2019s pretty much exactly what\u2019s happened.\u201d\nTodd then went on to talk about the abandoned MintChip project in Canada, which was essentially an attempt to create an anonymous, electronic cash system. \u201cIt appears they axed [the project] because nobody wanted to go and create anonymous, electronic cash. They just didn\u2019t have the willpower to do it,\u201d explained Todd.\nDoes Bitcoin Have Government to Thank for Its Existence?\nThis gets to the question of when it makes sense to use a blockchain. Are they still useful in a world where governments allow anonymous ecash to exist at a large scale? \u201cIt may only make sense when the regulatory environment allows it to make sense,\u201d DeRose noted.\nTodd put this thought experiment another way: Would Tor be interesting or useful if governments didn\u2019t wiretap their citizens? The answer here is obviously yes because governments are not the only \u201cadversaries\u201d in the world. The Tor Project has a list of the types of people who use the anonymizing network on their website.\nWhile there may be some use cases of bitcoin that don\u2019t involve getting around government regulations, it\u2019s clear that these government-avoiding use cases are what propelled Bitcoin to what it is today. Bitcoin first rose in popularity due to Silk Road and the financial blockade on Wikileaks. Silk Road allowed Bitcoin users to buy and sell goods and services that had been criminalized by various governments around the world, while Wikileaks is a journalistic organization that runs on donations \u2012 strictly via bitcoin during the financial blockade.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Bitcoin would have taken the digital world by storm if these sorts of use cases didn\u2019t exist early on in the technology\u2019s development. The level of distrust in the world\u2019s financial system at the time (and to this day) also couldn\u2019t have hurt.", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 30}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe second so-called Bitcoin \u201cblock halving\u201d is fast approaching. This week, as three-quarters of all bitcoins have been mined, the block subsidy will decrease from 25 bitcoins per block to 12.5. A key event in Bitcoin's history, eagerly anticipated by some \u2013 and perhaps somewhat feared by others.\nMore than anyone else, Bitcoin miners stand to be affected by the event: producing blocks is their business and the block reward presents the major chunk of their revenue. Having spoken to\u00a0BTCC COO, Samson Mow, and\u00a0BitFury CEO, Valery Vavilov,\u00a0last week, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to other miners to see how they are preparing for the upcoming halving.\nWhat do\u00a0AntPool's Jihan Wu,\u00a0Genesis Mining's Marco Krohn,\u00a0HaoBTC's Eric Mu and\u00a0Slush Pool's Marek Palatinus expect of the halving?\nOptimism\nMuch like BTCC's Mow and BitFury's Vavilov, all miners Bitcoin Magazine spoke with are approaching the upcoming halving with a general sense of optimism. While a halving of the subsidy cuts directly into their revenue stream, miners recognize this is key to Bitcoin's value proposition.\nWu is the co-founder of Chinese ASIC manufacturer, Bitmain, which also runs AntPool, the second largest mining pool in the world, controlling some 20 percent of total hash power. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Wu said he expects the Bitcoin price to rise as a result of the halving.\n\u201cBitcoin's monetary policy is not perfect but it delivers on its promise. Delivering promise is very difficult for a monetary bureau or a central bank,\u201d Wu said. \u201cI believe the halving will have a very positive impact as the new supply will be much less than before. Logical analysis does not necessarily lead to a doubling-of-price conclusion but I do see the anticipation of the market having a positive impact on the price.\u201d\nMu, CMO at Chinese mining pool and wallet service HaoBTC, shared Wu's optimism. Mu, who's HaoBTC accounts for some 3 percent of total hash power, agreed that Bitcoin's limited supply is a major selling point for the cryptographic currency and believes the future for the mining landscape is generally bright.\nMu said:\n\n\u201cA major factor that got me attracted to Bitcoin is the inflexibility of its monetary supply. The finite supply and halving-every-four-years scheme led me to believe that it was less subject to human fiddling, at least not controlled by a small group of political elites to the same extent as most fiat currencies in today's world.\u201d\n\nHe added:\n\n\u201cI recently spent a couple weeks in western China, mostly Sichuan and Xinjiang. I sense there is strong optimism, both based on what my own company is planning and what I saw others are doing. I haven\u2019t heard anyone telling me that they are divesting because of the halving. Of course, I haven\u2019t \u2012 and couldn't have \u2012 talked with everyone in the industry, so can\u2019t eliminate the possibility that I missed the larger picture.\u201d\n\nKrohn, CFO and co-founder of major cloud mining service Genesis Mining, shared the general sense of optimism as well, although he was more skeptical of the assumption that the price will continue to rise as a result of the subsidy halving.\n\u201cThe normal argument goes like this: Given constant demand for Bitcoin and the fact that the supply for Bitcoin is halving, the price should go up,\u201d Krohn said. \u201cWhile the argument is correct at the first glance, it neglects that the event is known to every participant and thus will be 'priced in.' Speculators will start buying Bitcoin before the event takes place and thus will anticipate the outcome. Some of the price increase we have seen since the end of May, might be attributed to that.\u201d\nRisks\nAlthough general sentiment under the miners was positive, others have warned about risks relating to the halving.\u00a0Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong in\u00a0particular, but\u00a0also some\u00a0Bitcoin Core developers and other experts are concerned the subsidy halving might cause some miners to shut down their machines due to a lack of revenue.\u00a0\nThis could, in turn, lead to a drop in hash rate which means confirmation times would increase. Given current network capacity, moreover, this might lead to increased network congestion as more blocks fill up. In a worst-case scenario, a potential resulting decrease in user experience might even lead to users selling their bitcoins, therefore pressing the price and miner revenue even further down \u2012 which could lead to more miners shutting down their machines: a \u201cdeath spiral.\u201d\nThe miners Bitcoin Magazine spoke with did not consider this scenario very likely, however, and said they are not too concerned about it.\nGenesis Mining's Krohn explained:\n\n\u201cWe believe any drop in hash rate will be relatively small, like 10 to 25 percent. This is because electricity contracts are generally fixed for a longer period; if a contract doesn't run out before the end of the month, you won't stop mining before the end of the month. Likewise, the economics of mining mean that significant amounts of money is invested in hardware. Since people have been aware of the halving event, it would not make sense for them to invest in hardware in the last \u2013 say \u2013 6 months if they're going to turn their equipment off. Yet, most of the hardware was indeed added in the\u00a0last seven to eight months. Add to that, that most of the investments in the last year were done with a much lower Bitcoin price in mind. Even now, new hardware is available from manufacturers and the roll-out is in full swing. Comparable events, like the Litecoin halving of August 2015, showed little impact on the overall hash rate, too.\u201d\n\nKrohn specifically addresses the potential \u201cdeath spiral\u201d series of events:\n\n\u201cThe general 'death spiral' argument is correct. Blocks may fill up due to a drop in hash rate. But since our expectation is that this drop will not be too big, we believe that any congestion will be limited. It certainly will cause some annoyance, but on the other hand, most market participants are aware of it and will not dump their bitcoin for that reason. Also, a difficulty adjustment will take place two or three weeks later, after which things will be back to normal.\u201d\n\nPalatinus, operator of Slush Pool (representing some 5 percent of total hash power) was not concerned either. Agreeing with other miners, he referred to the significant increase of Bitcoin's exchange rate over the past year as an indication that miners will be fine.\n\n\u201cI generally agree that the halving will not be a problem. I do believe any potential price increase because of it is already reflected in the current exchange rate. But if mining was profitable enough for miners on price levels slightly above $200 USD, which we saw less than a year ago, it will be profitable with the current price \u2012 even after the halving.\u201d\n\nHaoBTC's Mu agreed there is nothing to worry about. If anything, he believes total hash rate will continue to rise as it has done significantly over the past months.\nMu:\n\n\u201cDuring my trip in Western China, I saw a several new mines under construction. Also recently, I got contacted by a few professional miners outside China to help locate cheap power in China. So, based on my personal experience, I doubt that the hash rate will drop at all, if not grow substantially with major manufacturers poised to release new miners powered by more effective chips.\u201d\n", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 6}
{"title": "Ethereum\u2019s DAO Forking Crisis: The Bitcoin Perspective", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/ethereum-s-dao-forking-crisis-the-bitcoin-perspective-1467404395/", "birthday": "Jul 1, 2016  4:19 PM EST", "date": "2016-07-01 21:19:00", "content": "Aaron van Wirdum is interested in decentralized consensus, FOSS, privacy in the digital age, censorship resistant payments, and more of that stereotypical Bitcoin stuff. Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nEthereum is in a state of crisis. \u201cThe DAO\u201d (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), a code-based and leaderless investment vehicle that crowd-funded a record-breaking 150 million USD worth of ether, was unexpectedly drowned by an unknown hacker two weeks ago. About a third of all invested ether \u2013 some 4 percent of the total ether supply \u2013 is now sitting in a so-called \u201cChild DAO\u201d, waiting until it can be withdrawn in another two weeks from now.\nThis presents the Ethereum community with a tough choice and three* main options. First, the community can decide to \u201cdo nothing\u201d and allow the hacker to withdraw his funds. Second, the community can deploy a soft fork to freeze any funds associated with The DAO, ensuring the attacker cannot withdraw any of it*. And third, the community can deploy a hard fork to essentially \u201croll back\u201d the entire existence of The DAO on a protocol-level, take back the lost funds and give it all back to the original investors.\nThe DAO in no way affects Bitcoin, and the choice is fundamentally to be made by the Ethereum community. But the hack and chosen solution may draw a stark and telling contrast with Bitcoin, and the Bitcoin community. Bitcoin Magazine therefore reached out to prominent bitcoiners and asked:\n\u201cWhat should the Ethereum community do, and is this any different from what the Bitcoin community should do were a similar situation to arise?\u201d\n*A newly discovered vulnerability suggests that soft forking may not be an option after all, and the only choice left is that between doing nothing and hard forking. At the time of writing of this article, not all respondends where aware of this development.\nStephen Pair,\u00a0BitPay\u00a0co-founder and CEO\n\u201cThe Ethereum community should ask themselves whether the fundamental premise of an Ethereum blockchain is flawed. Bitcoin transactions have a very specific purpose, and a payment system requires broad participation. An Internet scale naming system is another kind of database that might require a similar approach to Bitcoin. Most contracts, on the other hand, involve a limited set of parties that care about its state and execution. It's not clear to me that you need a broad participation blockchain on which to execute contracts.\nAs for a similar situation in Bitcoin... it's impossible for something like The DAO hack to occur in Bitcoin, because it would not be possible to write code for a DAO that is directly executed by Bitcoin miners.\nBugs in Bitcoin will occasionally cause a fork in the chain at which point miners need to reach a consensus on which path to follow. But what the Ethereum community is contemplating is a fork of the chain to bail out the users of a specific contract. The closest analogy would be the Bitcoin block chain forking because someone erroneously sent bitcoin or accidentally destroyed bitcoin. That has happened many times and no one has ever seriously suggested the Bitcoin chain should be forked as a result.\u201d\nAndreas Schildbach,\u00a0Bitcoin Wallet,\u00a0bitcoinj\u00a0and\u00a0Bloq developer\n\u201cI must admit I've not followed the events surrounding The DAO fully, as I'm more into Bitcoin. But I think matters are even more complicated than just a choice of whether or not to fork. As I understand it, a freeze of funds would also freeze the funds of similar DAOs. And I believe more exploitable flaws have been found by now, some of which could also be attributed to Ethereum's Virtual Machine itself, rather than just an application running as a smart contract... There probably is no easy way out.\nAs it stands, I think Ethereum should not attempt to fix or undo The DAO. No soft forks, no hard forks, and please no blacklists. Blacklists in particular would drive credibility to zero for me.\u201d\nMarek Palatinus,\u00a0SatoshiLabs architect and\u00a0Slush Pool operator\n\u201cAllowing The DAO to fund itself far beyond its $500,000 USD target was an expensive mistake. But the Ethereum community should do nothing, because it's not an Ethereum fault. Bugs in contracts will be quite common and we have to learn how to live with it, exactly as we live with Bitcoin thefts and hacks. If there's a space for code analysis tools preventing those contract bugs in the future, let them evolve.\nAs for Bitcoin, if there's ever a bug in the protocol or the reference implementation, the community should focus on resolving the bug as soon as possible,\u00a0as happened with the LevelDB bug in 2013. I can even imagine blockchain rollback in a case of major security issue. But blacklisting coins or doing rollbacks because of faults not directly related to Bitcoin is unacceptable for me.\u201d\nElizabeth Stark,\u00a0Lightning co-founder\n\u201cThe Ethereum community should be more cognizant of the long term dangers of censorship and intervention at the protocol level. The meta description for their site says: 'Ethereum is a decentralized platform for applications that run exactly as programmed without any chance of fraud, censorship or third-party interference.' The hard fork proposal, while well-intentioned, would interfere with the protocol to retrieve the DAO funds. This opens up a Pandora's box of other questions about why funds should be recovered in certain cases and not others, and what would happen when governments come knocking. If they go through with it, they should make it very clear that this is a one-time only fix.\nA similar situation is less likely for the Bitcoin community, because we structured our protocol differently. At the core of the values of Bitcoin is to keep complex functionality out of the low level protocol, as complexity is the enemy of security.\nThat said, if there were an issue with an application on a Layer 2 protocol, there's no chance the Bitcoin community would support a fork that would take currency out of circulation, or modify ownership of the currency. Even considering such a move would be preposterous to many, as it's in such opposition to the community values. It would defeat the purpose of having a censorship resistant protocol and ensuring the fungibility of all coins; it would go against everything we've worked for the last 7 years to achieve.\u201d\nManfred Karrer,\u00a0Bitsquare developer\n\u201cFirst of all, the Ethereum community should be prepared for more trouble, and not under-estimate the 'attacker.'\u00a0He seems to be very smart, and I suspect he will not give up but fight back much harder if the funds get frozen or confiscated. The failure of The DAO also questions Initial Coin Offerings. Why collect $150 million USD worth if there was no need for so much money? I also think The DAO represents an unhealthy combination of conflicts of interests for the developers, combined with a pretentious marketing campaign that suggested investors could only win.\nOn top of that, the Ethereum community should slow down. One argument in favor of a fork, is that a high percentage of the overall ether-supply could be in the hands of a single person, and that this would be a risk when Proof of Stake is to be introduced. But if that is indeed such a risk, it means the proposed Proof of Stake system \u2013 'Casper' - is completely insecure. It needs to be delayed until it can deal with a hostile whales owning large swaths of ether.\nFinally, regarding forks, they should do nothing. Censorship resistance is the only valid excuse for using the slow and expensive blockchain.\u201d\nPaul Sztorc,\u00a0Hivemind and\u00a0Bloq developer\n\u201cAs an Ethereum-skeptic, I'm happy to report that all options available to the Ethereum community are disastrous.\nThe 'soft fork idea' probably wouldn't work at all: the attacker can broadcast withdrawal transactions which have multi-million dollar fees. This 'smart contract bribe' defeats the soft fork.\nSimilarly, the hard fork is more impractical than it may first appear. Vitalik, and the other developers, are largely powerless. Anyone can copy their GitHub commits, and so 'old-ETH' can keep up with 'new-ETH' for free. Investors have no reason to choose New over Old, because they get both for free. Meanwhile, the attacker can bribe miners, on both chains, as seen above. And at least one exchange might keep Old, or trade in both. The hard fork might create two ether sets, and the resulting chaos would likely cause Old-Eth to win... defeating the hard fork.\nWere the hard fork to succeed, it would demonstrate centralization. The mixture of 'centralization' and 'anonymous e-cash' is not pretty. Key individuals may be arrested, kidnapped, or worse... and the responsible agent ('insiders') could short the market, and make off with tens of millions \u2013 tax free.\nYet, worst of all for Ethereum would be to do nothing. The DAO is, in a sense, Ethereum's debut. It was the first significant thing that Ethereum could do, that Bitcoin couldn't. It was hyped by credible people and trusted media outlets. One feature was praised above all: the ability to withdraw from the project at any time using a Child DAO (oh, the irony).\nThe DAO failure reveals all of these people for what they are: unqualified. And if the Ethereum team is unqualified, what does that leave, exactly? Ethereum is currently in second place \u2013 a losing position - in a winner-take-all environment. Unlike Bitcoin, it has no daily 'users'... without faith, Ethereum can't survive. And why keep the faith, if the Ethereum team can't 'solve' this problem?\"\nTuur Demeester,\u00a0Adamant Research editor in chief\n\u201cMt. Gox was a system built on top of Bitcoin. Because of its poor design, 7 percent of the supply at the time was stolen \u2013 versus 4 percent of Ethereum's supply now. A hard or soft fork to return the bitcoins was never suggested. Bitcoin, as per Satoshi's writings, is conceived of as digital cash, a 'digital metal' that is as inert as gold. Users of bitcoin and gold alike are expected to understand this circumstance, and therefore understand that this great responsibility is what at the same time gives them great freedom to be in charge of their own financial futures.\nSimilarly, Ethereum was conceived of and promoted as \u2018a system that cannot care.\u2019\u00a0Ethereum indeed doesn't care about The DAO. It just does what it does. It seems only fair and logical that Ethereum users shouldn't be forced to care about it. In other words: no freezing or reversing of funds, and no hard or soft fork for that purpose.\u201d\nEric Voskuil,\u00a0Libbitcoin lead developer\n\u201cThe people directly validating \u2013 receiving payments on an Ethereum full node - are the 'community.' This community 'should' do whatever the members prefer, realizing that lack of consensus can lead to their own loss. Distributed decision making is the definition of what 'should' be done, and there can be no alternative. If everyone in a community agrees there is no problem with a change, that is the essence of consensus.\nThe more interesting question is: 'How large is the actual community?' If most people defer validation to centralized systems, there is very little security against changes to the money, since these people are not part of the actual community. This will make a money unpredictable and cause people to avoid it.\nBitcoin can't be any different. Though the community is presumably larger and therefore more resistant to change.\u201d\nThomas Voegtlin,\u00a0Electrum lead developer\n\u201cI don't see how something like this could happen with Bitcoin. From an investor's perspective, the closest we had was Mt. Gox. However, the Mt. Gox failure was not caused by a technical issue with Bitcoin itself. In contrast, The DAO situation does not seem to result solely from poor programming; the programming language used to write contracts in Ethereum should have better semantics, and be amenable to formal verification.\nAs it turns out, a soft fork freezing The DAO funds is no longer really an option, so the only serious way to revert the DAO hack is through a hard fork. With only 15 days remaining until the DAO funds can be spent, I doubt that consensus over such a hard fork can be achieved. It takes time to write code, have it properly audited, deploy it, and let miners signal their willingness to fork. It might therefore be safer for Ethereum to not bail out the DAO.\u201d\nDavid Bailey,\u00a0BTC Media\u00a0CEO\n\u201cEthereum should probably do nothing, though I think a soft fork would be acceptable. A hard fork - even more so than a soft fork - turns a The DAO-only problem into an existential crisis.\nThis situation also exposes the potential risks of having core developers with conflicts of interest... I would be very curious to know The DAO losses of the 30 to 50 individuals that make up Ethereum's inner circle.\nAs for Bitcoin, I don't think it would be possible to get a contentious hard fork passed considering the amount of debate we've had over a potential 2 megabyte block size limit increase. The DAO hack also validates Bitcoin's more conservative approach to development.\nI think the debate is healthy as long as the Ethereum community comes out strongly against a hard fork. This would be a sign of Ethereum-maturity.\u201d\nSamson Mow,\u00a0BTCC\u00a0COO\n\u201cIn terms of utility, cryptocurrencies and game currencies \u2013 like\u00a0Diablo gold \u2013 aren't so different from each other. The key difference is that game currencies are managed by for-profit organizations that can tweak the economy, patch design flaws, and roll back when they deem necessary to protect their vested interests. Ethereum must decide what it wants to be: a cryptocurrency or a game currency.\nThe Ethereum community may be in a difficult position now, but I think they only have one real choice available and that is to do nothing. This is assuming that they want to be taken seriously as a viable cryptocurrency. Choosing either a hard fork or soft fork to interfere would demonstrate that Ethereum\u2019s blockchain is very mutable and that short term interests take priority over everything else.\nI really couldn't see a similar situation arising in Bitcoin simply because Bitcoin Core developers are very cautious in rolling out new functionality and test extensively. Moreover, Bitcoin Core\u2019s ethos runs counter to the market intervention that is currently being encouraged by Ethereum developers.\nSimply put: it\u2019s hard to imagine the Core team pushing out code intended to recover their personal losses, lost in a highly experimental project they invested in, which was poorly design and untested, that also clearly was a massive conflict of interest.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 1}

After the Second World War, the factory produced watches under the brand name Pobeda until 1961, when production of the Raketa [Rocket] watches started, named in honor of the first flight into space by Yuri Gagarin.\nIn a bid to restructure the historical watch brand, the company entered a rebranding stage in 2009 under the direction of Russian, Swiss and French experts, with director Jacques von Polier heading the creative and design department.\nWith an international team of Blockchain Engine developers working together with the Raketa, it wasn\u2019t long before they were embarking on a large-scale production to implement blockchain technology in the construction of the luxury line of watches in an area that is often imitated in Russia.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Blockchain Engine spokesman Ivan Kuznetsov said that his team understands the enormous potential of blockchain technology and started looking at how it would bring real benefits to companies in the spring of 2016.\n\u201cAmong the applicants were car manufacturers, jewelry manufacturers, unique luxury objects, and smartphones,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have carefully examined the information about products most often counterfeited, and it turned out there is a whole market of watch imitation, with the most falsified brand in Russia [being] the Rocket.\u201d\nThe use of blockchain will allow confirmation of the authenticity of each watch, which will drastically reduce the possibility of forgery. As each luxury watch will have a serial number associated with it at the production stage, they make the perfect items for a digital registry.\nInputting the relevant information on the blockchain removes the need for paper certificates. Unsurprisingly, this method of recording information has long been fraught with problems, as they can easily be forged or lost.\nKuznetsov said that after coming into contact with von Polier, the team at Blockchain Engine found that he was a very progressive man continually thinking about how to make the products for his customers better, in addition to how to get new markets and to make the factory prosperous.\n\u201cWe met with Jacques [and when we] told what we were doing, he took the idea of the fight against counterfeiting through the use of blockchain services with great enthusiasm,\u201d said Kuznetsov. \u201c[He] immediately invited us to visit the factory where an interesting excursion for us was organized, after which we realized how to implement our technology into business processes.\u201d\nDigital Proof of Ownership\nAs the luxury watch industry is already well-established, there will be many companies turning their attention to the use of the blockchain technology in a bid to replace the archaic paper certificates as a way of authenticating watches.\nKuznetsov told Bitcoin Magazine that with the creation of unique keys for each product they are guaranteed to belong to the manufacturer and, afterward, to the buyer, with counterfeit serial numbers becoming immediately visible.\n\u201cWe keep counterfeit goods manufacturers well under control between law and mathematics,\u201d he said. \u201cVehicles or works of art theft for the purpose of resale will have become meaningless [as] counterfeits will be very easy to distinguish from the original, even without involving the experts.\u201d\nPhoto\u00a0Sosoev\u00a0/ Creative Commons", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 7}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nLate last week, a post on Chinese Bitcoin community website 8btc gained a lot of attention in certain English-language Bitcoin circles, particularly the subreddit /r/btc. The post stated that Chinese Bitcoin miners should band together and push for a hard-forking change to the Bitcoin protocol via a switch in software from Bitcoin Core to Bitcoin Classic.\nThere has been some confusion in the days after the original \u201cTerminator Plan\u201d was posted on 8btc, as some in the Bitcoin community appear to believe this is a genuine plan agreed upon by Bitcoin miners in China. Bitcoin Magazine has reached out to two Bitcoin mining pools in China, and both have distanced themselves from the plan.\nThe Numbers Don\u2019t Add Up\nWhen looking over the Terminator Plan, one of the obvious issues with the letter is that the numbers simply don\u2019t add up. The plan would supposedly involve greater than 75 percent of the hashrate coming together to support Bitcoin Classic, but roughly 20 percent of the network (represented by BTCC and BitFury) have made their support for Bitcoin Core rather clear over the past few months. This means that nearly every other Bitcoin mining pool or miner \u2012 even those outside of China \u2012 would have to be involved in the Terminator Plan for it to be real.\n\u201cOf course the math doesn\u2019t add up because the plan isn\u2019t real,\u201d said BTCC COO Samson Mow. \u201cTowards the bottom of the 8btc post it does say, \u2018This is a suggestion to mining pools.\u2019 Just because something is posted in Chinese on a Chinese forum it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true or that you\u2019re going to get an accurate understanding via Google Translate,\u201d he continued.\nAt least one media outlet even questioned whether BTCC\u2019s level of support for Bitcoin Core may be on the decline but Mow was quick to dismiss this theory via Twitter:\n\nIt's very creative FUD. https://t.co/8C9gy6MqEo\u2014 Samson Mow (@Excellion) July 1, 2016\n\n\u201cAs long as BTCC is operating Bitcoin exchanges and a Bitcoin mining pool, it\u2019s not possible that we\u2019d support a plan to compromise Bitcoin\u2019s security or to hijack the development of the protocol,\u201d Mow explained. \u201cPlus, the basis of the Terminator Plan is to replace Core with Classic. That\u2019s just plain ridiculous.\u201d\nHaoBTC Still Supports Bitcoin Core, but Not Unconditionally\nIn addition to Mow, Bitcoin Magazine also reached out to Eric Mu, who runs marketing and strategy for HaoBTC. Mu was perplexed by the reaction to the 8btc post from the English-speaking Bitcoin community, partially due to the fact that the author of the post was anonymous.\n\u201cAs far as I know, the company never discussed the Terminator Plan, publicly or privately,\u201d Mu said when asked if HaoBTC has discussed this plan in the past. \u201cWhen I first read the article, my impression was that author was a bit tongue-in-cheek, but the views he expressed echoed a sentiment that has been around for some time.\u201d\nMu then clarified HaoBTC\u2019s stance on the block size debate:\n\n\u201cHaoBTC's official stance has been consistent and was clearly expressed in the Hong Kong Consensus. Our support of Core over its alternatives is based on our commitment to the [Hong Kong] Consensus and dedication to building a governance model based on open dialogue between the industry and the development community, thus it is not unconditional.\u201d\n\nAlthough parts of the Bitcoin community would like to see the mining community have a bigger role in protocol development decisions, Mu revealed some of the reasons miners are hesitant to take a stand. \u201cSome are wary of the current Core developers all quitting in the Mike Hearn fashion, which might lead to a disastrous outcome; some simply don't want the rest of the world to perceive Bitcoin as being controlled by the Chinese, a narrative that has gained currency in the media as demonstrated by the recent New York Times article,\u201d explained Mu.\nAntpool Doesn\u2019t Dismiss the Rumors\nOne of the oddest aspects of this story is that Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu has been unwilling to dismiss the rumors surrounding the Terminator Plan. When asked about the issue on Twitter, Wu repeatedly responded by saying there is no censorship on Chinese forums and ideas are allowed to be discussed freely \u2012 an obvious slight at the /r/Bitcoin subreddit where moderation is sometimes perceived to be heavy.\nHaoBTC has also sent out their own tweet regarding the Terminator Plan without offering any clarification (at the time of publication of this article):\n\n\"miners on the move following comments by at least 3 Core devs that the hardfork has no chance of being merged\" https://t.co/SZjzoEDoZy\u2014 HaoBTC (@HaoBTC) July 3, 2016\n\nIn terms of how Jihan Wu and HaoBTC are handling the situation, Mow responded, \u201cThey\u2019re being coy about it. However, you really can\u2019t expect us to dismiss every single rumor that r/btc speculates themselves into a frenzy over. Then we\u2019d never get any work done.\u201d\nThe moderators of the /r/Bitcoin subreddit received some flack on social media for initially removing the 8btc post and claiming it was FUD due to editorialized titles, but it appears that they got things right on this occasion.", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 7}

The DAO \u2012 an acronym for Distributed Autonomous Organization \u2012 is similar to an open venture capital fund based on Ethereum smart contracts and rapidly became the world\u2019s largest crowdfunding to date.\nShortly after its launch, The DAO had an equally spectacular crash caused by poorly understood aspects of its implementation of smart contracts, which a malicious attacker was able to exploit.\nEmin Gun Sirer of Cornell University told The Economist, \u201cthe attacker simply read the terms and conditions more closely than anyone else.\u201d\nRegardless of misfortunes and temporary setbacks that are only to be expected in the early phases of a new technology with a potentially disruptive impact, DAOs have a huge potential. According to futurist David Orban, The DAO can be a pathfinder and a model for very ambitious crowdfunded initiatives to tackle important challenges, including a new global phase of the space program.\n\u201cFrom the $10 million order of magnitude crowdsales two years ago, to the $100 million crowdsale today, we will get to $1 billion in a couple of years, and then to $10 billion in another two-three,\u201d he said.\nNow, other renowned cryptographers, technologists and economists specialized in future studies are starting to weigh in. Futurist Ralph Merkle, who is also one of the inventors of public key cryptography, the inventor of cryptographic hashing and the originator of the \u201cMerkle Trees\u201d used in blockchain systems including Bitcoin and Ethereum, has published a paper titled \u201cDAOs, Democracy and Governance.\u201d Merkle\u2019s thesis is that DAOs and crowdsourcing could lead to a new form of democracy which is more stable, less prone to erratic behavior, better able to meet the needs of its citizens and which better uses the expertise of all its citizens to make high-quality decisions.\n\u201cWe call this new form of democracy a DAO Democracy,\u201d says Merkle. \u201cFurther analysis and small-scale implementations combined with further research into their effectiveness, seem both warranted and urgently needed, given the range of problems facing humanity today and the more pressing problems anticipated in the future.\u201d\nFutarchy, proposed by futurist Robin Hanson, a professor of economy at George Mason University and the author of a much discussed recent book about radically futuristic economy, is a proposal to govern by prediction markets. \u201cThe proposal seems like an excellent approach for improving upon existing democratic forms of governance,\u201d says Merkle.\nPrediction markets are speculative markets created for the purpose of making predictions. The current market price for a prediction \u2012 for example the election of a particular candidate \u2012 can be interpreted as an aggregate, crowdsourced estimate of the probability of the prediction. Hanson, a leading prediction market researcher, was all over the news in 2003, when the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a prediction market proposed by the United States' Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and based on Hanson\u2019s ideas, was canceled after a wave of accusations of incentivizing terrorism, which resulted in the resignation of John Poindexter, head of the DARPA unit responsible for developing the project.\nIn her 2015 book \u201cBlockchain: Blueprint for a New Economy,\u201d dedicated to advanced future applications of distributed ledger technology beyond currency (\u201cBlockchain 1.0\u201d) and smart contracts (\u201cBlockchain 2.0\u201d), futurist Melanie Swan defines futarchy as two-step democracy with voting plus prediction markets.\n\u201cThe first step would be carried out by regular voting processes, the second step via prediction markets,\u201d explains Swan. \u201cPrediction market voting could be by different [cryptocurrencies] or other economically significant tokens. Prediction market voting is investing/speculating, taking a bet on one or the other side of a proposal, betting on the proposal that you want to win. As with random-sampling elections, blockchain technology could more efficiently implement the futarchy concept in an extremely large-scale manner (decentralized, trusted, recorded, pseudonymous.) The futarchy concept is described in shorthand as \u2018vote for values, bet on beliefs,\u2019 an idea initially proposed by economist Robin Hanson and expounded in the blockchain context by Ethereum project founder Vitalik Buterin.\u201d\nAccording to Swan, who founded the Institute for Blockchain Studies to examine the theoretical, philosophical and societal implications of blockchain technology, blockchain-based futarchy could became a common, widespread norm and feature or mechanism for all complex multi-party human decision-making. \u201cOne effect of this could be a completely new level of coordinated human activity that would be orders of magnitude more complex than at present,\u201d notes Swan, cautioning that, of course, any new governance structure including futarchy has ample room for abuse.\n\u201cI\u2019m encouraged that some people might actually try out versions of futarchy,\u201d Hanson told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cIt is perhaps unfortunate that they face especially difficult governance problems. But still, I\u2019d love to see a head-to-head comparison with other mechanisms in most any governance context.\u201d\nHanson isn\u2019t entirely happy with Merkle\u2019s proposal, however. In a blog post titled \u201cMerkle\u2019s Futarchy,\u201d he worries about the possibility that futarchy implementations could ignore or sidestep the cautions and safeguards that were an important part of his original proposal, and criticizes what he sees as weak points of Merkle\u2019s proposed implementation. \u201cI\u2019m happy to see the new interest in futarchy, but I\u2019m also worried that sloppy design may cause failures that are blamed on the overall concept instead of on implementation details,\u201d notes Hanson. \u201cAs recently happened to the DAO concept.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 8}

The organizers want to build a new phase for the web, based on next-generation decentralized systems inspired by the P2P technology that powers file-sharing networks and the distributed ledger technology \u2012 the blockchain \u2012 that powers digital currencies such as bitcoin.\nInternet pioneers such as Ted Nelson, Marc Andreessen and Berners-Lee himself, thought that the internet should have a built-in framework for micropayments. Berners-Lee tried to develop a micropayments system for the web through the W3C in the \u201890s, but the idea so far hasn\u2019t been implemented.\u00a0\nIn 2015 the W3C restarted its work on an overall web payments architecture and produced initial drafts, which make only incidental mentions of Bitcoin and distributed ledger technologies. However, it\u2019s difficult to escape the fact that digital currencies based on distributed ledgers are the only form of internet-native payment system that exists, works and effectively implements one-click payments. It\u2019s also worth noting that, besides micropayments, distributed ledgers show potential for contributing to many other aspects of next-generation, decentralized web technology.\nNow, it appears that the W3C intends to become more involved with distributed ledger technology as a foundational element of tomorrow\u2019s web. On June 29 and 30, the W3C held a workshop, titled \u201cBlockchains and the Web,\u201d for blockchain and web experts to discuss what needs to happen to integrate blockchains into the web.\nThe workshop was held at MIT Media Lab, an organization that seems to be assuming a de-facto leadership role in the technical development of Bitcoin, and perhaps in next-generation web technology as well. It\u2019s too early, though, to think of firm W3C standards for interoperable distributed ledgers.\n\u201cThis is an exploratory workshop; our goal is to start the conversation in the context of features for the web and to review critical questions for incubation,\u201d cautions the workshop announcement. \u201cWe do not foresee immediate standardization work.\u201d\nIn line with this exploratory approach, the workshop announcement is essentially a list of preliminary questions, such as: What emerging capabilities could blockchains enable for the Web, such as distributed identity management? With the proliferation of different approaches and technology stacks (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Hyperledger), is there a need for interchange formats, protocols or APIs to share transaction data across services and stacks or between public and private networks? What timelines make sense for looking at standardization for web-centric aspects of blockchain technologies? What is the relationship to payments, including W3C's Web Payments work?\n\u201cBlockchains and distributed ledgers have captured the imagination of innovators across many industries and government, opening up new capabilities for payments, smart contracts, identity, deeds, patents, correspondence and anything a user might want to have as a verifiable claim on the public record,\u201d noted the W3C. \u201cTo complement W3C's work on Web Payments, we are seeking clear direction on what capabilities blockchains can bring to the web, and what changes are needed to the Web Platform technology stack in order to enable and extend blockchains. The goal of this workshop is to determine opportunities and timelines for blockchain standardization.\u201d\n\u201cMore than 100 of the best and brightest from the standards and blockchain worlds met to discuss potential web standards opportunities for blockchain tech,\u201d says Daniel Buchner, a web platform manager at Microsoft. \u201cThe workshop was a great opportunity to start an important discussion about systems that could move the web far beyond what it is today.\u201d\nRecently, Bitcoin Magazine reported that Microsoft is working on a blockchain-based identity system that could allow people, products, apps and services to interoperate across blockchains, cloud providers and organizations. \u201cThere were many areas of standardization discussed that touched on blockchain-based identity systems, but perhaps the most specific, actionable area of standardization the group identified was extension of the existing Web Auth spec to include the APIs, features and flows necessary to enable blockchain-based identity authentication in browsers,\u201d adds Buchner, noting that other organizations from the W3C workshop will participate in the project.\nA CIO post titled \u201cHighlights from the W3C blockchain workshop at MIT\u201d notes that the workshop was mainly focused on identity systems, blockchain primitives and APIs (browser-like features, wallets, a consensus protocols, standard data formats), licensing of IP, assets and services. The post includes a list of contributions and ideas that emerged from the workshop, illustrated by appealing diagrams developed by Blockstream.\nThough formal standards always lag behind practical innovation and de-facto standards, the growing involvement of the W3C \u2012 the main web standardization body \u2012 in the whole range of web applications of distributed ledger technology seems a positive trend.\nPhoto\u00a0Knight Foundation\u00a0/ Creative Commons", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 8}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nUrbit, the computing platform described as a \u201ccity in the cloud\u201d by its inventors, raised more than $200,000 in four hours through a crowdsale last week. While the crypto-space has seen many spectacular crowd-sales, some more dodgy than others, Urbit has been able to excite leading venture capitalists and executives in the space, including BitGo's Ben Davenport, 21 Inc.'s Balaji Srinivasan and Chaincode Labs' Alex Morcos.\nThe platform, a product by U.S. startup Tlon, sparks curiosity, even though few outside the VC tech elite seem to have a good grasp on exactly what it proposes.\nAccording to Tlon CTO and Urbit inventor Curtis Yarvin: \u201cIf bitcoin is digital money, Urbit is digital land.\u201d\nThe Goal\nThe main problem Urbit intends to solve is the reliance of internet users on servers they do not control. Back in the \u201880s, the internet was designed as a peer-to-peer network but most people now just use it to connect to Facebook, Gmail, Reddit and other centralized services. This means that users are not in full control of their own data, software or identity, instead handing this over to corporate tech giants.\nTlon, instead, envisions a future where users own their own general-purpose cloud computers and socialize by connecting directly to each other. A sort of remake of the internet\u2019s original peer-to-peer vision.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Tlon CEO Galen Wolfe-Pauly explained:\n\n\u201cThe internet has collapsed into this client-server structure \u2012 basically a digital modem. Attempts to fix this have generally been focused on a re-decentralization of the whole internet itself. But we don't think the internet can be fixed this way. The internet is here; it can\u2019t change and it\u2019s not going away. So instead, we want to build a new internet on top of the existing internet.\u201d\n\nUrbit is designed to give users their own interconnected, personal cloud-servers. An Urbit server can store data, run software, connect to other users or just about anything else a cloud-computer would allow. In practice, Urbit runs on top of the Unix operating system typically offered by existing cloud-servers, such as Amazon Web Services. But as opposed to Unix, Urbit promises to one day actually be human-usable. It will not be just for geeks, but for about anyone able to operate an iPhone.\nThe Tech\nUrbit doesn\u2019t get rid of the complexity of the decades-old Unix-Internet platform, which requires a professional sysadmin, by removing it. Rather, Urbit installs a new platform, redesigned from scratch, on top of the old platform.\nAs explained by Yarvin:\n\n\u201cUrbit is designed to replace the current infrastructure, not by removing it, but by painting over it with a new, opaque, unified computing and computation layer. You can think of this as the server-side equivalent of the browser, which replaced OS-level native clients with a Javascript sandbox.\u00a0\n\nThe Urbit stack is a virtual machine, \u201cNock,\u201d which is a page of code; \u201cHoon,\u201d which is a typed functional language; and \u201cArvo,\u201d a functional network OS, which is also a database. The only thing Urbit has in common with 20th-century programming is Unicode and some crypto algorithms.\u201d\nYarvin himself indicated that reinventing all these wheels strikes many programmers as daunting and perhaps unnecessary.\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut if inherited complexity is the reason ordinary people can't control their own general-purpose computing, the easiest path to human simplicity is technical simplicity. The whole Urbit stack, including apps, is only 30,000 lines of code,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd all of it is as dumb as possible.\u201d\n\nAddress Space\nAn important part of Urbit\u2019s architecture is the hierarchical structure of routable address spaces also used for routing. These addresses \u2012 which Urbit calls \u201cships\u201d \u2012 are perhaps best described as a fusion of IP-addresses, domain names and personal pseudonyms.\nShips are divided into tiers named for astronomical bodies. 8-bit galaxies are top-level network infrastructure, and have a network-governance role. 16-bit stars are also network infrastructure but have a less direct governance role. 32-bit planets are the individual level: They\u2019re designed as human identities. And 64-bit moons are designed as clients, bots or connected devices.\nWolfe-Pauly explained:\n\n\u201cUrbit is initially centralized to its 256 galaxies but decentralizes itself. Each tier of ships signs the initial key for the tier below it. Then each key signs its own updates, creating a certificate chain. Like bitcoin, a ship is a transferable cryptographic asset. Unlike bitcoin, it isn\u2019t fungible, so it can\u2019t be sold on present-day exchanges. Like actual real estate, Urbit is highly illiquid and probably not for the short-term trader.\u201d\n\nThis structure also creates digital scarcity. Scarcity is needed, the inventors believe, to give the \u201cname spaces\u201d value at all, which, in turn, counters spam and other abuse: No one would want to have their valuable address blocked by other Urbit users as the specific address could decrease in value.\nCrowdsale\nOf course, the scarcity of address space allows Tlon to raise the money needed to fund development of the platform. In the open crowdsale last week, 1.6 percent of all stars were sold, netting Tlon more than $200,000 to continue development.\n\u201cSuppose you're creating the internet,\u201d Yarvin explained. \u201cBut it's 2016 and DARPA isn't funding you. How do you fund yourself? You sell off giant blocks of IP address space, defining them as cryptographic titles. And a network in which addresses are a limited resource, but treated as cryptographic property, actually works much better in a lot of ways.\u201d\nWhile Urbit currently is still centralized, it's managed and developed by Tlon and all galaxies are basically \u201cpre-mined\u201d (though there is no actual mining in Urbit) \u2013 the galaxies and stars are designed to become independent and self-governing. Ship owners will be able to vote through a sort of proof-of-stake system to determine the policy and future of their \u201cdigital cities.\u201d\nThe vision, prospects and promises are big. But as the founders admit, Urbit is a work in progress. Making it an actual useful system for human beings will take many man-hours and lots of experimentation. And, like many projects in the crypto-space, the outcome may very well turn out to be binary: a huge success or a hopelessly failed experiment.", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 11}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe European Commission published a new directive draft last week proposing to extend strict anti-money laundering (AML) regulation to both virtual currency exchange services and custodial wallet providers. Intended to counter \u201cmoney launderers, tax evaders, terrorists, fraudsters and other criminals,\u201d the directive could mean that many Bitcoin companies in the E.U. will have to apply know your customer (KYC) types of checks on their users.\nThe proposal, which particularly focuses on terrorist financing, intends to restrict the anonymous use of virtual currencies, presumably referring to bitcoin and altcoins.\nAccording to the draft published by the executive arm of the European Union:\n\n\u201cTransactions with virtual currencies benefit from a higher degree of anonymity than classical financial fund transfers and therefore entail a risk that virtual currency may be used by terrorist organizations to conceal financial transfers. Possible further risks relate to the irreversibility of transactions, means of dealing with fraudulent operations, the opaque and technologically complex nature of the industry, and the lack of regulatory safeguards.\u201d\n\nAs such, the European Commission recommends that existing anti-money laundering regulation should apply to virtual currency services, and, in particular, to exchanges and custodial wallet providers.\nThe European Commission writes:\n\n\u201c[T]o prevent misuse of virtual currencies for money laundering and terrorist financing purposes, the Commission proposes to bring virtual currency exchange platforms and custodian wallet providers under the scope of the Anti-Money Laundering Directive. These entities will have to apply customer due diligence controls when exchanging virtual for real currencies, ending the anonymity associated with such exchanges.\u201d\n\nIf adopted, Bitcoin companies will be required to collect their customers\u2019 identity documents; something several of them already do, though it is currently not mandatory. (In some cases financial partners \u2012 such as banks \u2012 do require Bitcoin companies to apply KYC in order to get an account.) Additionally, Bitcoin companies will need to monitor transactions on their platforms and report suspicious activity.\nInterpretation\nThe proposal does not go into detail explaining which kinds of services will be affected. It's clear that the directive would apply to Bitcoin exchanges and wallet services that control customer funds. Whether it also includes exchanges or wallet providers that do not hold onto private keys, or not all private keys in case of multisig-addresses, is not as clear. (EDCAB\u2019s Si\u00e2n Jones thinks it might; Coin Center's Jerry Brito thinks not.)\nThe European Commission, which says that the directive is drafted in accordance with \u201crelevant virtual currencies market players,\u201d including \u201cexchange platforms, wallet providers [and] a representative group of virtual currency stakeholders,\u201d maintains that the regulation should not hamper virtual currency adoption \u2013 and perhaps might even further it.\nThe draft proposal reads:\n\n\u201cThe proposed measure has no negative effects on the benefits and technological advances presented by the distributed ledger technology underlying virtual currencies. [\u2026] The credibility of virtual currencies will not rise if they are used for criminal purposes. In this context, anonymity will become more a hindrance than an asset for virtual currencies taking up and their potential benefits to spread.\u201d\n\nIndividual Users\nFor now, the directive targets only exchanges and wallet providers \u2013 not individual Bitcoin users. Toward the end of the document, however, the European Commission acknowledges that regulating exchanges and wallet providers may ultimately not suffice to prevent nefarious use of virtual currencies. After all, Bitcoin users can run wallet software on their own computer or smartphone, thereby not requiring any wallet provider at all.\nThe draft therefore suggests that addresses may have to be tied to individual users at some point in the future as well:\n\n\u201cThe inclusion of virtual exchange platforms and custodian wallet providers will not entirely address the issue of anonymity attached to virtual currency transactions, as a large part of the virtual currency environment will remain anonymous because users can also transact without exchange platforms or custodian wallet providers. To combat the risks related to the anonymity, national Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) should be able to associate virtual currency addresses to the identity of the owner of virtual currencies. In addition, the possibility to allow users to self-declare to designated authorities on a voluntary basis should be further assessed.\u201d\n\nThe proposal must still be approved by the European Parliament and member states, and could be enforced as soon as January 1, 2017. Once approved, EU member states are expected to implement national laws based on the directive. The proposal is still in its draft-stage, however, meaning there is still room for alterations based on input from individual member states.", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 13}

It is a sound enough idea, a contract that will rewrite itself according to commercial circumstances surrounding it by using a complex series of rules embedded in its coding.\u00a0\nThe ideas behind it are equally as sound theoretically. Less input from the contracting parties means that smart contracts will come into being quicker and, therefore, allow for transactions to be raised and completed more quickly. \u00a0Also, the fact that smart contracts require less input from both the parties involved and their lawyers, will make commerce more fluid and more cost-effective both in terms of time and legal fees.\nThe only potential problem is that once you get past the theory and examine the practical with a legal eye, you start to see that it is actually difficult to consider a smart contract as either smart or a contract and that it is probably more accurate to drop the term smart contract; instead, referring to them as automated computer code.\u00a0\nFor those among you who think my stance may come from the fact that I\u2019m a solicitor who is worried smart contracts might eat into my practice, I shall explain why smart contracts \u2013 in their current form at least \u2013 are not fit for purpose. \u00a0\nThe first thing to consider is why a contract is required in the first place: It is there to protect the personal and/or commercial interests of the parties, which means it is contingent on two key sources:\n\nThe prior agreement of the parties on the heads of terms included within the contract.\nThe legal experience required to turn those heads of terms into a viable legal document.\n\nOnce that contract is in place, coding could provide continued support for that contract and, indeed, for similar contracts involving similar terms for similar transactions. I would even suggest the code could probably even be taught to make small alterations as long as those alterations were foreseeable and logical. \u00a0\nHowever, I am highly cynical about a code\u2019s ability to make more complex binding/sustainable legal decisions required to build the foundations of a robust commercial contract or negotiate the best possible terms for all of the parties involved. This means that in the first instance at least, a lawyer will still need to be involved.\nAlso, code works on linear decision-making and probability, but more often than not, finding the right answer to settle a particular contractual nuance is a much more lateral process and requires a level of creativity and flexibility that can come only from real-life experience. \u00a0To inject that depth of practical experience into code is, I would suggest, a nigh on impossible task.\u00a0\nThis takes us on to another potential failing: If things turn sour between the contracted parties, who is there to sort things out? There is a common myth that a smart contract cannot be litigated, but I would disagree. As long as the heads of terms that sit behind the contracts are clear \u2013 and have clearly been accepted by the parties \u2013 there is scope to litigate if the code is deemed not to be fit for purpose or has affected the transactions it is meant to support and/or the payments associated with those transactions.\nThis is, however, where things could get more complicated. \u00a0As there is currently no international internet law, the original contract would have to set out the jurisdictions of the parties and which country\u2019s law the contract is reliant upon. Again, these aren\u2019t decisions that code can make, so these definitions and agreements would have to be made by people, quite possibly with specialist legal advice. \u00a0\nAnd that is why I don\u2019t believe that smart contracts in their current form can be considered smart or contracts. As I said earlier, I don\u2019t want this to come across as just another defensive letter of self-preservation from a lawyer in fear of losing fees. As an experienced litigator who has fought for years to ensure my clients always get the best possible protection from their commercial contracts, it concerns me is that an idea or even just a buzzword could lead numerous businesses into difficult and potentially very costly situations just because they had bought into the next big thing.", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 11}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe European Commission\u00a0published a\u00a0draft directive last week proposing to amend existing anti-money laundering rules to include virtual currencies such as bitcoin. If adopted, exchanges as well as custodial wallet providers will need to collect customers\u2019 identity documents and report suspicious activity on their platform to relevant authorities.\nIn an attempt to avoid regulatory overreach, a group of Dutch Bitcoin startups and experts is now reaching out to the Dutch Ministry of FInance offering their expertise, hoping to potentially adjust the proposed directive amendment.\nUncertainty still exists over the extent of the proposed directive; in particular over what are considered \u201cwallet providers offering custodial services of credentials necessary to access virtual currencies.\u201d\nSome legal experts\u00a0maintain that the amendment would concern only companies that fully control customer funds (such as\u00a0Circle or\u00a0Xapo). Other legal experts\u00a0think it may also apply to wallet providers that merely hold onto a single key of a multisig-address (such as BlockTrail or\u00a0GreenAddress); an interpretation that was confirmed by German Bitcoin-news site\u00a0bitcoinblog.de, which reportedly spoke with an E.U.-representative.\nAdditionally, Bitcoin-services that are not really designed as wallets but do hold private keys (such as ChangeTip and\u00a0SatoshiPay), may fall under the new regulation as well.\nJouke Hofman is CEO of Bitcoin-brokerage\u00a0Bitonic and exchange\u00a0BL3P and initiated the outreach to the Dutch Ministry of Finance as well as Dutch Bitcoin-startups and experts.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Hofman explained:\n\n\u201cUnder the current provision, it's not that clear who or what the regulation applies to, exactly. It covers wallet providers that hold onto private keys of their users. But does it also include wallet providers that hold onto one key for a two-of-three multisig address? What if bitcoins are time-locked and wallet providers cannot spend the funds now, but perhaps in the future? And if the regulation applies to any key holder, where does the definition of a wallet provider begin? Could the regulation perhaps even apply to Lightning Network nodes? It's important these types of nuances are taken into account when drafting new regulation for an upcoming technology that's still very much in development.\u201d\n\nThis sentiment is shared by Corn\u00e9 Plooy, the main developer behind\u00a0Amiko Pay, a payment channel network sharing similarities with the Lightning Network. As part of the initiative, Plooy is reaching out to the Dutch Ministry of Finance in hopes of giving them a better understanding of the technological potential of the Bitcoin protocol \u2013 and possible consequences of regulatory overreach.\nExplaining his perspective to Bitcoin Magazine, Plooy said:\n\n\u201cA major difference between financial technology and other information technology like software or websites is that financial technology usually cannot be deployed without approval of existing parties like banks. I believe this is what stops the financial sector from having the same level of innovation as other IT-sectors. This is where Bitcoin makes a huge difference. It allows for a peer-to-peer economy, without dependence on large organizations. There is no longer a strong separation between the role of a consumer and that of a service provider. Anyone with a good idea and a bit of expertise can make their idea a reality, giving a huge boost to fintech innovation.\u201d\n\nHe continued:\n\n\u201cRegulation may destroy that advantage. What would have become of Google if it had to perform a suspicious activities check on every website it linked to? What will happen to the Lightning Network if every user has to comply with AML/KYC regulations? That is a real concern if multisig key holders are considered wallet providers in the newly proposed E.U. regulations. Privacy concerns aside, individuals don't have the resources to apply these sorts of checks.\u201d\n\nIf the directive is adopted without sufficient provisions for startups and room for innovation, Hofman and Plooy, who are accompanied by representatives from BlockTrail and\u00a0Bitmymoney, worry it will stifle Bitcoin innovation \u2013 or drive that same innovation out of the European Union. They maintain that any regulation targeted at wallet providers should be withheld for now, and they prefer a so-called \u201cwait and see\u201d approach in this domain.\n\u201cThe core issue is that regulation cannot take into account the advantages or demands of future inventions, because we don't know what those future inventions will be,\u201d Plooy explained. \u201cWe need a space where new ideas can be deployed, where they can grow in freedom, so they can prove their use to the world. If the E.U. doesn't provide that space, innovation will happen elsewhere, and Europe will always stay behind.\u201d\nOn top of that, the initiative questions whether the proposed regulation will accomplish the stated goals in the first place. In the directive draft, the European Commission argues it needs to impose KYC-checks on the gatekeepers of virtual currencies in order to prevent criminal abuse. But since Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer protocol by design, it's unclear that regulating specific types of wallet services will have any effect in that regard at all, they argue.\n\u201cWe concede that on- and off-ramps \u2013 the exchanges and brokerages where Bitcoin is traded for fiat currency and back \u2013 can be considered gatekeepers of the system. We also understand these may need to be regulated to some extent,\u201d Hofman explained. \u201cBut this directive proposes to apply full KYC/AML-checks on certain wallet providers. We don't believe these companies work as gatekeepers at all, since anyone can trivially send, receive and store Bitcoin without these companies anyway. They're service providers, sure \u2013 but not gatekeepers.\u201d\nAs the initiative limits itself to reaching out to Dutch policymakers, Hofman hopes Bitcoin industry players in other E.U. member states undertake similar steps. He has been reaching out to several of them over the past week, suggesting they may want to take action as well.\n\u201cIn the end, I think it is mostly a lack of understanding of the underlying principles of Bitcoin \u2013 and in particular the pay-scripts \u2013 that had the European Commission come up with this phrasing,\u201d \u00a0Hofman said. \u201cBut since it is a draft, there are still ways to alter the content. All E.U. member states will have input on the paper, so other European companies that believe the directive needs to be adjusted should contact relevant government officials and perhaps offer them their knowledge. I don't know for sure if this will actually help, but at least we need to try.\u201d\nThe European Parliament and the European Council must approve of the directive for it to be adopted. If any adjustments are to be made to the draft proposal, it will need to happen on short notice for regulatory standards: The proposal is scheduled to be enforced by 2017, while the council will discuss the draft as early as next week. Once adopted, E.U. member states are expected to implement national laws based on the directive.\nThe author of this article was approached for \u2013 and has provided \u2013 input to a letter addressed to the Dutch Ministry of Finance drafted by the initiative as well.", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 14}
{"title": "Why Do Some Bitcoin Mining Pools Mine Empty Blocks?", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/why-do-some-bitcoin-mining-pools-mine-empty-blocks-1468337739/", "birthday": "Jul 12, 2016  11:35 AM EST", "date": "2016-07-12 16:35:00", "content": "Blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain have a maximum size of 1 MB. Proof of work difficulty is calibrated so 1 block is created every 10 minutes. It is generally accepted a miner would want to maximise the number of transactions it includes in a block as it collects the transaction fees. Logically, with the growing popularity of Bitcoin, the average block size is getting closer to its limit.\n\nIn this environment, it is surprising to see a number of empty blocks being mined. An empty block is not entirely empty, it has 1 transaction : the coinbase transaction which allocates the mining reward to the miner (12.5 bitcoins at the time of writing). It is important to know, that empty blocks are not easier, cheaper or quicker to mine than full blocks. The ratio of empty blocks varies considerably from one mining pool to the other. For instance, Bitfury, BitClub Network and Kano CKPool do not mine empty blocks.\n\nWhy are there empty blocks?\nWhen a mining pool receives a new block from a competitor, it needs to perform a few actions: download the full block, validate its transactions and define a new block to mine on. During this - albeit short -interval, so as not to waste hashing power, they start mining a new block. Only the coinbase transaction is included, so the previous block does not invalidate theirs with a duplicate transaction.\nThis validationless mining (or SPV mining) phenomenon can be seen on the Kaiko blockchain page, with empty blocks being mined just after a normal block, when the mempool is far from empty.\nThe number of empty blocks is dropping\n\nThe share of empty blocks has fallen across the board over the past few months, although the timing has not been quite the same for all pools. The main theory behind this is the improvements made in the mining software, especially Bitcoin Core 0.12, which reduces the time between the validation of a block mined by another pool and the mining of a new non empty block\nThese improvements included (but were not limited to):\nImprovement which allowed for pre calculation of some of the work required for a miner to validate all the transactions in the block (rather than doing it at block creation time)Relay Network configuration improvements which includes a technically simplified (and quicker) prioritisation of transactions to help miners decide which transactions to include in a blockBitcoin Core GetBlockTemplate - improvement by which the individual miner requests the composition of the block to mine- optimizations. More details are available here: https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/02/23/release-0.12.0/\nIs it bad?\nThe whole point of the Bitcoin network is to process transactions. Therefore, empty blocks are often criticised as \u201cbad behaviour\u201d as creating very little value for the network by accelerating disinflation and stealing from \u201chonest\u201d miners.\nHowever, it can also be considered as counter-balancing the centralisation tendency of the network: a pool which wins a block can start mining the next block immediately since they already know which transactions were included in the block. Whereas other miners first have to download the transactions, and then generate a new block which doesn\u2019t include any of them. The ability to mine with just the header, could be considered to limit the benefits of centralisation.\nTechnically, it could be easily prevented by including, for example, a hash of the current coinbase concatenated with all the previous transactions in the block header. The recent fall in the number of empty blocks shows that the issue can be contained through improvements in the protocol which make mining empty blocks less interesting. Additionally, the gradual decrease of the block reward and the increased reliance on transaction fees will likely make mining empty blocks unprofitable over time.

He is a philosopher working outside of academia and the host of the Patterson in Pursuit podcast. You can follow his work at steve-patterson.com.\nEditor's note: This is a guest post by Steve Patterson and the opinions offered are those of the author alone.\nUntil recently, I\u2019ve remained undecided about the DAO failure. Should Ethereum soft fork, hard fork or do nothing? I have a tentative conclusion: the best reaction is to do nothing. Let me explain why.\nFirst, we have to lay out the facts. Ethereum and the DAO are two separate things. Ethereum is the underlying computer protocol, with its own unique blockchain. It exists for one purpose: to allow code to be executed across a gigantic network of computers.\nThe DAO is one of the first programs to run on the Ethereum network. \u201cDAO\u201d stands for \u201cDecentralized Autonomous Organization\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s a new type of company, specifically designed to be run as an \u201cautonomous organization.\u201d\nThis is crucial: the DAO is a company. It\u2019s a company without humans. That\u2019s the point. No part of the DAO exists outside of the code. The company is the code. Investors can choose to fund the company by sending it money.\nThe DAO was not hacked. It simply executed its code, and by doing so, it went bankrupt. It was a bad business model. The DAO was only a failure from the standpoint of its investors. From a technical standpoint, the DAO worked seamlessly.\nMt. Gox 2.0\nThe DAO bankruptcy most closely resembles the Mt. Gox bankruptcy. Within the Bitcoin community, everybody knows how the media misunderstood the failure of Mt. Gox. The headlines read, \u201cBitcoin Goes Bankrupt!\u201d or \u201cBitcoin Hacked!\u201d But of course that wasn\u2019t true. Mt. Gox was a company working \u201con top of\u201d the Bitcoin protocol.\nPeople trusted Mt. Gox, the company, and unfortunately it went bankrupt. Those participants lost a lot of money. It\u2019s a shame. A lot was learned from that failure, but, in the long run, it was probably a good thing.\nThe same is true of the DAO. People trusted it without investigation. They put their money in the hands of a company, and that company went bankrupt. The underlying Ethereum code had nothing to do with it (as far as I understand.)\nTherefore it seems inappropriate for the Ethereum community to entertain the idea of a hard fork. Or even a soft fork, for that matter.\nYes, a lot of money was lost. But not because of a technical problem with Ethereum. It would have been inappropriate to hard fork Bitcoin just because Mt. Gox went bankrupt and people lost a lot of money.\nWhat strikes me as even more off-putting is the fact that Ethereum developers had money invested in the DAO. Imagine if a Bitcoin company went bankrupt, and then the developers planned a hard fork to get their money back \u2013 because they are personally invested in the company! Even though the code was fine and everything executed as it should, they lost out \u2013 and it seems odd to permit a hard fork because of it. It\u2019s a dangerous precedent.\nA New 51 Percent Attack\nUltimately, it\u2019s not the developers who decide if Ethereum will fork. It\u2019s the miners. That\u2019s a good thing. However, we\u2019re witnessing a new type of attack on blockchain technology \u2013 the internal 51 percent attack.\nPeople discussing a hard fork aren\u2019t talking about fixing a glitch. They are talking about recouping lost funds that came from an ugly bankruptcy. They invested in a company; that company went bankrupt; and now they are seeking out their money in the blockchain to take it back by force.\nAgain, that seems like a dangerous precedent. \u00a0Yes, it\u2019s democratic, but that\u2019s not always a good thing.\nStock Glitch Versus Bankruptcy\nLet\u2019s say you open a Scottrade account and deposit $1,000. Now, imagine two scenarios:\n1) Scottrade has a technical glitch where you lose your money.\n2) A company you bought stock in has a technical glitch; they go bankrupt because of it; and you lose all your money.\nIn Scenario 1, it makes sense that Scottrade would ameliorate the problem \u2013 i.e. they would \u201chard fork\u201d their own software and return your funds.\nIn Scenario 2, it does not make sense that Scottrade would ameliorate the problem. It would be outrageous if they \u201chard forked\u201d their software to make it appear as if you didn\u2019t invest money in the first place!\nScottrade is responsible for technical glitches on their end. Ethereum is responsible for technical glitches on their end. Neither should change their code to erase their customers\u2019 bad bets.\nContracts, Codes, Knocks on the Door\nOne more analogy, more related to the technical failure of the DAO.\nImagine you voluntarily enter into a contract. The contract reads, \u201cEvery time your neighbor knocks on the door, your bank account will automatically send $5 from your account to his.\u201d\nImmediately after signing the contract, everything seems fine. Until your neighbor keeps knocking on the door. You wake up the next day, and your bank account is empty. Who\u2019s responsible? Did your neighbor steal from you? Did he hack the system?\nFrom my understanding, that\u2019s essentially what happened with the DAO. The company gave out money for \u201csplitting,\u201d and one person kept splitting until the bank account was empty. That\u2019s a bad business model, demonstrated by their bankruptcy.\nDoes it seem reasonable, then, to fork the Ethereum code to blacklist his address \u2013 or even more extreme, to erase part of the blockchain to take the money back? I\u2019m not saying the guy was morally innocent. But given the point of autonomous organizations and smart contracts, I don\u2019t think it was criminal.\nOn the Other Hand\nI don\u2019t want to imply this issue is simple. It\u2019s not. It does make sense that \u2013 given the extreme newness of the technology \u2013 big mistakes could be erased by the community. It\u2019s a dangerous precedent, yes, but Ethereum is still extremely small-scale. Hard forking because of a bum contract would be completely inappropriate in the future, but right now, it seems less damaging to the credibility of the community. I don\u2019t support it, but it probably wouldn\u2019t be a death sentence.\nFrankly, it would be much easier if the bug came from the Ethereum code itself. But that\u2019s not the circumstance.\nI hope that a few good principles will come from this failure. First, in the future, it\u2019s a very bad idea to invest a huge amount of money into something so radically experimental. Second, if the Ethereum community decides to recover their own funds via hard fork, I hope they commit to this being a once-in-a-lifetime event. Their credibility relies on it.\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 20}

The wallet has been developed in partnership with Palo Alto-based blockchain security company BitGo.\nAccording to a press release by the company, the wallet will provide a mobile money solution to users in the Caribbean where access to traditional banking is limited. The wallet combines elements of social messaging platforms with remittance via Bitcoin. It allows senders and receivers to chat with each other and also comes with the ability to top-up mobile phones with prepaid minutes anywhere within the Caribbean.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Karsten Becker, CEO of Caricoin, said wallet was developed as an alternative to the traditional banking services for the Caribbean where, according to World Bank 2015 Global Findex Report, nearly 50 percent of the population is unbanked.\n\u201cAccess to banking services in the Caribbean is difficult at best\u201d Becker said. \u201cThe KYC [know-your-customer] process is extremely difficult and antiquated, and out of reach of most people, and the process for small businesses to open a account can take up to 90 days.\u201d\u00a0\nBecker said that unlike traditional banking services where opening an account can take days due to the KYC regulations, the wallet allows anyone to instantly open an account and make digital payments.\u00a0\n\u201cIn comparison to banks and the mobile money platforms which are struggling to take off due to over-regulation, we make it extremely easy for anyone to open a account \u2012 all you really need is a mobile phone with an internet connection,\u201d Becker said.\u00a0\nHe also added that the wallet will help users in the rural areas of the Caribbean where people currently have to travel to pay their utility bills by allowing them to pay bills from within the wallet.\u00a0\n\u201cIn some areas of rural Jamaica it can cost more than the amount on the utility bill just to travel to go and pay the bill,\u201d Becker said. \u201cMaking payments easier without the red tape is just one of the ways our wallet can help people in the Caribbean, something that saves money for both the people and the companies they support with their hard work.\u201d\u00a0\nAdditionally, the company is also working on developing a zero-cost remittance feature to be included in the wallet. According to a world bank report\u00a0the remittance fees alone in the Caribbean region amount to over $800 million dollars per year.\nBy allowing users to easily buy and sell bitcoin from within their wallet this feature will allow members of the Caribbean community working overseas to send money back home without having to incur a remittance fee.The transferred funds can be used to pay utility bills or be cashed out to local currency using bitcoin ATMs.\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 20}

WB21 customers can now send Bitcoin to make real time account deposits in any of the 18 currencies supported by the bank.\n\u201cA bank accepting Bitcoin is quite unusual, however it makes total sense for us and provides huge benefits to our clients,\u201d said WB21 founder and CEO Michael Gastauer. \u201cWe are offering instant account opening in 180 countries. The problem some of our clients face is how to make deposits if we don't maintain a local account in their country. By accepting Bitcoin, our customers can instantly transfer funds to their WB21 account from any country in the world.\u201d\nWB21 is a group of financial institutions licensed in various countries. The first legal entity established under the WB21 Group was WB21 Inc., founded by Gastauer in 2014 in Palo Alto, California. In 2015, WB21 GmbH was incorporated in Zug, Switzerland, and received its eMoney license from the Swiss authorities. In 2016, WB21 Ltd. was incorporated in London and WB21 Limited was incorporated in Hong Kong.\nThe U.K. company, which applied for a Payment Institution license with the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), operates the European headquarters of the group. The Swiss company operates as card-issuing center, and the Hong Kong company operates as a stored value facility under the local regulations. The U.S. company provides software development services to the entire group.\nOpening a bank account can be difficult if the customer is not in the same country as the bank, and operating the account can be costly. The WB21 team decided to create a solution that redefines banking on a global scale. \u201cWe decided to create the ultimate solution in digital banking, a global solution for people and businesses that want to open accounts in minutes, transfer money in real time and pay less in banking fees,\u201d states the WB21 website.\n\u201cWB21 is offering a real time, online account opening for private and business customers in 180 countries,\u201d notes the WB21 press release. \u201cWB21 developed its own fully compliant customer identification software which allows customers a frictionless boarding process in less than five minutes.\u201d Thanks to its user-friendliness and convenience, WB21 is growing fast. The bank currently has more than 650,000 customers, and a monthly payment volume of more than $400 million.\nTo test these claims, this writer opened a WB21 account from Europe. Opening the account, submitting scanned documents for proof of identity and proof of address, and having the documents verified, took minutes indeed.\nBitPay will act as payment processor for WB21 customer deposits in Bitcoin.\n\u201cWB21 is paving the way for some exciting changes in online banking, and their decision to accept Bitcoin is a great example of how innovation is changing the finance sector,\" said BitPay's Chief Commercial Officer Sonny Singh. \"Consumers with Bitcoin don't have to be limited by the country-by-country limitations of legacy payments \u2012 and now WB21 will allow them greater flexibility for making payments in up to 18 different currencies.\"\n\u201cAs soon as they send Bitcoin to our address, we credit the value in the currency the customer has selected to their checking account,\u201d added Gastauer. \u201cThe funds are instantly available on the account and can be sent out by wire transfers or spent with a WB21 debit card. The process to convert Bitcoin into cash on a bank account is the fastest I am aware of. For us, the acceptance of Bitcoin is a great way to support our global rollout and improve customers\u2019 fund-depositing experience.\u201d\n\u201cAlthough WB21 isn\u2019t a huge bank by any stretch, it is nonetheless a fully licensed bank operating in multiple countries in compliance with all regulatory restrictions,\u201d notes SiliconAngle.\u00a0\nWhile innovative \u2012 and potentially disruptive \u2012 financial services like WB21\u2019s should be thoroughly field-tested before forming an opinion. At first glance, WB21 seems a godsend for the growing population of global \u201ctechnomads\u201d who have little patience for paperwork and earn part of their living in Bitcoin.\nThe new Bitcoin deposit option, added to the possibility to open an account in minutes from anywhere and the availability of debit cards, offers a convenient solution to pay in Bitcoin at both online and physical locations. Efficient global banking services linked to a global digital currency could seriously disrupt the current nation-based banking system.\nThere are other debit cards that can be funded with Bitcoin, but those are often limited to residents of one or a few countries. The WB21 debit card \u2012 a virtual or physical MasterCard \u2012 is available almost globally and can be used to pay or withdraw cash at ATMs worldwide. The option to order a credit card online currently is disabled, so customers who want to request a debit card are invited to contact WB21\u2019s support. The support staff say that, due to a high demand, WB21 is currently experiencing delays with manufacturing debit cards.", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 16}

Many believe that private blockchains currently being considered are not blockchains, but rather, distributed ledger technology which has already existed.\nOthers believe private blockchains could provide solutions to many financial enterprise problems that Bitcoin does not, such as abiding by regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) laws.\u00a0\nThe Hyperledger project from the Linux Foundation, R3CEV\u2019s Corda, and the Gem Health network are just several of the different private blockchain projects under development.\u00a0\nBitcoin Magazine spoke with \u00a0some well-known blockchain thinkers on their opinions of what the uses for a private blockchain might be.\u00a0\nJeff Garzik, co-founder at Bloq:\n\u201cIn general, Bloq feels it is important to build and support software that works on both public and private blockchains. This connects the private blockchain customer with public blockchain innovation, developers and new applications.\u201d\u00a0\nBrian Hoffman, founder of OpenBazaar:\n\u201cI'll preface my comments with the fact that OpenBazaar is a public blockchain Bitcoin-only project, so I don't have tons of experience with private blockchains. I personally don't believe that private blockchains provide much added value above a privileged database and have yet to really see a necessary use case for them.\u201d\u00a0\nDan Wasyluk, Syscoin team manager:\u00a0\n\"Private blockchains provide interesting opportunities for businesses to leverage [their] trustless and transparent foundation for internal and business-to-business use cases. With the advent of smart contracts, this technology could eventually replace many centralized businesses.\"\nMax Kordek, Lisk CEO:\n\"I see quite a few use cases for private blockchains, and they definitely have their place. Traditional institutions won't switch to a completely public blockchain from one day to the other. A private blockchain is a great first step towards a more cryptographic future. The biggest advantages of private blockchains in comparison to centralized databases are the cryptographic auditing and known identities. Nobody can tamper with the data, and mistakes can be traced back. In comparison to a public blockchain it is much faster, cheaper and respects the company's privacy. As a conclusion, it's better to rely on a private blockchain than no cryptographic system at all. It has merits and pushes the blockchain terminology into the corporate world, making truly public blockchains a bit more likely for the future.\"\u00a0\nPatrick Dugan, Omni Board Member\nPrivate blockchains, or as I like to call them, shared databases, have a place in improving efficiency for financial institution for back-office settlement processes. They should not be seen as controversial, or part of some dialectic struggle between punks and police. To the extent that the identifying shroud of AML/KYC can be placed into public blockchain metadata (possible in Omni Layer transactions over the Bitcoin blockchain) there may even be interoperability between these two sides of the train tracks. Right now, due to state-granted monopolies to issue credit, most of the world's liquidity is still in banks. However, we believe that in the long-term, public blockchains, especially those based on work, will come to take a more significant part in the \u2018System D\u2019 informal economy, which is where most of the global economic growth will originate.\u201d\u00a0\nEugene Lopin, CEO of CHEX:\n\u201cA private blockchain is hardly different from a traditional database. The term is synonymous with glorified databases. But the advantage is that if they are to ever start adding public nodes to it then it becomes so much more. An open blockchain is the best method for having a trustless ledger. The broader the range of decentralized adoption the better. The Bitcoin blockchain hits all those points.\u00a0\n\u201cFor CHEX, the goal is to have that expandability as an option.\u00a0We plan to start privately and evolve into a regular public blockchain for public cross-verification as demand/volume grows. Whereas, if that's not on the goal, you might as well use one of the many well-established database technologies.\u00a0\n\u201cWe see plans like the R3 Consortium as a counter-productive grab to maintain centralized control. There are already reports and rumors that things aren't going according to plan. The Bitcoin blockchain method will only become better with more of such competition.\u201d\u00a0\nRyan Charles, founder of Yours.Network:\n\u201cPrivate blockchains are valuable to solve efficiency, security and fraud problems within traditional financial institutions, but only incrementally. Private blockchains will not revolutionize the financial system. Public blockchains, however, hold the potential to replace most functions of traditional financial institutions with software, fundamentally reshaping the way the financial system works.\u201d\u00a0\nEric Larchev\u00eaque, CEO of Ledger:\n\u201cLedger enables secure blockchain applications through trusted hardware. Public, private or federated, blockchain technology cannot scale without secure key management, and therefore we are developing solutions for all use cases.\n\u201cWe believe that public blockchains with censorship resistance have the potential to disrupt society, when private blockchains are merely a cost-efficiency tool for banking back offices. One can measure its potential in trillions of dollars, the other in billions. But as they are totally orthogonal, both can coexist in the same time, and therefore there is no need to oppose them as we can often see it.\u201d\u00a0\nAnthony Di Iorio, CEO and founder of Decentral and Jaxx, co-founder of Ethereum and chief digital officer of TMX Group (Toronto Stock Exchange):\n\u201cThe reason why you put up private blockchains is potentially because you want to have control over the participants in the blockchain. So as we have banks and financial institutions, who have to worry heavily about regulations, they can\u2019t use the public blockchains right now because they are open and permission-free, and anyone can participate, and that\u2019s contradictory to the regulations to which they must abide.\n\u201cPrivate blockchains are a way of taking advantage of blockchain technology by setting up groups and participants who can verify transactions internally. That does also put you at the risk of security breaches just like in a centralized system. So you\u2019re at further risk, rather than a public blockchain secured by mining hashing power.\u00a0\n\u201cPrivate blockchains have their uses. They can be faster; they do more transactions without scalability issues. There are security advantages, and also security disadvantages.\u201d\nAndreas M.\u00a0Antonopoulos, author of\u00a0Mastering Bitcoin:\n\u201cThe only reason the banks have gotten to the point of thinking about permissioned ledger is because they finally reached the stage of bargaining, third stage in five stages of grief, for industry they\u2019re about to lose. They start with denial, and the basis of denial is, well, this thing isn\u2019t gonna work, it\u2019s gonna die any day soon, and it doesn\u2019t. And then they say, it\u2019s just silly money and it doesn\u2019t have any value, until it does; and no one else is gonna play with it, except they are; serious investors won\u2019t put money into this, except they did; and it still refuses to die. We go from denial to bargaining. Somewhere in between might be anger, some depression, and eventually they\u2019re going to reach acceptance, but it\u2019s gonna take a long time.\u00a0\n\u201cNot only is decentralization, open protocols, open source, collaborative development and living in the wild a feature of Bitcoin, that\u2019s the whole point. And if you take a permissioned ledger and say, that\u2019s all nice, we like the database part of it, can we have it without the open decentralized P2P [peer-to-peer] open source non-controlled distributed nature of it, well you just threw out the baby with the bathwater.\u201d\u00a0\nVitalik Buterin, co-founder/creator of Ethereum:\n\u201cThe consortium or company running a private blockchain can easily, if desired, change the rules of a blockchain, revert transactions, modify balances, etc. In some cases, e.g. national land registries, this functionality is necessary; there is no way a system would be allowed to exist where Dread Pirate Roberts can have legal ownership rights over a plainly visible piece of land, and so an attempt to create a government-uncontrollable land registry would in practice quickly devolve into one that is not recognized by the government itself\u2026.\n\u201cGiven all of this, it may seem like private blockchains are unquestionably a better choice for institutions. However, even in an institutional context, public blockchains still have a lot of value, and, in fact, this value lies to a substantial degree in the philosophical virtues that advocates of public blockchains have been promoting all along, among the chief of which are freedom, neutrality and openness.\u201d\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 20}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe Lightning Network is probably the most highly anticipated technological innovation that will be deployed on top of Bitcoin. The payment layer, first proposed by Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja about a year ago, promises to support a virtually unlimited number of off-chain transactions among users, at nearly no cost \u2013 while leveraging the security offered by Bitcoin.\nAt least three companies \u2013 Poon and Dryja's Lightning, Blockstream and Blockchain \u2013 are currently working on implementations of the technology. But few outside this small technological frontline fully grasp how the \u201cfuture of micropayments\u201d is set to boost Bitcoin\u2019s capabilities.\nIn this three-part series, Bitcoin Magazine lays out the basic building blocks of the Lightning Network, and shows how they fit together to realize this upcoming protocol layer.\nThe first part of this series covered basic building blocks, and explained how these are used to establish bidirectional payment channels. The second part explained how a network is formed, and how Hash Timelock Contracts (HTLCs) link different channels in the network together. This third and final part of the series explains how HTLCs are placed inside bidirectional payment channels to ensure transactions can occur fully off-chain.\nThe Lightning Network\nSo far, Alice and Bob opened a bidirectional payment channel, which they both funded with five bitcoins. They've made two transactions back and forth, and at the current channel state, both Alice and Bob can claim five bitcoins for themselves by \u201cdropping the channel\u201d on the blockchain.\nNow, they want to include an HTLC in the channel. This is to ensure that if Carol claims a bitcoin from Bob in return for her value, Bob is guaranteed a bitcoin from Alice in return.\nLike the previous step, Alice and Bob start by creating a new commitment transaction each. In many ways, these commitment transactions are very similar to previous commitment transactions. They include a normal output, and an output to a funky multisig-address with a CSV (CheckSequenceVerify)-timelock and a special hash-lock. Likewise, as in the previous step, Alice and Bob exchange their old secrets, to effectively invalidate the old channel. And, once exchanged, both Alice and Bob can sign their halves of the commitment transactions and potentially drop them on the blockchain at any time.\nAll familiar territory. Except for one change. Both Alice\u2019s and Bob's commitment transactions now include one new output, worth one bitcoin. (This makes the balance 4-5-1; four for Alice, five for Bob, one for the new output.)\nThis new output is essentially the HTLC. And it's even funkier than all other outputs so far, because there are three ways to unlock it.\nFirst, the new output (in both Alice\u2019s and Bob's commitment transactions) releases the bitcoin on condition that Bob's signature and the value is included in the subsequent transaction. As such, regardless of whether Alice or Bob signs and broadcasts the commitment transaction, only Bob can unlock this output \u2013 if he includes the value. But there is one small difference between the two commitment transactions: if Bob drops the channel, there is a CSV-timelock involved. He will need to wait 1,000 blocks. (If Alice drops the channel he can claim this bitcoin immediately.)\nThe reason Bob has to wait 1,000 blocks if he drops the channel is very similar to what we've seen before: It allows Alice to take this bitcoin in case Bob ever tries to sign and broadcast an old channel state. That's where the second way to unlock the output comes in. Alice can \u201csteal\u201d the funds if she provides Bob's (newest) secret.\u00a0\nTwo can play this game: If Alice ever tries to cheat and broadcast this channel when it's already outdated, Bob can claim this bitcoin using Alice\u2019s secret. (He wouldn't even need to provide the value.)\nAnd third, as with any other HTLC, both commitment transactions also include the usual CLTV time-out fall-back for Alice. If Bob does not include the value in - say - two weeks (for instance because he didn't get it from Carol), Alice can claim her bitcoin back. Again, whether Alice or Bob drops the channel doesn't matter for this option.\nSo where did all this get us?\nBoth Alice and Bob hold a half-valid commitment transaction. If Alice drops her commitment transaction on the blockchain, she immediately sends five bitcoins to Bob. Additionally, she can wait for 1,000 blocks, and claim four bitcoins for herself. Plus, Bob has two weeks to provide the value, and claim the bitcoin in \u201cHTLC output.\u201d (If he doesn't provide the value in two weeks, Alice can claim this bitcoin back.)\nBob, meanwhile, can drop his commitment transaction at any time as well, and immediately send four bitcoins to Alice. Then, he'd have wait 1,000 blocks to claim five more bitcoins from one address, and another bitcoin from the HTLC output if he provides the value. (If he doesn't provide the value in two weeks, Alice can reclaim it.)\nAnd of course, if either Alice or Bob tries to cheat at any point in the future, and sign and broadcast this channel when it\u2019s outdated, both can completely block the other, and steal all bitcoins in the channel.\n\nSettling the Status\nAt this point, Bob is guaranteed to receive a bitcoin in exchange for the value (assuming he has it). All he has to do is sign and broadcast the commitment transaction he got from Alice, include the value in a subsequent transaction, and sign and broadcast that as well.\nAlice knows this. There is no way she can cheat Bob out of his bitcoin \u2013 not even if she found out what the value is through some other means.\nAs such, the two might as well just \u201csettle\u201d outside of the channel. Bob can simply give the value to Alice, and Alice can agree to update the channel status to the more normal state without the HTLC and the time-out deadline.\nAssuming both parties want to keep the channel open, that's what they would naturally do: it's less of a hassle than having to drop the channel on the blockchain.\n\nClosing the Channel\nAnd finally, here's the real power of the Lightning Network:\nAlmost everything described in these three articles will typically never need to hit the Bitcoin blockchain at all.\nIf both Alice and Bob want to close the channel \u201cpeacefully\u201d they can simply create a transaction from the original opening transaction to override everything that happened since the opening transaction. From this closing transaction, they send themselves their fair share of the channel, as represented by the most recent channel state.\nConcretely, this means that if Alice wants to close the channel, she can at this point simply create a transaction paying herself four bitcoins and Bob six, and ask Bob to sign and broadcast the transaction. Since there is no reason for him not to, he will probably cooperate and close the channel.\nIn the end, only two transactions will have been broadcast over the Bitcoin network and included in a block: the opening and the closing transactions. That will hold true even if Alice and Bob transact a million times in between, therefore unloading a huge burden away from the blockchain.\n\nThanks to Rusty Russell and Joseph Poon for information and added feedback.", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 17}

In return, it will offer firms the chance to demonstrate their solutions for real issues facing us as policymakers, together with the valuable \u2018first client\u2019 reference that comes with it. With time, the accelerator will build a network of firms working in this space for the benefit of us and them alike.\u201d\nDistributed ledger technology is an important aspect of emerging fintech. \u201c[If] distributed ledger technology could provide a more efficient way for private sector firms to deliver payments and settle securities, why not apply it to the core of the payments system itself?\u201d Carney says. \u201cThe great promise of distributed ledgers for central banks is their potential to enhance resilience. Distributing the ledger means multiple copies of the system. It can continue to operate if parts get knocked out. That removes the single point of failure risk inherent in a centralized system.\u201d\nHowever, the BoE is not prepared to risk the stability of the financial system by introducing still unproven emerging technologies too early in the payment system. Rather, the BoE intends to thoroughly study the opportunities offered by distributed ledger technologies (DL) as well as the challenges that need to be met before it could be used in central banking. \u201cTo help distinguish DL\u2019s potential from its hype, the Bank has set up our own as a proof of concept,\u201d said Carney.\n\u201cThe distributed ledger is a genuine technological innovation that demonstrates that digital records can be held securely without any central authority,\u201d reads the conclusion of a BoE a research paper titled \u201cInnovations in Payment Technologies and the Emergence of Digital Currencies,\u201d published in 2014. The \u201cOne Bank Research Agenda\u201d discussion paper, issued by the BoE in February 2015, noted that blockchain fintech could reshape the financial industry and called for further research to devise a system that could use distributed ledger technology without compromising a central bank\u2019s ability to control its currency. In September, Bitcoin Magazine reported that Andrew G. Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England (BoE), hinted at the possibility that the U.K. government might issue a digital currency.\u00a0\nThe announcement of the BoE\u2019s fintech accelerator can be seen as one more step toward mainstreaming distributed ledger technology and planning for its introduction in the overall economy. The BoE notes that it is the first central bank to establish a dedicated fintech initiative that works directly with fintech firms on a potentially wide range of topics.\nIn particular, the accelerator will appoint fintech firms to run short proof of concept (POC) projects in a number of priority areas. Each POC will have clearly defined requirements and success indicators.\n\u201cThe selection process will be competitive and transparent,\u201d states the BoE. \u201cWe will make clear our priorities, so that relevant firms can register their interest. The selected firms will have the opportunity to test and demonstrate their products in a live environment, working closely with Bank experts.\u201d\nPwC is one of the first firms to partner with the BoE\u2019s fintech accelerator. The company announced that a team of PwC engineers and specialists in testing worked with the BoE to design and carry out a proof of concept built to explore the potential opportunities and challenges of using distributed ledger technology (DLT) for payments settlement.\n\u201cThis proof of concept brought to life the core features of distributed ledgers, greatly enhancing the bank\u2019s understanding of DLT,\u201d said BoE\u2019s Chief Information Officer Rob Elsey. \u201cWith PwC\u2019s support, the bank\u2019s developers used the latest techniques and software to deliver this POC and have gained further skills that will enable additional rapid proof of concepts in the future.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a significant piece of work and PwC are very excited to have been able to support the bank in developing their first DLT proof of concept, which will enable the Bank to gain a better awareness of DL from both a technology and policy perspective,\u201d added Nick Bouch, financial services data leader and partner at PwC.", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 21}

Certificates openly and transparently registered on the blockchain allow schools and employers to issue digital proof of membership, achievement or completion in a shareable format, which students can use when applying for work or further education.\n\"We live in this world of the rubber-stamp authentication protocol,\" said Forde. \"What's powerful about this project is that all of a sudden, we can start to look at ways to be more reliant on digital certificates. And it's not just about where you've studied; state and city governments have licensed contractors and all sorts of professionals. What if your LinkedIn had a little green check next to your degree, saying it's blockchain-validated? You could trust that information a lot more.\"\nForde also mentioned MedRec, a system built on a private Ethereum network that is a decentralized content-management system for patients\u2019 health care data. It empowers patients to have access to their records across health care providers.\nAnother interesting project is Enigma, a peer-to-peer network being built by MIT students that uses secure, multiparty computation to enable different parties to jointly store and run computations on data while keeping the data completely private. Enigma wants to enable developers to build \u201cprivacy by design,\u201d end-to-end decentralized applications, without a trusted third party.\nOther innovative applications of distributed ledger technologies presented at Exponential Finance 2016 include Abra, Augur, Bitwage, BlockCypher, Bluzelle, Credit Dream, Dwolla (which now has an increased focus on the blockchain), Everledger and Mycelia.\nSince the Digital Currency Initiative has become a central Bitcoin hub and the MIT Media Lab seems to seek a de facto leadership in Bitcoin technical development, it isn\u2019t surprising to see that Forde defends the open, public, permissionless Bitcoin blockchain against the closed, private, \u201cpermissioned\u201d blockchain concept, which is now fashionable among mainstream financial players.\n\"Finance is hard to understand on its own, never mind adding blockchain to the mix,\" said Forde. \"A private blockchain is an intranet, and a public blockchain is the internet. The world was changed by the internet, not a bunch of intranets. Where companies will be disrupted the most is not by private blockchains, but public ones.\" Forde noted that public blockchains such as Bitcoin were the open-source movement that started it all, and private blockchains such as R3 are taking that technology and commercializing it for businesses.\nThe Bitcoin blockchain \u201cis the most secure blockchain in the world,\u201d said Forde in an interview on SingularityHub. \u201cMining Bitcoin, which is kind of like payment processing and validation, secures the blockchain. The most important aspects to keep an eye on are the quantity, diversity, and compute power \u2012 or \u2018hash rate\u2019 \u2012 of independent miners competing to do this every ten minutes.\u201d\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 15}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nUpdated at 1:40pm EST:\nSegregated Witness has been merged into Bitcoin Core.\nOriginal article:\nDuring a Bitcoin Core development meeting on Thursday, it was decided that the code for Segregated Witness (SegWit) is ready to be merged into the master branch. According to Bitcoin Core contributor Eric Lombrozo, the merge is expected to take place in the coming days.\nWhy This Is a Big Deal\nSegregated Witness is an improvement to the Bitcoin protocol that enables a variety of new features and enhancements to the network. Much of the Bitcoin community is excited about this change due to its effective increase to the Bitcoin block size limit to roughly 1.7 megabytes.\nIn addition to the effective block size limit increase, there are also a multitude of other advantages associated with this protocol change. Segregated Witness fixes the well-known transaction malleability issue, which was infamously blamed by former Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles for the loss of user funds. A fix for this longstanding bug in the Bitcoin protocol is also required for the Lightning Network, perhaps Bitcoin\u2019s most promising scaling solution, to function properly.\nMore recently, Bitcoin Core contributor Johnson Lau discussed how SegWit makes it much easier and safer to enable new and old opcodes in Bitcoin. These newly enabled opcodes can offer more flexibility in terms of how funds can be sent on the Bitcoin network. Trust-free betting, atomic cross-blockchain exchange, and a more robust system for multisignature addresses are three examples of new features Lau is attempting to bring to Bitcoin via new opcodes.\nIn terms of why Segregated Witness is a big deal, Lombrozo told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n\u201cSegWit represents the most significant improvement to the Bitcoin protocol to date, solving several problems with the protocol's original design and adding an extensibility layer atop Bitcoin to support larger scale and more sophisticated smart contract applications.\u201d\n\nCode Will Not Be Active in 0.13 Release\nAlthough Segregated Witness code is expected to be merged into Bitcoin Core in the coming days, it will not be activated on the network until some later date. SegWit code will be included in the upcoming 0.13 release of Bitcoin Core; however, the code that allows miners to signal their support for the protocol change (and activate it once 95 percent of miners are on board) will be included in a later release \u2012 likely Bitcoin Core 0.13.1.\nAccording to Lombrozo, there are two reasons for merging SegWit code without activation parameters. First, it will allow greater testing and review to take place among a larger group of Bitcoin enthusiasts, although SegWit is already active on testnet. Second, the Bitcoin Core contributors will not have to keep rebasing SegWit, which requires developers to retest and review a bunch of code any time something is merged that could conflict with this upcoming protocol change.\nPath Toward Activation Is Unclear\nAlthough the code for Segregated Witness will soon be merged, activation may take some time. Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu recently told Bitcoin Magazine that Antpool (a mining pool operated by Bitmain) will not run Segregated Witness code without also having a hard-forking increase in the block size limit included in a release of Bitcoin Core. Antpool represented 18 percent of the network hashrate at the time of this writing.\nSegregated Witness is a soft fork that activates only after 95 percent of the miners have signaled their support for the change. While the development aspect of the SegWit rollout process appears to be nearly over, there still is work to be done on figuring out how this change will be activated in a timely manner.\nWhen asked about the possible issues with activation, Lombrozo responded, \u201cLet\u2019s worry about this\u00a0after the merge.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 24}

Naturally, the fund has attracted huge attention in the digital currency world, with more individuals jumping on board, raising more than $150 million worth of\u00a0Ether during its crowdsale.\nEarly Friday morning, however, the DAO was hit by as yet unidentified attackers appearing to take advantage of a\u00a0recursive calling vulnerability, draining millions of Ether into a Child DAO where the hacker(s) will gain control of the funds when it opens after 27 days\u00a0unless\u00a0the Ethereum community adopts\u00a0a proposed soft fork which would prevent the funds from moving. Since the discovery of the hack, the value of Ethereum has dropped dramatically from trading at $21.50\u00a0to $13.35 at its lowest. Only a few days ago, Ethereum was soaring, nearing $20 for the first time.\nOne Ether wallet identified by members of the community as a recipient of the apparent stolen funds currently holds\u00a0more than 3.5 million Ether. At a current exchange of around $14/ETH that brings the total to $47 million; however, at the pre-theft valuation of $21.50/ETH, the amount is significantly more: $79 million.\nGriff Green, a spokesperson for\u00a0Slock.it, said that there is a conversation with the miners to create a soft fork, which would block the Child DAO and the DAO from making any further transactions of any kind.\n\u201cAfter the immediate soft fork, there are discussions about preparing for a hard fork that will, on a certain block in the future create a smart contract that all the ETH in the DAO and the Child DAO will be sent to,\u201d Griff said on the DAO Slack channel. \u201cThis smart contract will allow the holder of any DAO tokens to claim their fair share of ETH.\u201d\nFormer Ethereum CCO and Slock.it founder, Stephan Tual, said on the DAO slack channel:\n\u201cIn summary, a hard fork will retrieve all stolen funds from the attacker. If you have purchased DAO tokens, you will be transferred to a smart contract where you can only retrieve funds. Since no money in the DAO was ever spent, nothing was lost.\u201d\nCommenting about the hack, Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center, said:\n\"DAOs are an important experiment in community governance\u2014governance by code rather than law or norms. Experiments come with risks and rewards and we only learn from the process by letting them run, succeed or fail.\"\n\"It looks like The DAO is failing, but there are some bright spots and the community is already learning critical lessons.\"\n\"For one thing, it's good to see that delays were built into the code so that even though funds are being \"stolen,\" they are stuck in limbo for at least 27 days because of the code that governs the system. That will give the community of users, miners, and developers time to decide what to do. It could mean that we accept the loss, or that changes are made to Ethereum's protocol to return the funds. But those decisions will be made by a decentralized community that votes.\"\n\"This is a laboratory for community governance, and it won't always be pretty. But it's important we let the process play out, and take a longer view of the evolution of these fantastic new tools.\"\n\u00a0\nThe Known Exploit\nInterestingly, five days ago, the DAO posted a blog reportedly stating that the exploit used by the hacker had been fixed. In the\u00a0post, Tual said that the problem had been taken care of:\n\u201cWe issued a fix immediately as part of the DAO Framework 1.1 milestone. The important takeaway from this is: as there is no ether whatsoever in the DAO\u2019s rewards account \u2013 this is NOT an issue that is putting any DAO funds at risk today.\u201d\nIt seems, however, as though the issue to fix the\u00a0DAO Github did not match up with the recommendations in this\u00a0blog post, choosing the non-recommended approach to deal with the issue.\nUnlike other high profile hacks that were reversed in a hard fork, it seems as though the Ethereum community and the DAO holders have a bit of time to consider their options and will need to make a big decision in the next few days.\nShould a hard fork be put into place that will prevent the hacker from gaining around over $50 million, which would be the equivalent of a major heist on a financial institution, or should the DAO and potentially Ethereum simply crash and burn?", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 17}

The project, if successful, could have a major\u00a0impact on how land deals are conducted.\u00a0\nThe Lantm\u00e4teriet, in partnership with Swedish blockchain company ChromaWay\u201a consulting firm Kairos Future and telecommunications company Telia, developed the proof-of-concept of the technology that demonstrates how blockchain technology and smart contracts can make land registration more secure by minimizing the risk associated with manual handling and transferring of land documents or contracts.\u00a0\nAccording to a blog post,\u00a0the proof-of-concept was developed using Telia\u2019s identity verification technology on top of a new smart contract system developed by ChromaWay compatible with both public and private blockchain. Kairos Future, in turn, managed the process and coordinated an accompanying report, while the sponsorship and feedback for the project was provided by the Lantm\u00e4teriet. \u00a0\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, ChromaWay CEO Henrik Hjelte said that by employing digital signatures and doing away with the need for a centralized database to store and maintain land records, smart contracts and blockchain technology can reduce the time it takes it to conduct land deals, at the same time making it more secure.\u00a0\n\u201cBy using digital signatures in all steps in the process of selling a house we can bring down the total time of doing a deal from several months, say three months on average, to less than a day or a few days,\" Hjelte said. \u201cThe use of digital signature will reduce the time even for a centralized database, but a database can easily be subjected to \u2018update\u2019 attacks where history is changed. Blockchain and our smart contracts add a chain of evidence that comes from a history that cannot be changed. There are multiple copies stored by several actors, digital signatures of all steps in the workflow and agreement to the steps in the workflow and who can do what. We think that this adds a great deal of value. Also, our solution makes it impossible to enact certain kinds of fraud that occur now and those are not theoretical frauds. People actually get away with selling properties they don't own.\u201d\nHjelte said that smart contracts can reduce the risk of registering incorrect information and the inability to get title deed and the confirmation from the land registry of ownership of the land. At the same time, the blockchain can regulate and control the workflow, digital signage, correctness of the document and the rules and order of authorization with a unique digital fingerprint.\u00a0\nHjelte, however, clarified that his company\u2019s solution does not, at this stage, mean the \"traditional idea\" \u00a0of putting tokens representing the house \"on\" a blockchain. Rather it is about reforming the workflow of selling a property that integrates with existing systems for keeping track of who owns what. \u00a0\n\"What we are doing is modeling the workflow of selling a house,\u201d Hjelte said. \u201cThe buyers, sellers, land registry, real estate agents all see the same information. Only the parties involved can see the information, and need to see it. A digital identity system is administered by Telia, and digital signatures are used to verify all the steps in selling a house.\u201d\u00a0\nHjelte further adds that besides land registry, their technology can integrate with other vendors and can be applied to other use cases as well.\u00a0\n\"We have some interesting features that allow private information in smart contracts called 'client sign,'\u201d Hjelte said. \"For us, the default is that information is executed by the parties involved in the contract. Then the smart contracts can be integrated with various blockchains that can provide evidence. Ethereum could be one of those blockchains. Bitcoin could be another. For this concept we have used our own private blockchain but one of the good things is you can basically mix and match the features that you want for your particular application.\u201d\u00a0\nAccording to Hjelte, proof-of-concept will be followed up with more project development and testing that will involve real estate agents and banks.

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nThe second-ever Bitcoin block reward halving is estimated to take place in a little under two weeks, and the overall effects of this event are still somewhat of an unknown. There has been a runup in the Bitcoin price over the past month, and many claim this is due to the upcoming halving, where the number of new bitcoins created roughly every 10 minutes is cut in half (from 25 to 12.5).\nTo get some informed opinions about what could happen next, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to BitFury CEO Valery Vavilov and BTCC COO Samson Mow. BitFury manufactures ASIC Bitcoin mining chips (and mines with them), and BTCC controls one of the largest Bitcoin mining pools (in addition to other Bitcoin-related services).\nA Slight Drop in the Network Hashrate\nAlthough Vavilov and Mow were contacted separately, they had similar views on the upcoming Bitcoin halving. One of the most common, possibly-negative effects of the halving discussed in the past has been the idea that the network hashrate will decline as a result of the lower number of bitcoins released to miners on a regular schedule.\nIn terms of this possible issue, Vavilov stated:\n\n\u201cSome decline in the Bitcoin network hashrate is expected, and we believe it will be insignificant. The most important thing is that even if the hashrate declines, it will not compromise the security of the Bitcoin network. As to the Bitcoin price, it surged close to 20 percent over the weekend spanning June 11th and June 12th, and it is a very robust appreciation. This is an indication that the halving event is regarded as a good thing for the Bitcoin industry and it is positively impacting the market even before it takes place.\u201d\n\nMow shared similar comments:\n\n\u201cIt's likely we'll see the overall network hashrate drop slightly after the halving as some smaller miners find it less profitable to continue mining. However the longer-term effects will probably be negligible. Many smaller miners outside of China are mining on the PPLNS model so they are really mining on luck and are not as price sensitive. Within China, nearly all miners are on the PPS model, so their costs and revenues are very stable and predictable. That allows miners in China to optimize their operations for the halving and reduce any potential risk.\u201d\n\nMow also agreed that the halving could continue to have a positive impact on the Bitcoin price. He noted, \u201cThe halving will work to drive up the price, and I believe the upward price movements we've seen lately are the first wave of the upcoming halving-related price increase. Post-halving, we'll see the upward trend continue as fewer coins are being supplied to the market and the halving risk is shown to be a non-issue.\u201d\nAlthough Vavilov and Mow acknowledge the network hashrate may decline slightly, they do not think it will have an overly negative impact on the network.\nThe Halving Spurs Innovation\nIn the case of Vavilov, the BitFury CEO took his views a step further and said the halving has a positive effect on Bitcoin. He believes the upcoming halving will motivate various Bitcoin companies to innovate.\n\u201cThere are many reasons for optimism right now: We see a steady increase of adoption of blockchain technology and [the] Bitcoin Blockchain, in particular,\u201d Vavilov said. \u201cA very positive trend in this regard is a clear scalability roadmap, and Bitcoin protocol improvement efforts that include the segregated witness proposal, Lightning Network, sidechains, and so on. Thanks to the joint efforts by the Bitcoin community, all these technologies are being brought to life, so [the] Bitcoin Blockchain is fully ready to accommodate more users, more transactions and more business. We at The Bitfury Group, in turn, are fully ready for the reward halving.\u201d\nVavilov added, \u201cThose who cannot adapt fast enough will have to switch off. The Bitfury Group is fully prepared for the reward halving.\u201d\nWhat About the Disaster Scenario?\nBoth Mow and Vavilov do not believe the halving will lead to some sort of disaster scenario such as the one described by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong in a Medium post earlier this year. In direct response to some of the concerns laid out by Armstrong in that post, Mow said, \u201cHashrate won\u2019t fall by 50 percent. It\u2019s not possible. Anyone that suggests that hashrate will drop 50 percent is either fearmongering or doesn\u2019t understand mining at all.\u201d\nMow added that Armstrong\u2019s premise is based on the, in his view, false assumption that the Bitcoin price will not increase as a result of the halving.\nMow went on to explain that a lot of new mining hardware has been activated on the Bitcoin network in recent months. \u201cThere is the concept of \u2018sunk cost,\u2019 which might not be factored in by some people when they write down their musings about the halving,\u201d Mow noted. \u201cMost people involved with mining know that a lot of new hashrate was added in the past several months. That's a lot of newer and more efficient hardware that came online which will have a much longer shelf-life. Current estimates are that 60-to-70 percent of the network is composed of newer 16nm ASIC chips.\u201d\n\nTo his point, Bitcoin\u2019s network hashrate has tripled from around 500 PH to roughly 1,500 PH since December of last year.\n\u201cIt would be naive to think that miners who pushed us from [500] PH to 1,500 PH didn\u2019t have projections to recoup costs past halving and decided to invest anyway,\u201d Mow added.\n\u201cAn increase in network hashrate tells us there\u2019s more hardware, but more hardware also means more infrastructure like data centers, transformers, cooling systems and so on,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s expensive. The bulk of that sunk cost has already been incurred so that it can be recouped as much as possible at pre-halving price conditions. Having made those investments in new hardware and facilities, it\u2019s unlikely that those miners will just power off.\u201d\nMow said that many Bitcoin miners are bullish on the price and in it for the long haul, which means they are less concerned with what happens with the price in the short term.\nIn Mow\u2019s view, there\u2019s also nothing inherently wrong with full blocks on the Bitcoin network, which is a crucial aspect of the possible doomsday scenario related to the halving.\nHe stated:\n\n\u201cThe biggest fallacy in [Armstrong\u2019s Medium post] is the part about full blocks. It does not matter if blocks are 70 percent full or if we are at 140 percent of capacity. Bitcoin is designed to function with full blocks \u2013 that is why Bitcoin has fees for transactions. Well-developed wallet software can estimate fees correctly, and in the event there is a backlog of transactions (which Bitcoin was also designed to handle), users simply pay a few cents more to prioritize their transactions if they\u2019re in a hurry.\u201d\n\nMow said that companies in the Bitcoin ecosystem could prop up the network if things started to take a turn for the worse. He mentioned increasing transaction fees, purchasing mining hardware and renting currently available hashing power as three potential options.\nThe Halving Is Not a Surprise\nThis change in monetary policy is not coming out of nowhere, Mow said. The schedule for the creation of new bitcoins has been known since the first blocks were mined in early 2009.\n\u201cMiners have been planning and preparing for the halving for some time now,\u201d he said.\nThe BTCC COO noted that many miners have been optimizing their costs due to the known, expected drop in the Bitcoin-denominated value of the block reward. Due to the recent spike in the Bitcoin price, the U.S. dollar-denominated value of the block reward could be higher than it was around this time last year. As Mow mentioned, the ASIC chips used by most miners these days are also more efficient than the ones used last year.\nThe halving is expected to take place on July 9. According to WinkDex, the Bitcoin price was $269.21 on that day last year, which means each block reward was worth $6,730.25. The Bitcoin price was roughly $635 at the time of this writing. If that price level were to hold, each block would be worth $7,937.50 after the halving.\n\u201cWith the prices as they are now, I wouldn't be too concerned about the miners,\u201d Mow said.", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 27}

Analysis Is Difficult Because Unlike A Conventional Contract, The Terms Are Unclear.\nIt is unclear where an investor in the DAO can go to find the contract terms that bind them, and it is unclear, once they are found, as to whether there is any contract at all. There are terms, rules, regulations, terms, recitals, and warnings about the DAO, found at (1) Daohub.org, (2) the Slock.it GitHub (and its readme.md file), and (3) in the executable code itself (i.e. .sol files) as implemented. Slock.it\u2019s GitHub, its readme.md file and its .sol files were ostensibly authored by Slock.it and whoever applied the latest commit to those files; until recently, it was unclear who was operating Daohub.org. Let\u2019s look at some of the most germane provisions found at these sources:\u2003\nDaohub.org (all excerpts below captured from https://daohub.org/explainer.html)\u00a0\nExplanation of Terms and Disclaimer\nThe terms of The DAO Creation are set forth in the smart contract code existing on the Ethereum blockchain at 0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413. Nothing in this explanation of terms or in any other document or communication may modify or add any additional obligations or guarantees beyond those set forth in The DAO\u2019s code. Any and all explanatory terms or descriptions are merely offered for educational purposes and do not supercede or modify the express terms of The DAO\u2019s code set forth on the blockchain; to the extent you believe there to be any conflict or discrepancy between the descriptions offered here and the functionality of The DAO\u2019s code at 0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413, The DAO\u2019s code controls and sets forth all terms of The DAO Creation.\nDaohub.org\u2019s statements all appear geared toward investors and suggest that its terms (as related to the creation of DAO Tokens) are secondary to that of the code, and references code at a specific Ethereum wallet as prevailing in the event of conflict between the two. This language also suggests that the terms related to the function of the DAO beyond the creation of DAO Tokens are all found at the designated Ethereum wallet. Thus, although the statements found on Daohub.org are written in plain English, there is no guarantee that the code found at the Ethereum wallet address noted, when actually executed, will comply with those disclosures. If there is a contradiction, the code wins.\nThe DAO\u2019s smart contract code governs the Creation of DAO tokens and supercede any public statements about The DAO\u2019s Creation made by third parties or individuals associated with The DAO, past, present and future. The software code currently available at https://github.com/slockit/dao is the sole source for the terms under which DAO tokens may be created.\nDaohub.org\u2019s statement also suggests that the terms are also held at the GitHub address noted therein which is the address for Slock.it\u2019s repository. This conflicts from the statement above that suggests that the code terms (as related to the creation of DAO Tokens) are found at the specific Ethereum wallet address, unless they are identical to the terms found on Daohub.org.\u00a0\nBy Creating DAO tokens through interaction with The DAO\u2019s smart contract code, you expressly agree to all of the terms and conditions set forth in that code. If you do not understand or do not agree to those terms, you should not Create DAO tokens.\nThe use of The DAO\u2019s smart contract code and the Creation of DAO tokens carries significant financial risk, including using experimental software. This document does not constitute a Prospectus of any sort, is not a solicitation for investment and does not pertain in any way to an offering of securities in any jurisdiction.\nHere, DaoHub.org suggests that using the code is risky, and if you do not understand the Code you should not use it, and that the DAO does not \u201cpertain in any way to an offering of securities in any jurisdiction.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nRisks\nThe Creation of DAO tokens carries with it significant risk. Prior to Creating DAO tokens, carefully consider the exemplary and non-exhaustive list of risks set forth below and, to the extent necessary, consult a lawyer, accountant, and/or tax professionals prior to Creating DAO tokens.\n1. Risk of Security Weaknesses in The DAO\u2019s Software\nThe DAO concept is both experimental in nature and unproven. There is a risk that, as an open source project, any contributor to The DAO\u2019s software could introduce weaknesses or bugs into the DAO software, causing the loss of DAO tokens or ETH in one or more or even all of the DAO Token Holder\u2019s accounts.\n2. Risk of Weakness in the DAO underlying blockchain, and/or Ethereum Network\nThe DAO software is itself based on an unproven platform: the Ethereum blockchain. There is a risk that, as an open source project, any contributor to the Ethereum blockchain could introduce weaknesses or bugs into the Ethereum software, causing the loss of DAO tokens or ETH in one or more or even all of the DAO Token Holder\u2019s accounts.\n3. Risk of unforeseen attack vectors\nThe field of Digital Cryptography is very new and for this reason, there is a risk of unforeseen attack both in terms of the underlying cryptographic protocol that back the functioning of the DAO as well as 'game theory' related vectors which have not been documented to date. Both these vectors represent a risk that could lead the loss of DAO tokens or ETH in one or more or even all of the DAO Token Holder\u2019s accounts.\nHere, Daohub.org advises investors that there are risks of bugs or weaknesses in the platform due to coding updates by Slock.it or by Ethereum, or others attacking the system\u2019s behavior.\nDisclaimer of Warranties\nTHE USER EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT THE USER IS CREATING DAO TOKENS AT THE USER\u2019S SOLE RISK AND THAT DAO TOKENS ARE CREATED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EXCEPT ONLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW WITH ANY LEGALLY REQUIRED WARRANTY PERIOD TO THE SHORTER OF THIRTY DAYS FROM FIRST USE OR THE MINIMUM PERIOD REQUIRED).\nWITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, NONE OF THIRD PARTIES OR INDIVIDUALS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DAO CREATION WARRANT THAT THE PROCESS FOR PURCHASING DAO TOKENS WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.\nThe \u201cDisclaimer of Warranties\u201d found on Daohub.org appear to be limited to creating DAO Tokens or \u201cDao Creation\u201d, only. Nothing here appears to apply to Dao operation or project creation/operation.\nLimitations Waiver of Liability\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY ANY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU WILL NOT HOLD THIRD PARTIES OR INDIVIDUALS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DAO CREATION LIABLE FOR ANY AND ALL DAMAGES OR INJURY WHATSOEVER CAUSED BY OR RELATED TO USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, DAO TOKENS OR THE DAO PLATFORM UNDER ANY CAUSE OR ACTION WHATSOEVER OF ANY KIND IN ANY JURISDICTION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ACTIONS FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) AND THAT NONE OF THE THIRD PARTIES OR INDIVIDUALS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DAO CREATION SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL OR DATA, IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, OR CREATION OF, OR INABILITY TO CREATE, DAO TOKENS.\nYOU FURTHER SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE THIRD PARTIES OR INDIVIDUALS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DAO CREATION ARE NOT LIABLE, AND YOU AGREE NOT TO SEEK TO HOLD ANY OF THE THIRD PARTIES OR INDIVIDUALS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DAO CREATION LIABLE, FOR THE CONDUCT OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING OTHER CREATORS OF DAO TOKENS, AND THAT THE RISK OF CREATING AND USING DAO TOKENS RESTS ENTIRELY WITH YOU.\nThe \u201cLimitations Waiver of Liability\u201d suggests that users of the DAO will not hold \u201cthird parties or individuals\u201d associated with the \u201cDao creation\u201d liable for injury \u201ccaused by or related to the use of, or inability to use, Dao Tokens or the Dao Platform,\u201d disclaims responsibility for \u201cthe conduct of third parties, including other creators of DAO Tokens,\u201d and otherwise shifts risk to Investors.\nNow, let\u2019s look at the GitHub readme.md file (found at https://github.com/slockit/DAO/blob/develop/README.md) :\nDisclaimer\nThe future remains a work in progress. Our vision exists in a world where laws vary widely. It is important to remember that anyone who uses the generic DAO framework for The DAO or any other DAO will do so at their own risk. One can only speculate about the legal status of DAOs worldwide. Whatever one\u2019s personal beliefs may be, people must draw their own conclusions, relying on legal advice where appropriate. The authors are not a law firm and are not in the business of offering legal advice.\nIf you create a DAO it will be your DAO, and you will be responsible for its operation.\nHere, the readme.md attempts to shift risk from Slock.it to the Investor and the implementer of the code. In this case, however, Slock.it is the implementer of the code.\u00a0\nNote: Although the word \"contract\" is used in The DAO\u2019s code, the term is a programming convention and is not being used as a legal term of art. The term is a programming convention, not a representation that the code is in and of itself a legally binding and enforceable contract. If you have questions about legal enforceability, consult with legal counsel.\nHere, the readme.md disclaims creating any legal and binding enforceable contract and urges participants to consult with legal counsel.\nThe DAO is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU lesser General Public License for more details.\nHere, the readme.md file disclaims any warranties, and refers to the GNU General Public License.\u00a0\nAdditional Disclaimers\nNEITHER THE SOFTWARE NOR ITS CREATORS PROVIDE LEGAL ADVICE AND THIS CODE WAS NOT CREATED TO PROVIDE LEGAL ADVICE OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. BY USING THIS CODE YOU ALSO AGREE:\na. The creators of the Software and its contributors are not your lawyers.\nb. The Software is not a lawyer.\nc.

You agree that in order for you to form a legally binding contract that you shall seek legal advice from an appropriately qualified and experienced lawyer within your jurisdiction.\nh. Issuance of DAO tokens may constitute the sale of securities in certain jurisdictions. Seek appropriate legal advice before deploying DAO code.\nThrough this language, Slock.it disclaims the creation of a legally binding contract in any jurisdiction, instructs users to seek legal advice from a lawyer, and urges caution that its code may create securities (which seems to contradict what was noted on daohub.org).\nNow, let\u2019s look at the actual code files: Dao.sol (same found in DaoTokenCreationProxyTransfer.sol, DTHPool.sol, ManagedAccount.sol etc.) which contains the following comment:\nIn the comments to the code itself, warranties are expressly disclaimed, and further reference is made to the GNU license. This suggests that the GNU license\u2019s terms are integrated into the terms of the DAO as well.\nSo, are any of these terms enforceable against investors? Maybe. It is possible to invest in TheDao without reviewing any of the marketing materials on Daohub.org, on Slock.it\u2019s Github, or the applicable code; thus, it is unclear whether each investor is aware of any of the disclaimers on any of these sources. Assuming that Investors have actually reviewed these sources, the disclaimer of entry into contract may preclude any of these terms from being enforceable at all- otherwise they could be viewed as illusory for lack of consideration flowing back to the Investor. Alternatively, the Investor may be imputed to awareness of the terms when contributing ETH to the DAO, whether or not any contract is or is not formed.\u00a0 A Court could also impute that a contract exists despite the language stating otherwise. The provisions that attempt to impose a waiver against claims brought against third parties may be weakest, as it is not clear which activities are actually protected, and who may claim to be an intended beneficiary of those provisions, and thus, a third party (perhaps the Ethereum Foundation) may have difficulty if claiming to be a beneficiary of the waiver under that provision.\u00a0\nThe terms and disclosures above, however, do not reflect the activity of the system- which is only discernable by a review of the execution of the code itself. Thus, an Investor would have to be able to read and understand the functionality of the code to understand what the code will do, and then determine the risks of investment based upon their own analysis. While it may seem far-fetched, generally speaking, to expect every Investor to read and understand the code, parties to contracts are generally imputed to have understood their terms upon entry, except in cases like contracts of adhesion (i.e. agreements which may be voided because one party has unequal bargaining power, and the terms are unconscionably unfair). However, the fact that the DAO readme.md file and Daohub.org terms roundly disclaim any formation of any contract suggests that there may be more ambiguity in the construction of these terms than expected.\u00a0\n2. Suing on Behalf Of, or Against The DAO is Challenging Because of a Likely Lack of\u00a0 Standing\nA lawsuit naming a DAO as a Defendant would likely stall immediately because of the difficulty of identifying a representative of the DAO with standing to represent it. The party served with process as a representative of a DAO (or the DAO) would likely move to quash service on the basis that they do not legally \u201crepresent\u201d the DAO. The Court would then determine whether the person who was served appropriately represents the DAO for legal purposes. To make this determination, the Court would attempt to classify the DAO legally, and then, by analogy, determine who within that DAOs structure appropriately represents it. In certain jurisdictions, entities may not represent themselves pro se, and must be represented in litigation by a lawyer. This could, illogically, lead to claims for intervention by others (perhaps investors) who claim that the person designated to act for the DAO is acting without authority and perhaps to seek declaration that the lawyer is not authorized to act for the DAO because no person is authorized to subject the DAO to the jurisdiction of the court. To avoid this, a DAO may choose to designate an owner, manager, or legal representative. A DAO may choose to not designate a human representative to avoid regulatory interaction or potential liability. However, a lack of representative capacity will complicate any legal claims asserted, as it is unclear whether the various human actors affecting the DAO\u2019s conduct (i.e. Creators, Investors, Curators, or Contractors in the case of the DAO) or the DAO itself, may actually represent the DAO. (If the DAO itself is recognized as a legally independent actor, its representative may be sued repeatedly, and those plaintiffs may attempt to hold that person personally liable.) Thus an analysis of DAO\u2019s structure will likely be required.\nDAOs may be analogized, based on their structure and function, to other legally recognized entities, but their lack of incorporation will preclude DAOs from exercising rights typically granted to incorporated entities. Incorporated entities are independent legal actors, and in most situations, claims related to the activity of the entity are brought against or on behalf of the entity, not its individual operators/investors/members. Business entities exist as individual actors with independent legal existence based upon the legal grant of power by governments. This grant of power created by force of law permits entities to exercise legal powers (for example, the power to enter contract on its behalf), and to shield individuals from individual liability for the actions of the entity. However, because DAOs are not typically incorporated, the traditional corporate shield protecting registered entities will likely not apply to protect the individuals acting under the DAO structure. Thus, a DAO will probably be considered an unincorporated association, or a general partnership. Although the analysis is nuanced, if a DAO is considered a general partnership, any partner (who those would be remains unclear) could represent the DAO and be sued and held fully liable for its debts. If it\u2019s considered an \u201cunincorporated association,\u201d the analysis is more complex, but a participating member may be a representative of the association provided that a level of control over the association is established.\u00a0\nThe next question is one of geography- has the DAO submitted to the personal jurisdiction of your court? Because DAOs use pseudo-anonymous blockchains, identifying persons involved may be extremely difficult. Disclosures in the code of the DAO, or in the technical specifications of a Project Proposal may help identify creators of a DAO. (Slock.it is based out of Germany.) However, it may be extremely expensive and difficult to obtain jurisdiction over any person who represents a DAO where the injured plaintiff resides. Thus, litigants may be required to bring actions in multiple jurisdictions to obtain relief, and litigation against a DAO may be an economically impractical exercise.\u00a0 Based upon the potential lack of domestic representatives appropriate for service, and the general difficulty of identifying participants, prospective plaintiffs may not be able to identify persons who can be served on behalf of a DAO.\n3. Who May Have Claims Against Whom?\u00a0\nHypothetically, claims may be brought against the creators of the DAO for misrepresentations asserted to induce investment (i.e. related to marketing disclosures), improper design, function, and/or coding of the DAO itself (where behaviors of the DAO do not occur as expected because of technical errors or undisclosed/clandestine behaviors), or torts committed by the creators against the DAO (such as theft of assets through otherwise undisclosed intrusion vectors). In this case, the question of whether a contract exists or not is critical. If there is no contract, then the provision of ETH in exchange for DAO Tokens could be considered a bailment (i.e. the creators are holding ETH) and the loss of those ETH (to the extent that they are not available for a split) could be considered the breach of a bailment relationship, entitling the investor to damages. Likewise, in the case of faulty design, negligence claims seem likely.\nLikewise, it is possible that claims may be brought against a Contractor who promotes a Proposal to a DAO, if the Contractor makes misrepresentations as to the attributes, functionality, or expectation of repayment related to a Proposal, or if a Proposal fails to fulfill its repayment obligation to the DAO, whether intentionally (i.e. by fraud, or by absconding with the funds), mistakenly (as a result of a hack), or negligently (because of an internal coding error, or data breach). It is unclear whether investors would be determined to have contractual privity with a Project Contractor (who must be another investor), as it is unclear if any parties to the DAO have any privity with any other party based on the disclaimers provided with its marketing materials. If the proposal run that causes a loss event is a split (i.e. is not voted upon by the investors) then it is possible that, depending on the circumstances, there may be a claim for theft and the civil claim of conversion. However, the ETH held by the DAO is no longer held by the investors, so they could probably only bring such a claim as derivative on behalf of the DAO.\nCurators may have liability for \u201cwhitelisting\u201d a Proposal that fails or does not behave as represented. Curators may also have joint liability with Contractors for a Proposal coding error that results in harm to the Investors. Curators may likewise have liability for dishonest behavior intended to benefit themselves, or some participants in a DAO at the expense of others. If there is no contractual relationship, a curator who whitelisted a malicious proposal may have liability for aiding and abetting or conspiring with a proposal contractor who causes injury to investors, although as noted above, the underlying claim for the conspiracy or aiding and abetting liability may not be clear.\nInvestors potentially could bring claims against other Investors, either individually, or derivatively on behalf of the DAO, or as a class (except that proceeding as a class was purportedly waived in Daohub.org\u2019s terms), for acts that subject the investment base of a DAO to risk, including for any improper voting behavior, for conspiring with Curators to promote their own self-interest, or due to \u201cmanagement decisions\u201d made by sub-classes of Investors with disproportionate voting power. Here, the Exploiter is an Investor who offered a split which resulted in the investment base of the DAO to be siphoned off into a child DAO under the Exploiter\u2019s exclusive control.\u00a0\nLet\u2019s look at some specific legal theories that may provide relief against the Exploiter:\nA. Theft/conversion\u00a0\nA claim for theft would allege that the Exploiter took what did not belong to him/her/them or took something without authority to do so, and that doing so damaged someone else. The Exploiter, according to the governance schema, should not have been able to take more than their own ETH into their own child DAO. However, by exploiting a bug, the Exploiter was able to do just that. Thus, a conversion claim may be available, provided that the court determines that the Exploiter was bound to the governance schema. The civil claim, for conversion, requires a plaintiff to have ownership rights, the defendant to have intentionally interfered with those rights /exercised domain and control of those rights, deprived the plaintiff of possession and use, and cased damage. Thus, an Investor alleging theft would have to show some basis to assert that he or she has ownership rights in the holdings of the DAO. This contention is unclear; the ability to split and recover invested ETH suggests a contingent claim on some of the DAO\u2019s assets.\nAn investor individually could show standing by failing to get 1.0ETH per 100 DAO Tokens after a split (which takes about 2 months), and sue for the difference between what they expected to get out versus what was left to take out via split. Alternatively, an investor could attempt to represent the DAO derivatively for this claim, claiming that the DAO itself was injured. (Note that Investors purportedly waive class action according to Daohub.org) As noted above, standing on behalf of the DAO is difficult to determine in the absence of a designated representative. \u00a0\nB. Breach of Bailment Claim\nAs the marketing materials and code suggest that no legal contract exists, an alternative interpretation would be that the DAO created a bailment relationship- wherein the DAO held ETH for Investors, and that it failed to hold them. (This is the same claim you might bring if the valet who parked your car instead lost your car). This claim could be brought by an Investor against the DAO, which, again, may be impossible to serve.\u00a0\nC. Tortious Interference Claim.\nInvestors could attempt to individually sue the Exploiter for tortious interference with business relationships. To allege tortious interference a party must show a valid contract or economic expectancy between the plaintiff and a 3rd person, knowledge of the contract or expectancy by the defendant, intent by defendant to interference with the contract, actual interference, lack of justification, privilege or excuse (i.e. was improper to interfere), resulting in damage. An investor may show a business relationship with the DAO (which, depending on jurisdiction may or may not require a contract), knowledge of the investor\u2019s relationship to the DAO (maybe, because the existence of token holders is public knowledge, but any individual investor\u2019s participation is not necessarily public), intent and actual interference are likely established (by taking ETH which would have existed for investment or for withdrawal via split). This leaves lack of justification, privilege or excuse and actual damage. These elements may be tricky, as the Exploiter may use the fact that it was a bug and not a hack to establish justification, privilege or excuse. The exploiter may also contest if there are actual money damages. However, the drop in market value of DAO Tokens and ETH, along with the reduction in the DAO\u2019s investment funds may suffice.\nD. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\u00a0\nPursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a71030(a)(4) \u201cWhoever \u2026 knowingly and with intent to defraud, accesses a protected computer without authorization, or exceeds authorized access and by means of such conduct furthers the intended fraud and obtains anything of value, unless the object of the fraud and the thing obtained consists only of the use of the computer and the value of such use is not more than $5,000 in any 1-year period.\u201d Although this claim sounds simple, the interpretation and implementation is complex and quickly evolving. The threshold question is whether the Exploiter \u201cexceeds authorized access.\u201d An argument may be offered that the Exploiter exceeded his/her/their authorized access by taking funds that were not rightfully theirs. Again, this claim would be brought by the DAO.\u00a0\nContract-based claims like breach of contract, violation of good faith and fair dealing and even quantum meruit (and its equitable cousin, unjust enrichment) may fail as a result of the express disclaimer of contract formation found in the marketing materials related to the DAO. If a court imputes a contract, any number of contract-based claims, including breach of contract, or breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, may be available as well. However, proper waivers are generally legally enforceable; thus, a claimant Investor is probably resigned to seeking equitable, tort, statutory, and/or other non-contract based claims.\n4. Ethereum Foundation\u2019s Potential Responses\nThe Ethereum Foundation was alerted to the exploit at about 3:09am EST on Friday. The log of the chat opened by Foundation members (many of whom are also curators of and apparently heavily invested in the DAO) is riveting and shows that a multitude of approaches were discussed early on, including hard fork, soft fork, and a roll back. Within 30 minutes of the discovery of the exploit, the Ethereum Foundation caused exchanges to suspend Ethereum withdrawals and trading. The chat log includes discussion of coping mechanisms aimed at preventing a crash in the value of ETH. Both of the below discussed fork-based solutions are notable in that they are not to be implemented by the DAO, but contemplate Ethereum itself modifying its blockchain to fix the DAO\u2019s exploit. Of course, while the Ethereum Foundation can propose whatever software modification it wants, but unless the majority of miners adopt the new code, none of the proposed Ethereum-driven solutions will go into effect.\na. Hard fork:\nThe proposed hard fork would move all stolen ETH funds into a new wallet which would be used to refund investors in the DAO and shut down the DAO. Slock.it has already advocated for the hard fork solution. Others have argued that the hard fork undermines the credibility of the Ethereum platform, creates legal risk for developers, (and potentially excuses for third parties such as law enforcement to intervene) and rewards participants in an experiment who should have understood their risk.\nb. Soft fork:\nThe proposed soft fork would create code that would permit miners to selectively invalidate transactions, and intends for those miners to invalidate transactions made using the ETH taken by the Exploiter. This approach would permit DAO Token transfers to continue and permit the Dao functions that do not touch ETH to continue. (So much for fungibility.) This would permit miners to lock the stolen ETH and the DAO\u2019s ETH. Advocates of this approach suggest that the soft fork would be less damaging because it would be reversible and buys time for more elegant solutions to be devised. Detractors point out the same centralization arguments as above. The soft fork may introduce further havoc by providing miners with discretion as to what transactions they may block. Despite the risks, the soft fork approach appears to be favored.\nc. Problems with either forking option:\nIs the DAO too big to fail, and should it be bailed out? That\u2019s the real question being considered here. Although the motivations behind forking appear compassionate and directed at stabilizing Ethereum and the DAO, these solutions may ultimately destabilize Ethereum and the DAO. As argued by Pelle Braendgaard, neither Ethereum nor the DAO are incorporated like conventional entities, but they substitute the legally-bestowed corporate veil that shields an entity\u2019s underlying actors from liability with the veil of decentralization.\u00a0 Provided that the system is executed via decentralized actors, creators are not liable. However, if a hard or soft fork is implemented to correct the exploit, by violating the decentralization the creators and those who maintain these platforms may be subjecting themselves to arguments that they have taken or the ability to take, control at any time, which may result in personal liability. Of course, any proposed fork must be ratified by miner adoption, but even consideration of a fork of any kind to resolve what is at its core a flaw of the DAO, and not the Ethereum blockchain, is troubling. Although Slock.it may have potential liability for the exploit, by forking, the Ethereum Foundation may be taking on potential liability.\nBraendgaard\u2019s point is well taken. If Ethereum intervenes to roll back transactions or sequester funds, the claim of decentralization or immutability is shown to be illusory. This may even invite claims by the Exploiter against the Ethereum Foundation for taking away the ETH obtained by the exploit. (It is understood that many Ethereum Foundation members are heavily invested in the DAO.) A fork would be viewed as a \u201cbank bail-out,\u201d potentially self-serving, and those with the power to do so may be looked at as responsible.\nd. Counterattack\nThe DAO creators, Slock.it, suggested a counter-attack, seeking to take advantage of the same exploit, to prevent the child Dao from seizing the Eth as a solution to the exploit. This suggestion itself validates the approach of the Exploiter as legitimate system functionality. As noted by P Gun Sirer, it is also a very risky approach. However, it may be favorable compared to the hard and soft forks noted above.\u00a0\ne. Bitcoin\u2019s Mt. Gox Approach:\nBitcoin had a mass loss event in the well-publicized Mt. Gox disaster. As a result of Mt. Gox, bitcoin users were unable to control their bitcoin and functionally lost hundreds of millions of dollars of value. In the wake of Mt. Gox, bitcoin valuation against USD plummeted, the platform was pilloried in the media, and many predicted its doom. Yet, there was no split, or roll back or freezing of assets to try to reclaim bitcoin for those affected. Today, Bitcoin continues to exist as a decentralized immutable platform, and is at a total market cap approaching its all-time high. Perhaps the Ethereum community should look at Mt. Gox before endangering its platform with knee jerk reactions for the benefit of a subset of the Ethereum users who risked participation in the DAO.\nAlthough many investors holding DAO Tokens may be frustrated with the exploit, and rightfully bemoan their loss of millions of dollars, the overcorrection of forking to reclaim those ETH may be more disastrous long term than permitting the exploit to persist. The exploit is a problem for the DAO, not for Ethereum, unless Ethereum is more concerned with the trade value of its ETH than it is with the integrity of the transactions occurring on its blockchain. A fork invites the slippery slope argument \u2013 when in the future will the fork reverse my latest transaction, and for what reason, and under what circumstances?\u00a0 Will future smart contract failures all call for corrective forks as well? The exploit\u2019s only impact on Ethereum was to cause the value of Ethereum against the USD to drop. Thus, a fork smacks of arbitrary rulemaking and control group self-interest, and has been predicted to have a negative effect on the viability of ETH as an economic asset. A fork that permits Investors to reclaim their ETH but crushes the value of ETH by impairing the viability of the platform long-term may cause more damage than the loss caused by the the DAO exploit.\n5. Exploiter\u2019s Potential Claim Against the Ethereum Foundation\nThe Exploiter, having taken advantage of a system coding error as opposed to having actively hacked the DAO (although better minds than mine may draw the line between the two, I will not) may actually have a claim against the Ethereum Foundation if they offer a hard or soft fork to Ethereum miners that functionally freezes the ETH to be supplied to the child DAO or reverses any transfer of ETH to the Exploiter. The Exploiter, claiming to have not violated any laws, may actually seek to enjoin the Ethereum Foundation from taking any action to restrict his/her/their use of the ETH in the child DAO created by the exploit. The Exploiter could also claim tortious interference with his/her/their rights to the child DAO they created using the DAO according to the \u201cterms\u201d of its code. Although these claims would require the Exploiter to identify themselves, there is an argument to be made that the Ethereum Foundation itself may be liable for taking away assets obtained by the Exploiter through the permitted use of the DAO. However, if the ETH are deemed stolen, then the Exploiter cannot show legal title or a viable claim to the funds, and these claims would fail.\u00a0\nConclusion\nThe law is unprepared for the DAO and the DAO is unprepared for the law. The disclosures, terms and legal warnings are inconsistent and confused.\u00a0 Although it mimics the structure and behavior of a registered business entity, because it avoids compliance with registration requirements by operating as a distributed software platform lacking executives, directors, legal jurisdiction of incorporation or physical location it will likely not be provided with the same legal recognition, or be provided the rights and privileges typically provided to registered entities. Thus, in the instance of a lawsuit, a court will be forced to grapple with the implications of a web of contracts and computer code imitating an entity, but without the infrastructure created by statutes, and centuries of common law precedent and civil law interpretation that guide courts when considering claims regarding incorporated entities. Because of the lack of recognized legal form, the DAO and other unregistered DAOs will create significant impediments to involved parties seeking to obtain dispute resolution related to their activities involving DAOs from courts, which suggests that specialized proprietary alternate dispute resolution (\u201cADR\u201d) provisions may be necessary. The disposition or determination of claims alleged by Investors against the DAO, against the Creators of the DAO, or against the Exploiter who took ETH via bug exploit remain uncertain. However, the exploit will likely be considered a type of theft, and investors, if they can establish standing to act for the DAO, may have a variety of claims.\u00a0\nImportant Disclaimer: NOTHING HEREIN IS INTENDED TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS LEGAL ADVICE.\u00a0CONSULT A LAWYER QUALIFIED TO PROVIDE LEGAL ADVICE IN YOUR JURISDICTION", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 21}

The company has announced that it raised $60 million in a new Series D funding round led by Beijing-based investment firm IDG Capital, an existing Circle investor. The company also announced the opening of its Chinese subsidiary Circle China, which had been separately funded earlier.\nParticipants in the new Circle funding round include global venture capital and private equity firm, Breyer Capital, General Catalyst Partners and a group of Chinese firms including; Baidu, China International Capital Corporation ALPHA, China Everbright Limited, Wanxiang and CreditEase. Individual investors include Sam Palmisano, former CEO and chairman of IBM, and Glenn Hutchins, co-founder of private equity firm Silver Lake.\nCircle now has a solid network of partners in the region, notably including technology giant Baidu.\n\u201cCircle is one of the most impressive startups in the blockchain technology space,\u201d said Peter Fang, executive director of Baidu corporate development. \u201cTogether with other influential investors, Baidu is very excited to partner with Circle team to build its vision successfully and globally.\"\nCircle co-founders Sean Neville and Jeremy Allaire noted that the company is building a global payments network that will soon enable users in the U.S., Europe and China to exchange value seamlessly and nearly instantly.\n\u201cToday we announced two related milestones: a $60 million strategic financing from a syndicate of major Chinese strategic investors; and the formation of Circle China, a new Beijing-based company focused on bringing the benefit of open, global, blockchain-powered social payments to Chinese consumers,\u201d said Neville and Allaire. \u201cWe want to connect consumers using dollars, pounds, euro and renminbi the same way that the web, email and other protocols have connected consumers globally.\u201d\nCircle China was formed six months ago as an independent Chinese company focused on bringing the benefits of open, global social payments to Chinese consumers, with a multi-million-dollar seed investment from many of the strategic investors in the new Series D round. Circle emphasizes its commitment to developing a China-native company with major Chinese owners and investors in both Circle China and Circle Global and being fully compliant with the laws and regulations of the Chinese payments and banking regime.\n\"We're not aiming to compete with the domestic market as that would be a suicide mission given the strength of local players like Alipay and WeChat but we can connect Chinese consumers with the euro zone and dollar markets,\" Allaire told Reuters, adding that Circle China has not yet launched a product, pending a deal with a local banking partner and a legal license to operate.\u00a0\n\u201cIDG is very bold on Circle\u2019s vision of blockchain and social payment,\u201d said Hugo Shong, founding general partner of IDG Capital. \u201cJust like the success of Alipay and WeChat pay here in China, we have full confidence in Circle team building global products which will be enjoyed by hundreds of millions of people daily.\u201d\u00a0\nAccording to Circle\u2019s founders, Chinese consumers will play a much bigger role in the global economy in the coming years. Therefore the renminbi will become a much more important currency in the world. Neville and Allaire mentioned remittances sent home by Chinese students and young professionals abroad as an important application of Circle\u2019s services.\nIn April, Bitcoin Magazine\u00a0reported that Circle was granted an e-money license by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and started offering British Circle users the ability to hold GBP and make GBP payments instantly with zero fees. Now the company is announcing that it is opening Circle Euro support to consumers in Spain as the first part of a broader European-wide rollout to occur over the coming month, once some remaining regulatory obstacles have been cleared.\n\u201c\u2018Lighting up Euro\u2019 on Circle\u2019s platform is critical in our effort to enable consumers everywhere to share value and is also important to our efforts in China,\u201d noted Neville and Allaire, adding that the company is on track to exceed a billion dollars in transaction volume on an annual basis and the global customer base has grown by 300 percent over the past 12 months.\nForbes\u00a0notes that Circle currently uses the Bitcoin blockchain, as opposed to alternative or private blockchains, to settle payments. In fact, in November Allaire wrote a thoughtful analysis of the blockchain vs. bitcoin issue and explained the advantages of the Bitcoin blockchain over alternative implementations. However, Allaire noted that Circle is open to using any public blockchain as long as it has good software support, distribution among merchants and consumers, a global liquid market and enough scale to be secure, as reported by Forbes.", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 28}

But every analysis includes the current situation in China where an uncertain economy and yuan devaluation seems to be causing a marked increase in Bitcoin trading volume.\nBobby Lee, CEO of China\u2019s BTCC exchange, sees this as the natural progression of a very good idea whose time has come. Lee told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n\u201cThe recent price rise could be because people are finally catching up to the fact that Bitcoin is truly a suitable global asset class. More and more people are buying into this argument. If you look back at the last eight years, Bitcoin has essentially gone up several times each year.\u201d\n\nA strong believer in the intrinsic value of Bitcoin, Lee is not overly excited about the current price surge, but sees it as a continuation of a long-term trend:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic about Bitcoin as a digital asset. For Bitcoin to gain widespread adoption in the next 20 years, it has to be valued at much more than the $10 billion that it currently is in terms of circulation value. I believe that Bitcoin will be successful globally in the next 20 years, meaning that it will be multiples and multiples of where it stands today.\u201d\u00a0\n\nChina\u2019s Capital Controls Not a Factor in Rising Bitcoin Price\nLee has noted previously that the yuan devaluation has had an impact on the Bitcoin market. He told Bitcoin Magazine\u00a0in a May article:\n\n\"BTCC has seen very high trading volumes this past weekend. In fact, on our Pro Exchange, we saw record volumes on Friday, the highest ever since our launch last October. This recent rally was indeed led by the China market, which gives credit to the theory that people were predicting today's yuan devaluation.\"\n\nHowever, Lee is adamant that the Chinese government\u2019s capital controls are not a factor.\nIn a speech to a Stanford University audience recently, Lee reiterated that capital controls have no effect on the price of Bitcoin. He noted that investors are buying up bitcoins but aren\u2019t necessarily sending their bitcoins out of the country and, in any case, \u201cthere are lots of ways around the current capital controls.\u201d\nScaling Debate Not a Significant Factor\u00a0\nLee acknowledges that the scaling debate has used up lots of oxygen in the space recently, but he believes it is not as serious as some would have us believe:\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe scaling debate has been over-reported. I think the two sides were too public in their debates and fights. The recent two months have been better in that there\u2019s been less public arguments and exchange of insults. I think the community should let the developers go and figure out a solution. I think everyone wants to scale Bitcoin; there\u2019s no question about that. It\u2019s just a matter of which solution makes sense.\u201d\n\nChinese Government and PBOC Allowing Innovation to Flourish\nLee sees a government and central bank that are willing to give Bitcoin some breathing room \u2012 limiting restrictions as much as possible.\nLee told the Stanford University audience that he believes the Chinese people have a special view of the future and see the coming globalization as a natural historical progression.\n\n\u201cSo, most likely, the PBOC [People\u2019s Bank of China] will not develop a digital currency that is both decentralized and limited in issuance, and I don\u2019t see any threats to Bitcoin from central banks. However, I do think that it is great that the PBOC is looking into the technology behind Bitcoin. I think all central banks should look into this technology, and look into adopting existing digital currencies like Bitcoin as part of their basket of reserve currencies.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI believe that Bitcoin will remain the most valuable digital asset of choice.\u201d\nAsked about his view of Ether and other competing altcoins, Lee said:\n\n\u201cThe world has room for lots of digital currencies. I think there are probably four or five mainstream digital currencies. There are also 700 or up to a thousand total digital currencies in circulation. Many of them are not well known. In any case, I believe that Bitcoin will remain the most valuable digital asset of choice.\n\nHowever, different digital currencies can have different uses. Ether is used in smart contracts and so on. There\u2019s Dogecoin, Litecoin, Ripple and many other decentralized digital currencies. They all have their uses, but in the end I think one currency will dominate in terms of market value, and for now and, I believe for the foreseeable future, that currency will be Bitcoin.\u201d\nUpcoming Halving a Factor in Price Surge\nIn recognition of BTCC\u2019s fifth anniversary and to get ahead of the July halving, the exchange recently released its Five Bitcoin V Series. The Five Bitcoin coin is made of titanium and has already sold out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of bitcoins, and I think that physical bitcoins are a great way to promote the value of Bitcoin and digital currency because they\u2019re something that people can hold and touch and see. Physical bitcoins allow people to see with their own eyes how a string of numbers can have value attached to them. This is revolutionary, and is a great conversation starter to get people talking about Bitcoin.\u201d\n\u201cThe upcoming block halving was indeed one of the timing considerations for the release of these physical bitcoins. We wanted to issue our first series of physical bitcoins before the block halving so that people get access to the new coins that are still part of the 25 BTC block.\u201d\u00a0\n\nLee is confident that Bitcoin will survive and prosper into the future:\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working hard to realize our vision of a world in which everyone uses Bitcoin. Our company mission is to give the world the most convenient and trustworthy digital currency services. So we will not rest until we ensure that everyone uses Bitcoin and other digital currencies, and BTCC is the premier provider of Bitcoin and digital currency services.\u201d\u00a0\n", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 24}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin right now is\u00a0not really anonymous. While Bitcoin addresses aren't necessarily linked to real-world identities, they can be. Monitoring the unencrypted peer-to-peer network, analysis of the public blockchain and know your customer (KYC) policy or anti-money laundering (AML) regulation can reveal a lot about who's using Bitcoin and for what.\nThis is not ideal from a privacy perspective. To show some examples; Bitcoin users might not want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own, while businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors.\nAdditionally, bitcoins being traceable, possibly \u201ctainted\u201d and potentially worth less than other bitcoins is at odds with\u00a0fungibility. This could even challenge Bitcoin's value proposition as money.\nOne solution to increase privacy and protect fungibility is to exchange bitcoins for fiat currency without being required to identify yourself.\nThe Problem\nExchanges, brokerages, money transmitters and other service providers that serve as the \u201con-ramps\u201d and \u201coff-ramps\u201d between bitcoin and fiat currency, form an important part of the Bitcoin ecosystem. But from a privacy and fungibility perspective, a heavy reliance on these companies is not ideal: Practically all fiat-facing bitcoin-companies are required to apply AML/KYC-checks on their customers.\nMoreover, these checks can be (and are sometimes) combined with wider blockchain-analysis, pertaining to the past trail of bitcoins, to in some cases even monitor where bitcoins move to after leaving these services. This allows for extensive mapping of the Bitcoin ecosystem. (In a recent blog post, R3CEV Director of Market Research Tim Swanson even described this as a \u201cde facto Kimberley Process\u201d.)\nThere are some ways to avoid these kinds of checks. Most obviously, users can exchange bitcoins for fiat outside of any exchange, for example, at Bitcoin meetups. But it becomes a bit more tricky online: Users need to trust their counterparty or maybe a dedicated middleman to actually send the bitcoins or wire the fiat currency. Alternatively, converting bitcoins to fiat currency can be done by purchasing Bitcoin debit cards such as\u00a0Cryptopay or\u00a0BitPlastic. Converting fiat currency to bitcoins, vouchers such as the\u00a0Bitupcard may also offer a solution.\nMost of these options, however, are rather expensive, clunky or both.\nLocal Exchange\nA perhaps more sophisticated solution is the use of exchanges that don't require identity-checks; there are several.\nThe earliest of such alternatives is the Finland-based exchange\u00a0LocalBitcoins, launched in 2012. As opposed to typical exchanges, LocalBitcoins is a platform that does not touch fiat currency itself. Instead, users send the fiat through typical wire transfers or other methods. And, as the name of the website suggests, users can also meet up locally and trade bitcoins for cash on the spot. This allows LocalBitcoins to be more lenient when it comes to AML/KYC-policies \u2013 although some sellers do require their counterparty to identify themselves through the LocalBitcoins-platform to some degree. (In the United States, some LocalBitcoins.com sellers have been charged under anti-money laundering laws.)\nBuilding on this concept in 2014, the\u00a0Mycelium mobile Bitcoin wallet introduced\u00a0Local Trader: a Bitcoin exchange built right into the wallet. Mycelium users who want to buy or sell bitcoins for cash can make an offer on the Mycelium platform where they indicate a price and maximum distance they\u2019re willing to travel. Once a match is made with another trader, they can meet up and complete the trade locally, typically with cash. The Bitcoin side of the trade is taken care of in-app, which also includes a reputation system.\nDecentralized Exchange\nHowever, even if the fiat side of the trade is handled locally, LocalBitcoins and Mycelium types of solutions still rely on a central intermediary to some extent: LocalBitcoins and Mycelium. And in the end, these companies can be required to apply AML/KYC-types of regulation as well - or be shut down entirely. (LocalBitcoins had to cease its operations in Germany back in 2014.) An interesting alternative, therefore, is fully decentralized exchanges that rely on no central intermediary to process fiat or Bitcoin transactions.\nA first attempt at establishing a decentralized exchange was\u00a0Coinffeine, launched in late 2013. Coinfeinne partly solved the counterparty risk \u2013 the risk of a trading partner not paying up \u2013 through a combination of security deposits and an incremental trading protocol. In short, both parties in a trade, deposit a specific amount of bitcoins into a two-of-two multi-address, requiring a signature from each to unlock. Subsequently, the trading partners trade in incremental amounts: no single trade is bigger than the security deposit. As such, neither trader has an incentive not to pay their part: they would lose their security deposit worth the same amount if they did.\nCoinfeinne is a novel idea, but it doesn't hold up as nicely in practice. The security deposits leave room for certain types of fraud or extortion. A victim might, for instance, prefer to get half of his deposit back rather than nothing at all. Additionally, trading in incremental amounts is not exactly user-friendly nor fast, especially if it takes a wire transfer to complete each time.\nMore recently, the decentralized Bitcoin exchange\u00a0Bitsquare launched. Bitsquare\u00a0solved the counterparty problem with dedicated arbiters, as well as \u2013 again \u2013 security deposits. These deposits are locked up along with the traded bitcoins in a two-of-three multisig address where the third key is held by a dedicated and mutually agreed upon arbiter. As such, the buyer is incentivized to send the fiat currency; he'll lose his deposit otherwise. And once he receives the fiat curremcy, the seller is incentivized to release the bitcoins for the same reason. If either attempts to cheat, the arbitrator helps the victim get his bitcoins.\u00a0\nTo prevent bank-chargeback fraud, Bitsquare limits trades to a maximum between .75 and 1.5 each, for now.", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 28}

Recently R3 commissioned Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin to write a report on Ethereum design, upcoming technical developments and applications in private systems. Buterin\u2019s report, titled \u201cEthereum: Platform Review - Opportunities and Challenges for Private and Consortium Blockchains,\u201d is online on R3\u2019s website.\nButerin\u2019s 44-page report gives a detailed overview of Ethereum\u2019s overall architecture and technical design, current status and development roadmap. Ethereum 2.0 is expected in late 2017 and Ethereum 3.0 in late 2018. These labels don\u2019t have much information attached, but indicate that the developers are pushing ahead at full speed. The report has a special focus on financial applications. In particular, the report provides useful directions to financial firms intending to build private blockchains with Ethereum technology.\nR3 Senior Strategy Associate Kathleen Breitman and CTO Richard Gendal Brown wrote an executive summary of Buterin\u2019s report. \u201cIn R3\u2019s assessment of cryptographic currencies and ledgers, we evaluate each solution in terms of technical scalability, privacy and the ability to introduce automation into business processes through smart contracts,\u201d notes the executive summary. \u201cThere are many attractive features of the [Ethereum] platform: Ethereum natively supports Turing-complete smart contracts and the scripting language is user-friendly.\u201d\nThe first part of the executive summary, written by Breitman, summarizes the main points of Buterin\u2019s text from R3\u2019s perspective. Breitman notes that scalability is a key outstanding question for distributed ledger solutions in capital markets, and blockchain technologies are still very much behind, by orders of magnitude, the transaction throughput of mainstream financial networks. Ethereum developers are exploring two solutions to enhance the network\u2019s throughput: sharding and state channels.\nIn current Ethereum (and Bitcoin) networks, all transactions are replicated by all nodes, which limits the throughput of the entire network to that of one single node. A sharded network would be partitioned into different subnetworks, or shards, with transactions processed only by the subset of nodes in a shard. State channels \u2012 a generalization of the Lightning Network concept in Bitcoin \u2012 would permit conduct of most transactions off-chain, between parties directly, using the blockchain only as a kind of final arbiter in case of disputes.\nPrivacy is another important issue. R3 is not concerned with privacy in the libertarian, crypto-anarchic sense, but with the standard privacy requirements of financial markets. \u201cIn capital markets, it\u2019s non-negotiable that the open interests of all parties are adequately concealed,\u201d notes Breitman. Buterin notes that implementing privacy schemes is in the Ethereum roadmap, and in the meantime the developers of private Ethereum networks can go ahead and implement custom privacy-preserving solutions.\nButerin outlines the financial applications of Ethereum technology to use cases including blockchain-based processing of financial contracts and derivatives, other financial instruments on the blockchain, digitization of real-world assets, blockchain-based contracts for difference (CFDs) enforced by smart contracts, and collateral management. Some nonfinancial applications, such as identity verification, are useful in financial applications. Other important applications combine payments with nonfinancial services. For example, Ethereum smart contracts could permit creating decentralized versions of services such as Uber and handling the payments without the need for a company in the middle.\nThe second part of the executive summary, written by Brown, conveys R3\u2019s point of view. \u201cWe view Ethereum as a guide for new ways of thinking about distributed systems, as well as an excellent prototyping and simulation platform,\u201d he says. \u201cAs with all new technologies, extensive analysis and simulation will be required.\u201d\nBrown questions the suitability of adding scalability, privacy and business logic to an existing platform instead of having those built-in from the start. He says that R3 will continue to explore which aspects of existing platforms can inspire solutions to financial services problems and which aspects should be considered as not appropriate for R3\u2019s members.\n.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 14}

This enables developers and enterprises to work with IBM Blockchain code in the cloud. \u00a0As with IBM's other garages in San Francisco, London, Nice and Toronto, the New York Garage will invite startups and enterprises to collaborate in a creative environment outside of their traditional office setting.\nIBM is ramping up its efforts to become one of the top players in the emerging sector of distributed ledger technology. The company is a key member of Linux Foundation\u2019s Hyperledger Project, a collaborative effort started in December to establish, build and sustain an open source non-Bitcoin blockchain. In February, Bitcoin Magazine reported that IBM was deploying a Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) for developers and making tens of thousands of lines of code available to the Hyperledger Project. In April, IBM announced new cloud services based on the company\u2019s Hyperledger code and IBM\u2019s cloud platform, Bluemix.\nBluemix, on which more than 120,000 apps are launched every month, is becoming one of the largest open, public cloud deployments in the world. Based in open standards, it features more than 140 tools and services spanning categories of big data, mobile, Watson, analytics, integration, DevOps, security and the Internet of Things (IoT).\nTo promote its Bluemix cloud services for blockchain development, the company launched a \u201cBluemix Garage for blockchain\u201d initiative to \u201cdeliver business solutions that work\u201d by combining industry expertise with blockchain technology along with proven development methodologies such as Design Thinking and Agile Development. IBM intends to deploy Bluemix garages in major cities worldwide as hubs where developers, product managers and designers can come together to build on Bluemix. The IBM garages will be open to local companies to visit, ask questions to IBM experts and see demonstrations of business solutions built on the \u201cblockchain fabric\u201d from the Linux Foundation Hyperledger project.\nThe blockchain garages will have a business-oriented, as opposed to technology-oriented, approach. \u201cWe will explain IBM\u2019s Blockchain point of view in business terms, avoiding technical gobbledygook,\u201d states IBM. \u201cWe discuss what blockchain can and cannot do for business. We will encourage a dialogue (we don\u2019t like monologues!) to make sure we are on the same page.\u201d\nThe idea is to persuade potential clients to rely on IBM for blockchain technology development and deployment: \u201cIf we decide we are on the same page, we can talk logistics to get the customer hands-on with blockchain.\u201d\n\u201cGalvanize has been a great home and partner for IBM\u2019s groundbreaking Bluemix Garage on our San Francisco campus, and we are excited to bring that partnership to New York City,\u201d said Jim Deters, co-founder and CEO of Galvanize. \u201cHaving IBM\u2019s Garage in New York City, within the Galvanize community, allows our strong network of developers and startups to leverage the power of the cloud and the expertise of IBM to competitively innovate products and apps in the growing fintech and blockchain spaces.\u201d\nThe IBM press release notes that masses of developers, growing by 20,000 a week and projected to reach a global population of 25 million by 2020, are increasingly using Bluemix garages to tap into IBM Cloud APIs for blockchain technology, cognitive computing, IoT, unstructured data, social media and more to swiftly build and launch innovations.\nAccording to IBM, blockchain networks will vaporize current frictions in the economy that are inhibiting business growth, propelling the movement of capital and exchange of value. The company is also announcing a new blockchain project developed, in partnership with IBM\u2019s garage network worldwide, by Mizuho Financial Group in Tokyo.\n\u201cMizuho will explore how payments can be instantaneously swapped, potentially leading to new financial services based on this rapidly evolving technology,\u201d notes the new IBM press release.\nMizuho Financial Group announced that it is collaborating with the IBM Garage in Tokyo to find out how payment settlements could be implemented near-instantaneously using the codebase developed by IBM for the Hyperledger project. The project will use a virtual currency pegged to the yen, developed by Mizuho. With this project, Mizuho expects to better understand how payment settlements can be efficiently streamlined in a private, secure and permissioned blockchain network, with better tracking and control of the exchange of funds.\nIBM noted that this is one of several ways the bank is exploring the use of blockchain and creating a platform across the bank using the Linux Foundation Hyperledger code. They added that Mizuho is gaining confidence in the use of IBM\u2019s distributed ledger technology and sharing results with other Hyperledger members.\n\u201cIn this test, Mizuho will study the feasibility of blockchains with virtual currency in settlement business using the advanced applications development support service IBM Garage provided by IBM Japan,\u201d notes the Mizuho press release. \u201cIBM Japan will support Mizuho building a common platform to reform its development style such as designing and developing business applications using blockchains, with Mizuho's experience in system developments and IBM Japan's knowledge in global business services across various industries.\u201d\nImages via IBM, Galvanize", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 28}

Backed by Pando Group, a $250 million Chinese-Israeli venture capital fund headquartered in the British Virgin Islands, The Floor hosts local fintech entrepreneurs and provides access to Israeli fintech for leading international financial players, tech giants and venture capitalists. The hub has partnerships with international banks such as HSBC, RBS, Santander and Intesa Sanpaolo.\nThe Floor\u2019s business model seems similar to that of London-based innovation lab Level39, which in 2015 started hosting a blockchain innovation project of giant Swiss bank UBS.\n\u201cIntel brings a powerful multidisciplinary approach that could help Israel become a global capital in the field of fintech,\u201d said Gil Devora, cofounder of The Floor.\nIntel has been quietly building its expertise in distributed ledger technologies. In 2015, the tech giant started hiring engineers for a new research group dedicated to investigating hardware and software able to advance the performance, robustness and scalability of open, decentralized ledgers. Then, Intel became a member of the Hyperledger Project, a collaborative effort started in December under the leadership of the Linux Foundation to \u201cestablish, build and sustain an open, distributed ledger platform that will satisfy a variety of use cases across multiple industries.\u201d\n\u201cBlockchain technology can help enable secure transfer of digital assets among known and unknown parties,\u201d said Imad Sousou, vice president and general manager of the Open Source Technology Center at Intel. \"Intel looks forward to collaborating with the Hyperledger Project to advance the security, scalability and privacy of transactions in enterprise and permissionless systems.\u201d\nIn April, Intel unveiled its first contribution to the Hyperledger Project: the \u201cSawtooth Lake\u201d platform, a toolkit for companies that want to develop custom blockchains.\nIntel seems more interested in nonfinancial applications of distributed ledger technology, with a special focus on the IoT, an emerging sector that could benefit from the robustness and resiliency provided by distributed ledger technology.\n\u201cWhile Bitcoin is the most popular distributed ledger, the technology has been proposed for many different applications ranging from international remittance, insurance claim processing, supply chain management and the Internet of Things (IoT),\u201d notes the Sawtooth Lake documentation.\nFocusing on the IoT \u2012 the upcoming network of billions of always-on devices from environmental sensors to home appliances \u2012 makes a lot of sense for a hardware and firmware maker such as Intel. In fact, Intel is one of the tech companies best positioned to profit from the emerging IoT wave.\nBesides blockchain technology, the IoT and biometrics are among the stated focus areas of the new lab in Tel Aviv. Therefore, it seems plausible that Intel sees the new lab as part of an integrated strategy focused on smart, always-on personal devices.\nIntel has had R&D; operations in Israel for many years, but the new lab underlines the country\u2019s status as an emerging hub for advanced technology and finance. A\u00a0 recent Deloitte report notes that Israel, driven by a strong defense industry, technological military units and cutting-edge academic institutes, has become a hub for startups and hi-tech innovation. The country\u2019s unique experience with fintech, cyber and cryptography\u00a0has positioned Israel as a hotspot for blockchain innovation.\nAccording to Deloitte, Israel has the world\u2019s second-best entrepreneurial ecosystem, able to produce disruptive and cutting-edge innovations, with the highest concentration of technical companies outside of Silicon Valley and the highest number of NASDAQ-listed technology companies after the United States and China. The country, and specifically Tel Aviv, is rapidly positioning itself at the forefront of blockchain technology.\n\u201cThe fintech and cybersecurity industries, with obvious connections to blockchain technology, are two of the strongest fields within the Israeli startup community,\u201d notes the Deloitte report. \u201cAlthough the blockchain ecosystem is currently mostly associated with Bitcoin, the Israeli companies and entrepreneurs are developing solutions that have the potential to disrupt various industries.\u201d\n\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 15}

Participants contend the blockchain tokens\u00a0are going \u201cto the moon.\u201d Others argue, since they\u2019ve never been registered, they run afoul of securities law.\nThe second largest crowdsale and best known, is Ethereum at $18,439,086. Ethereum developers say their blockchain is a distributed smart-contract platform \u201cfueled\u201d by a native digital currency similar to Bitcoin. Ethereum\u2019s 2014 \u201cEther sale\u201d preceded it\u2019s May 2016 crowdsale for the DAO, a so-called \u201cdecentralized autonomous organization\u201d managed via Ethereum smart contracts.\nEthereum and DAO developers currently face scrutiny in the wake of a $55 million compromise of the DAO by an attacker. They are deciding whether to intervene and undo the damage done by the draining of funds.\u00a0\nDAO token holders, who purchased the tokens with Ether, vote on \u201cimportant decisions relating to the management of the DAO,\u201d the project claims. The DAO had raised Ethereum worth over $200 million at the time of the attack.\u00a0\nThe top five blockchain crowdsales: the DAO, Ethereum, WAVES, Lisk, Digix and Augur, have raised approximately $200 million. Nearly $170 million of that is Ethereum and the DAO.\u00a0\nLisk, a cryptocurrency and decentralized application platform, raised $5,880,089 in an \u201cinitial coin offering\u201d in 2016. Lisk founders worked on the code for three weeks before going public.\u00a0\n\u201cIn the following three weeks we built up enough momentum to start our crowdfunding,\u201d Lisk co-founder, Max Kordek, told me. The crowdfunding went on for one month and Lisk brought in more than 14,000 bitcoins.\u00a0\nKordek emphasizes the importance of marketing and calls Lisk\u2019s \u201cintensive marketing campaign\u201d a \u201chuge success.\u201d\u00a0\nSecurities Law\nDevelopers say they are providing access to software, not securities. The literature is littered with finance and security terms. Securities laws are broadly interpreted and designed to be adaptable to the innovative ways people raise funds.\u00a0\nCongress developed federal securities law after the stock market crash of 1929. The speculative frenzy ending in the October 1929 panic, called \u201cBlack Thursday,\u201dled Congress to enact the Securities Act of 1933 (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1945 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d).\u00a0\nState blue sky laws, Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations, as well as regulations from the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) combine to create securities law.\u00a0\nSEC v. W.J. Howey Co. (1946) set the precedent that an investment contract entails the giving of money to others who manage and control the funds with the expectation of profit.\nBlockchain crowdsales market that token holders and \u201ccommunity\u201d participants themselves, enjoy management and control of the blockchain software. Indicating that they, themselves, help build the blockchain platform over time. DAO participants, for instance, use Ether toward the DAO projects they support. Lisk says that participants earn Lisk for bug bounties.\u00a0\nIf blockchain crowdsale participants enjoy management and control, then it\u2019s arguably not an investment contract or security. Still, developers generally lack management and control over an enterprise in the real world.\nWho would shareholders petition to obtain redress when something goes awry? Core developers on Ethereum, etc. argue that \u201csmart contracts,\u201d that is, the distributed software itself, handles everything.\nJason Seibert, a lawyer who serves on Bitcoin and securities cases, described a typical blockchain crowdsale: \u201cHey, give us some money and we are going to develop something. We are not quite sure what it is yet but when we do, you\u2019ll be able to use this stuff for it, even though we don\u2019t know what it is yet.\u201d\nEven if the blockchain crowdsales are, in fact, crowdsales and not securities offerings, they must still be registered under the JOBS Act and regulation.\u00a0\nIllustrating the nuance of securities laws, Seibert evokes baseball cards:\n\u201cNobody thinks baseball card manufacturers print baseball cards with the intent of them being an investment,\u201d the Oregon-based lawyer, who represented Trendon Shavers in the first Bitcoin criminal fraud case in the U.S., said. \u201cCome on, it\u2019s sold in a pack of gum! But everyone knows that people can collect them and trade them and make money off of them.\u201d\u00a0\nBlockchain crowdsales come across much differently. They\u2019re not bubble gum and pictures of athletes. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about an investment opportunity,\u201d Seibert says.\u00a0\nHeretofore, blockchain crowdsales have enjoyed the unwritten \u201cgood deal exception,\u201d wherein, since everybody is happy, nobody files lawsuits or tips off relevant officials.\u00a0\nThat the DAO smart contract platform was drained of $55 million and core Ethereum developers are considering implementing a fork to roll back the perceived heist, it remains to be seen if the \u201cgood deal exception\u201d will soon expire. An SEC official commented June 20 that the $55 million attack against Ethereum underscores concerns over blockchain systems.\nThanks to the DAOs code, Ethereum developers could intervene and undo the $55 million drain. But that might be used in a court against them as proof they held control over Ethereum and the DAO. The DAO would not have truly been a \u201cdecentralized autonomous organism,\u201d as advertised, and participants could then be seen as misled investors.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ll generally hear an investor say, \u2018Had I know this-or-that, perhaps I would not have invested,\u201d Seibert explained.\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 29}

The draft will reportedly designate all virtual networks, data and information as property equal to physical and other financial assets, bringing them under the jurisdiction of civil rights that are applicable to property in general.\nOKCoin founder and CEO Star Xu told Bitcoin Magazine that the new draft law is good news saying:\n\n\"The central bank defined Bitcoin as a \"virtual commodity\" in 2013; however, digital assets are different from traditional properties in a sense due to their virtual features. That makes it difficult to be incorporated into the traditional \u2018object\u2019 which is normally categorized as \u2018chattel\u2019 and \u2018real estate.\u2019\n\n\n\u201cSince the Chinese law have not clearly defined the virtual asset in the past, property disputes involving \u2018virtual commodities\u2019 are difficult to be resolved under the existing law. This proposed new civil law draft, which includes digital assets with legal rights, will contribute to the protection of such property rights while also establishing a framework for the development of future specific rules.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIt is the manifestation of legal progress in China and it will benefit the Bitcoin industry in the long term.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese government has taken a wait-and-see stance until now, appreciating that China should not fall behind the rest of the world in innovations such as Bitcoin and blockchain technologies, but conscious, too, of the possible effect on China\u2019s central currency, the yuan.\u00a0\nHuobi Chief of Staff Yue Wen told Bitcoin Magazine that:\n\n\u201cWithout any doubt, the new draft of Civil Code is an improvement of Chinese law system, even though there is not much difference in enforcement until now. Based on our experience of cooperative investigation, bitcoins have been recognized as personal assets to protect in real cases. Policies will help to trace when citizens' bitcoins have been stolen.\u201d\n\nYue Wen explained:\n\n\u201cUntil now, the only legal document of Bitcoin was Notice for Preventing the Risks of Bitcoin, released by five commissions (People's Bank of China, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China, China Banking Regulatory Commission, China Securities Regulatory Commission, China Insurance Regulatory Commission) in 2013, in which Bitcoin has been defined as visual commodity. Visual commodity is not an object of any law in China so far, so we don't think there is any big difference now in enforcement.\u201d\u00a0\n\nHe added:\n\n\u201cAlso, the new draft is still a discussion version now, we're also paying attention to the progress and hoping for good news.\u201d\n\nIn a recent interview, BTCC CEO Bobby Lee acknowledged that the Chinese government has been signaling acceptance of the growth of Bitcoin trading in China for some time. He told Bitcoin Magazine that the central bank, PBOC, has indicated that it is open to new innovations and does not feel threatened by digital currencies.\n\n\u201cI do think that it is great that the PBOC is looking into the technology behind Bitcoin. I think all central banks should look into this technology, and look into adopting existing digital currencies like Bitcoin as part of their basket of reserve currencies.\u201d\n\nHowever, ChinaLedger, a research and development consortium of Wanxiang Blockchain Labs in China told CoinDesk that the language of the proposed law is too vague to be certain that it will include digital currencies.\nRoland Sun of ChinaLedger told CoinDesk that although the proposed definition could be expanded to include digital currencies, he said there is a \"long way to go\" before such a legal definition could be enacted.\nSun told CoinDesk:\n\n\"I don\u2019t expect a firm legislative recognition of the property rights of cryptocurrency [holders] in the next five or six years.\"\n\nDespite these reservations, the Chinese government, so far, has not denied that digital currencies would be included in the new law.\nThe Chinese constitution was amended in 2004 to introduce civil laws governing the individual\u2019s rights to own personal property, including lawful income, housing, savings, household items, books, reference materials, trees and livestock.\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 29}

As a first step, the U.N. wants to develop scalable identity systems by 2020. The inaugural \"ID2020 Summit \u2012 Harnessing Digital Identity for the Global Community,\" held at the United Nations headquarters in New York on May 20, brought together policymakers and technology companies to develop an action plan.\n\u201cWhile we don\u2019t profess to have solutions to these overwhelming problems today, we can start where the open source community is best: collaboration,\u201d said Yorke Rhodes III, blockchain business strategist at Microsoft. \u201cTo progress toward these goals, we have been working with partners to address identity using the self-owned or self-sovereign qualities of blockchain technology.\u201d\nThe Microsoft strategist said that the Redmond, Washington, giant is working with Blockstack Labs and ConsenSys to leverage their current Bitcoin and Ethereum-based identity solutions, Blockstack and uPort. Through this open source collaboration, Microsoft and its partners intend to produce a cross-chain identity solution that can be extended to any future blockchains or new kinds of decentralized, distributed systems. In the coming weeks an open-source framework for developers will be made available on Azure.\nBlockstack \u2012 an open source blockchain application stack \u2012 permits building decentralized, serverless apps by plugging into Blockstack's services for identity, naming, storage and authentication.\nAccording to the Blockstack team, Blockstack is the largest, most popular blockchain identity system, with 50,000 registered identities that come with profiles and globally unique names. Identities can be registered for people, companies, websites, software packages and more. Profiles can contain both private and public information, which is attested to by the user and can be verified by peers and select authorities.\n\u201cMicrosoft will make it easy to deploy new Blockstack servers and infrastructure on the Azure cloud and plans to integrate Blockstack with some internal systems for identity and authentication,\u201d notes the Blockstack blog. \u201cWith the Blockstack technology users are in complete control of their usernames and data and don\u2019t need to trust any third party for their information. We appreciate Microsoft\u2019s committed to making the internet a more secure and user-centric place and to promote open-source software development.\u201d\nIn November Bitcoin Magazine reported that Microsoft had partnered with ConsenSys, a blockchain startup focused on Ethereum technology, founded in October 2014 by Ethereum Foundation\u2019s co-founder Joseph Lubin. In December, Microsoft and ConsenSys announced Ethereum Blockchain as a Service (EBaaS) on Microsoft Azure, to provide a single-click cloud-based blockchain developer environment to Azure Enterprise clients and developers.\u00a0\nIn October, ConsenSys revealed that it was working on an identity management system\u200a called uPort\u200a. \u201c[We] have started to integrate an ID and persona construct across all of our dApps,\u201d noted the ConsenSys blog. \u201cSoon a uPort persona will enable access to any dApp ConsenSys or other developers build. ConsenSys has begun efforts to work with various partners towards standardization of these components.\u201d The company added that user-owned ID and data will be crucial for realizing the compelling vision of Web 3.0.\n\u201cWe\u2019re also collaborating with ConsenSys on a cross-blockchain solution for global namespaces,\u201d notes the Blockstack blog. \u201cWe believe that a global identity system should not be dependent on any particular blockchain and users should be able to migrate from one blockchain to another, if needed. Along these lines, we plan to work with ConsenSys to add Ethereum support to the Blockstack server.\u201d\nRedmond Magazine notes that there are many unofficial identity systems in the social media world, including the systems operated by Google, Facebook and Microsoft itself, as well as various emerging blockchain-based platforms that have been proposed for the online world. But the U.N. and the companies that participated in the inaugural ID2020 Summit are more ambitious: They want to develop globally recognized identity systems for the real world.\nOne-fifth of the world\u2019s population \u2012 one and a half billion people \u2012 are without proper identification, and 50 million children are born every year without a birth certificate and a legal identity. These numbers are growing, which underlines the importance of the U.N. goal of giving everyone on the planet a solid and tamper-proof digital identity based on common, interoperable standards. According to John Farmer, director of technology and civic innovation at Microsoft, blockchain technology can offer three key features to an identity system: It's an immutable, trustless, and transparent agreed-upon network.\n\u201c[We] can imagine a world where an individual can register their identity in a cross blockchain fashion, providing a single namespace for lookup regardless of blockchain of choice,\u201d concludes the Microsoft announcement. \u201c[We are] excited by the potential societal benefits that can be derived from an identity that transcends borders, blockchains, organizations and companies.\u201d\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 3}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin right now is not really anonymous. While Bitcoin addresses aren't necessarily linked to real-world identities, they can be. Monitoring the unencrypted peer-to-peer network, analysis of the public blockchain, and Know Your Customer (KYC) policy or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulation can reveal a lot about who's using Bitcoin, and for what.\nThis is not great from a privacy perspective. Bitcoin users might not necessarily want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own, while businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors \u2013 to name some examples.\u00a0\nAdditionally, bitcoins being traceable, possibly \u201ctainted,\u201d and potentially worth less than other bitcoins is at odds with fungibility. This could even challenge Bitcoin's value proposition as money.\nBut there are potential solutions to increase privacy, and improve fungibility.\u00a0\nOne of these solutions is \u201cConfidential Transactions.\u201d\nBackground\nAs opposed to most digital financial infrastructure, all typical Bitcoin transactions are recorded on the public blockchain, visible for anyone to see. This is required to validate transactions without any centralized authority, but also makes it trivial to trace how many bitcoins are sent from which addresses to which addresses.\nTo enhance privacy, it is possible to hide the amount of bitcoins transacted. An early version of this concept, then referred to as \u201cbitcoins with homomorphic value,\u201d was first\u00a0proposed in 2013 by hashcash inventor and current\u00a0Blockstream president Dr. Adam Back. The idea was later picked up by\u00a0Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developers Gregory Maxwell and Dr. Pieter Wuille and Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra. This eventually led to the implementation of Confidential Transactions in Blockstream's testnet-sidechain,\u00a0Alpha.\nHow It Works\nConfidential Transactions combine and utilize several cryptographic tricks, most notably\u00a0Borromean ring signatures and\u00a0Pedersen commitment schemes.\nWithout diving too deep into the cryptographic specifics, these tricks are applied so that only the sender and the receiver of a transaction are aware of the amount transacted. Everyone else would see only that bitcoins are transacted, but not know how many.\nThe clever thing is that, while some or all amounts are masked for \u201conlookers,\u201d these onlookers can still use the masked amounts for certain types of calculations. Specifically, all inputs of a transaction can be added up, all outputs can be added up, and the two sums can be compared to ensure they\u2019re equal \u2012 all while never revealing any of the masked amounts, nor the sums. As such, nodes can verify that no bitcoins were created out of thin air, without knowing how many bitcoins were actually sent.\n(On a side note, one of the amounts is always visible: the mining fee. That's to ensure miners can't award themselves too many fees, and has no further consequences from a privacy perspective. Other amounts can be made visible as well, if the sender or receiver so chooses.)\nSoft Fork\nPerhaps surprisingly, Confidential Transactions would be more or less compatible with the current Bitcoin-protocol. While the specifics need to be fleshed out, the solution can be rolled out as a soft fork \u2012 though it might be a bit \u201chacky.\u201d\nHere's how.\nTo ensure that \u201cold\u201d (non-upgraded) and \u201cnew\u201d (upgraded) nodes would remain in sync, bitcoins used in a Confidential Transaction would first have to be \u201cpass through\u201d an \u201canyone-can-spend\u201d address. This is a Bitcoin address that anyone can spend from, even without the corresponding private key or signature.\nOr so it seems to old nodes.\nNew nodes would recognize the address as the first step in a Confidential Transaction, and would accept only transactions from that address that do include the correct signature. As long as a majority of hash power applies these rules, the bitcoins on the anyone-can-spend address cannot be stolen by anyone who doesn\u2019t control the corresponding private key. (Old nodes might wonder why no one is spending the freely available bitcoins. But they also wouldn't mind that no one does; from their perspective, no protocol rules are being broken.)\nHere's where it gets interesting.\nIf a Confidential Transaction is made from the anyone-can-spend address, both old nodes and new nodes see that transaction. But they see something different. New nodes would recognize the transaction as a Confidential Transaction, and, for example, check that there are no bitcoins created from thin air. Old nodes, meanwhile, would be tricked into thinking it's a zero-bitcoin transaction: they would believe no bitcoins left the anyone-can-spend address at all.\nThis logic holds for each subsequent transaction. New nodes would see new transactions, and know that some amount of bitcoin is probably moved from address to address \u2013 though they'd have no idea how many. Old nodes, all the while, see \u201czero-bitcoin transactions,\u201d and believe all the bitcoins are still sitting in the anyone-can-spend address. (Old nodes might wonder why people are sending empty transactions to each other. But again, they wouldn't mind.)\nThe reason this won't cause havoc (specifically due to incompatible UTXO-sets) is that bitcoins received through a Confidential Transaction can initially be spent only as a Confidential Transaction. They are \u201clocked up\u201d in the anyone-can-spend address for now, and cannot visibly move over the Bitcoin blockchain at all.\nIn order to be able to spend these bitcoins in a normal transaction again, they must first \u201cpass through\u201d the original anyone-can-spend address. The receiver of a Confidential Transaction would have to send them back to the anyone-can-spend address, and from there start moving the coins in clear sight on the blockchain again.\nOnce they start moving in clear sight again, new nodes would check that not too many coins are being moved, while old nodes would simply assume the coins are moving for the first time since they were \u201clocked up.\u201d\nAs such, the anyone-can-spend address effectively functions as a cloaking device. Passing through the anyone-can-spend address makes the amounts of subsequent transactions invisible to all nodes. The bitcoins would \u201cre-appear\u201d only after they\u2019ve made it back to the original anyone-can-spend address.\nDownsides and Trade-offs\nUnfortunately, Confidential Transactions are no silver bullet for privacy.\nMost obviously, while Confidential Transactions mask amounts, onlookers can still see which address is paying which address.\nBut there are potential solutions to solve this as well.\nFor one, it's trivial to create false negatives and pay zero bitcoins to several addresses to obfuscate where the bitcoins really went. Additionally, Confidential Transactions could be particularly useful in combination with CoinJoin, which combines sending and receiving addresses from several transactions into a single, large transaction.\nAnother potential weakness of Confidential Transactions is that masked amounts are really only masked for that particular transaction. This can be rather pointless if a subsequent transaction is not a Confidential Transaction. The information from later transactions can sometimes be used to retroactively calculate how many bitcoins must have been involved in the Confidential Transaction.\n(For example: If Alice sends an unknown amount of bitcoins to Bob, and Bob subsequently sends 5 bitcoins to Carol and 2 to himself as change, it obviously means Alice sent 7 bitcoins to Bob.)\nThis means that Confidential Transactions are really useful only if such use is widespread. But that brings us to a perhaps even bigger problem: Confidential Transactions are quite resource-heavy. A Confidential Transaction is about 20 times bigger than a normal transaction, while it even increases computation thirtyfold. As such, the cost of each Confidential Transaction would be significantly higher compared to typical transactions, which provides a disincentive to people actually using them \u2013 diminishing their usefulness for everyone else as well.\nOn top of that, the sheer size of Confidential Transactions puts them at odds with either scalability (as the Bitcoin network would be able to handle fewer transactions), or decentralization (as fewer users would be able to run a full node and verify all transactions), or both.\nAnd last but not least: It's not clear that everyone agrees Bitcoin should be more private or fungible, which might further complicate rolling out potential soft forks like these.\nThanks to Pieter Wuille, Adam Back and\u00a0Monero\u00a0lead developer Riccardo Spagni for information and added feedback.", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 2}

This is how I ended up picking internet censorship as the problem to tackle and I figured that the best way to do it is by building a better channel of expression in the form of a decentralized publishing platform,\u201d Alisie said.\nTalking about censorship and how popular social media networks fail to uphold the idea of freedom of expression, Alisie said that the centralized architecture of popular social networks puts them in a situation where complying with censorship laws and regulations becomes necessary for them to stay in business.\u00a0\n\u201cI am not implying that there\u2019s necessarily some sort of evil agenda at play here, but we have seen numerous times how established companies have to comply with certain requests if they want to stay in business,\u201d Alisie wrote in a blog post.\n\n\"It just so happens that some of those requests involve censorship, and the root problem here is the information architecture used. This centralized\u00a0architecture enables the companies to honor such obnoxious requests in the first place.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAccording to Alisie, the team initially worked on developing AKASHA into something like a decentralized WordPress, but the project gradually evolved into something more interconnected and social that could be compared to a decentralized Medium or Reddit.\nThe team started developing a prototype of their platform last year using Ethereum, IPFS and the Meteor app development platform. But according to Alisie, Meteor was replaced by Electron, React and Node.js as it was not suitable for building what they had in mind.\u00a0\nHow It Works\nAccording to Alisie, when a user publishes an entry on AKASHA, an IPFS hash gets broadcasted to his or her network of followers. The IPFS hash then declares where interested people can access the content. No files get uploaded into the network until users start accessing the content.\nAddressing concerns raised about abusive content being shared on a censorship-free social network, Alisie said that AKASHA has a quadratic upvote/downvote mechanism similar to Reddit.\u00a0\nSo content that receives upvotes gets featured on the tags/keywords used, while also receiving ETH since it comes bundled with ETH microtransactions. The content that receives downvotes gets buried at the bottom of the keyword or tag used. But now that BTC Relay is live, Alise said that BTC could be used alongside ETH as a default token inside the AKASHA ecosystem as well.\u00a0\nWhen it comes to communities or groups where a number of people have publishing rights, Alisie said that users will be able to access a \u201cmoderated view\u201d \u00a0and unmoderated view of the content. He said his team will probably come up with a better solution in the beta release while they test current solutions in the alpha stage.\u00a0\nIn terms of access speed, \u00a0Alisie said that unlike centralized publishing platforms, the more people access something on AKASHA the faster it gets.\n\n\u201cIf the people who follow you (or the tags you used) read and appreciate the posted content, they \u2018pin\u2019 the IPFS content on their local machine and become similar to a BitTorrent seed.\u00a0\nThat, in turn, increases the access speed and redundancy of the content. Thanks to the peer-to-peer architecture and technologies used, the more people access something the better and faster it gets \u2012 quite opposite to how centralized publishing platforms work.\"\u00a0\n\nComparing AKASHA to similar blockchain-based social networks like Synero and\u00a0Datt,\u00a0Alisie said that having multiple experiments in the areas is important as it will help drive innovation.\u00a0\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to have multiple experiments in the area of social media, and I root for each and every one of them, because the issue we\u2019re tackling is too important for humanity as a whole to get caught in the \u2018competitor\u2019 game,\u201d Alisie said.\u00a0\nThe company said it will be doing an alpha release of AKASHA in a few weeks, but has not mentioned any specific dates yet. Interested parties can sign up for the alpha release on the AKASHA\u00a0website.\u00a0\nEditor's note: AKASHA CEO Mihai Alise was one of the original founders of\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine.", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 1}

One particular platform that could benefit from better asset tracking is the enterprise of scientific research.\nMy goal here is to outline an approach to enhance the reproducibility of scientific research through increased transparency using the blockchain and highlight a new use case for distributed ledger technology. Venture capitalists and commercial partners often shy away from investing in early life-science ideas because a lot of the research behind them has not proved to be reproducible with the same efficiency. I want to propose a training network on a publically available blockchain that research labs can join to openly prove their technology and reduce the risk for private investment opportunities. But first, we need to build some background on this topic.\n1. Research Grants\nScientists in research labs across public and private institutions carry out experiments to make discoveries that will one day improve the quality of life for all of us. Their observations and discoveries are documented in research papers, which are then published in journals pertaining to their subject areas. Most of this research is supported by funding sources such as the National Science Foundation (NSF) or the National Institutes of Health (NIH) which give out research grants. These grants provide financial support for the research labs to conduct experiments.\nThe publications detail the methods used by a group of scientists to perform an experiment and reach specific conclusions. The gold standard in science is the ability to replicate results. In this case, an independent research group should be able to follow those methods and reproduce the same conclusions. Sadly, we are learning that a large majority of the high-impact studies contain results which cannot be reproduced. In cancer research, Begley and colleagues [1] double- checked 53 high-impact studies and reported that 47 of them could not be replicated. There is no doubt that part of the issue has to do with the immense complexity of experiments being performed, but the bigger problem is that reproducibility is not incentivized in science.\nReproducing experiments done by other groups is a thankless job, and there is no novelty attached to reporting that you have repeated something that was already done. Scientific journals also refuse to publish duplicated experiments or results for the same reasons. As a result, it is a very difficult task to incentivize this tedious and labor-intensive process. To find solutions for this problem and enhance reproducibility in the scientific community, we must focus on the most basic unit of research that can be replicated: a published paper.\nGrants are acknowledged in publications as the funding source, and by tracking publications using a single shared resource, we can gain insights into the quality of research done by a lab. This is where a blockchain comes in: a decentralized ledger that can consistently record information to track research papers published by a lab. In what context will this tracking be organized? Let\u2019s discuss that next.\n2. Creating a Training Network\u00a0\nThe blockchain has two properties inherent in its design: transparency and accountability. We need to use both to create a review system for analyzing the quality of publications. This review system will organize peers (specializing in an area) into groups that can review each other\u2019s work. This goes back to the theme of blockchain as an enabling technology. In this case, the blockchain acts as the core infrastructure to enable the creation of a research network around tracking an asset (the publication).\nWe have to update the notion of a group operating on the blockchain following the requirements of this review system. A third property of the blockchain is the requirement for network-based consensus. We can extend this property beyond simple transactions to creating rules and criteria that all members can agree on as a network. This idea is similar to that of a decentralized organization (DO), where the members vote to adopt a set of standards which are then followed by everyone. This is a hybrid-DO where the members know each other, and they may have even collaborated with one another in the past.\nLet\u2019s define this type of organization as a decentralized peer group (DPG). Each DPG unit will be composed of members from a small number of research labs, and a cohort of DPG units can be simultaneously trained on the blockchain in this review system. Every DPG in the cohort will be deployed using a similar template which becomes the blueprint for a functional decentralized peer group.\nWhy do we need DPGs? The main purpose behind using a DPG is for the member labs to conduct token-based (the currency of this network) reviews of each other's work on the blockchain. In this case, the results of that review can be attached to the blockchain and become publically available. By using DPGs, we can also organize the cohort by subject areas.\u00a0\nNow that we have discussed how the network is structured, we are ready to talk how DPG reviews work and how they would leverage the blockchain technology in this system.\n3. Blockchain-Based Peer Reviews\nIn this cohort-based training system, we would have a few DPGs operational on the blockchain that can initially be managed by someone delegated through the DPGs, but eventually it would need staff. The management staff can eventually come from funding organizations such as the NIH or NSF.\nA DPG can be officially recognized as a part of the network when the members all vote to accept the standards outlined for the group. A blockchain-based training system can facilitate a tokenized review system involving penalties for group members who don\u2019t uphold the adopted standards. The purpose of these standards is to help improve the quality of publications and data produced by the member labs of a DPG.\u00a0\nBefore we get into the procedure of reviews, let's talk about how a DPG gets started.\nSetting Up a DPG\nThe DPG becomes operational in the cohort after it receives a wallet with some tokens. These tokens are provided to a DPG by the cohort managers and then distributed to all of the members through transactions. There will be no new infusion of tokens from the cohort managers through the remainder of the training. The reviews are conducted based on these tokens, and tokens might be awarded or taken away as a result of that review. The tokens left at the end of the training program will represent the progress made by the member labs. Some of the tokens that a DPG possesses are kept reserved, which we will talk about shortly. \u00a0\nInitially, a DPG is configured with a set of default user permissions and roles, where all users have equal privileges. But during a review session, the reviewer gains additional editing and uploading privileges. The member labs in a DPG can pick a reviewer to assess their progress through the training cohort. Their choice of reviewer along with some basic information about the grant, such as its duration, are added to a document and uploaded to the blockchain. This document is later modified during a review. The results of a review will be recorded in the Quality Review Document, and only the reviewer is allowed to make changes to it. The transactions that take place in the aftermath of a review will be tied to the review document and made publically available. At the conclusion of the review session, all the escalated reviewer privileges will be dissolved.\nOperation of Reviews\nDuring the review session, the reviewer examines the publications put out by the member lab and reference the DPG standards. The exit criteria for a successful review session is that the lab group being reviewed has met the minimum standards set forth by the DPG. These standards ensure that the work being published can be replicated to a high degree, while the lab is going through this training.\nIf any discrepancies are found during this examination, the member lab group will be penalized and have some tokens taken away from them. These tokens, along with recommendations for the member lab, will be attached to the Quality Review Document available on the blockchain.\nIf the lab group being reviewed did meet all the standards, they will be allowed to regain half the tokens they lost in previous penalties. This exchange of tokens will happen at every review, and the end value of each member lab will demonstrate how well they performed within the DPG. Eventually, the DPG will dissolve, but funding organizations can take a look at change in token values from each review to determine the success of the training program.\nThe quality reports and token balances could serve as indicators of future success with research and generating high quality publications. In this manner, a funding organization can start training cohorts of DPGs that are self-sufficient for high research standards. The work produced by labs that have gone through this kind of training will be highly reproducible and impactful. This review process is demonstrated visually in the figure below.\n\nFigure 1: The reviewer begins the review session for a member lab of the DPG. She uses the Quality Review Document to provide recommendations to the member lab. These results and any associated penalties are stored on the blockchain and made publicly available.\n4. New Opportunities\nTraining cohorts of research scientists about commercial and practical feasibility is not new for the NSF. There is already another NSF program called the Innovation Corps (I-Corps) that trains teams of scientists and students in the process of customer discovery. This training network attempts to develop confidence in the basic science of a member lab by validating the new and impactful research in an open, transparent and constructive manner. \u00a0\nThe advantage is that once the basic sciences have been validated in such a rigorous manner, commercial interest and opportunities start to spring up. Commercial entities can start taking your work more seriously because your work has not only been peer reviewed, but also independently replicated. This training program becomes a sign of trust and a future indicator of successful commercial incubation. These labs understand that having your basic sciences validated can produce valuable startups and draw commercial interest toward their existing infrastructure.\u00a0\nAny startups that spin out of the member labs will find it much easier to get private investment after having proved their technology. In the end, these labs will be able to provide meaningful additions and contributions to the growing areas of science and transition their products from bench to bedside.\n\u00a0\nReferences:\n1.

The bank plans to make the application, which is only available on Apple\u2019s iOS, available to consumers after it completes the pilot program. The announcement makes Santander the first bank in the U.K. to use blockchain for international payments.\nThe new Santander app connects to Apple Pay, where users can confirm payments securely using Touch ID. It lets users transfer between \u00a310 and \u00a310,000, and payments can be made from British pounds to euros and U.S. dollars. Currently, payments made in euros can be sent to 21 countries and U.S. dollar payments to the United States only.\n\u201cThe need for finance has evolved from providing a physical pound in your pocket or card in your purse, where you pay at a till, to being seamlessly integrated into a new, always on, connected lifestyle,\u201d said Sigga Sigurdardottir, head of customer and innovation at Santander. \"At Santander we work hard to ensure our banking is simple, personal and fair and believe new blockchain technology will play a transformational role in the way we achieve our goals and better serve our customers, adding value by creating more choice and convenience.\"\nThe Santander app is powered by the blockchain technology implementation developed by Ripple, a company in which Santander Innoventures, the $100 million fintech venture capital fund of Santander Group, has invested. Working with Ripple builds on Santander\u2019s philosophy of collaborating with the most innovative companies to consistently provide better services to customers. In June 2015, Bitcoin Magazine reported that, in a paper titled \u201cThe Fintech 2.0 Paper: Rebooting financial services,\u201d Santander Innoventures issued \u201ca call to action to banks, financial institutions and financial technology (fintech) businesses to work together to undertake a fundamental \u2018reboot\u2019 of the core processes, systems and infrastructure of the banking industry.\u201d\nAccording to Ripple, its technology offers a real-time cross-currency settlement solution that is flexible enough to comply with the risk policy, privacy and compliance needs of banks. \u201cIt is architected to fit within your bank\u2019s existing infrastructure, resulting in minimal integration overhead and business disruption,\u201d notes the Ripple website.\n\u201cRipple is redefining the way that value moves around the world, and today we\u2019re already enabling real-time, affordable international settlement between banks who have adopted our solutions,\u201d said Ripple cofounder and CEO Chris Larsen. \u201cAs an early adopter and pioneer in the banking industry, Santander is the first bank in the world to transfer real funds externally. In doing so, they are creating a new, exemplary standard of service.\u201d The Ripple announcement notes that security and regulatory compliance is central to all activity undertaken at Santander and their Ripple-powered app has already undergone the same rigorous testing all new technology goes through ahead of roll out.\nThe move is a much-needed response to the upcoming wave of digital payment providers that threatens to lure customers away from the banks.\n\u201cClearly, it\u2019s an area where, as an industry, we don\u2019t have as good a customer experience as we could do\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009there are a lot of pain points,\u201d said Ed Metzger, head of innovation, technology and operations at Santander U.K., as reported by The Financial Times. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of activity in international payments.\u201d Metzger added that the reason why new digital players have been able to make progress is because \u201ccustomer experiences through normal channels aren\u2019t great.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time a U.K. bank has sent payments of this type via Ripple and launched it as a commercial service,\u201d Metzger told Bloomberg News. \u201cMany people are doing lab style experiments, the key difference here is about getting real people to send real money for real purposes. I just paid my wife, who is Spanish, some money to a Spanish bank account this morning.\u201d\nBloomberg News notes that Santander is one of several major banks, including Citigroup, UBS and Barclays, striving to find ways to exploit the distributed ledger technology behind Bitcoin to cut costs and stay at the leading edge of modern fintech.\nIn April, Bitcoin Magazine reported that Barclays formed a partnership with \u201cBitcoin bank\u201d Circle in a move that received welcoming support from U.K. authorities. Barclays Corporate Banking is providing the account that Circle needs to store sterling for consumers and the infrastructure to allow transfers from any U.K. bank account in and out of Circle. An interesting feature of the Barclays/Circle initiative is that it uses the standard, public Bitcoin blockchain, instead of an alternative implementation.", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 1}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin right now is\u00a0not really anonymous. While Bitcoin addresses aren't necessarily linked to real-world identities, they can be. Monitoring the unencrypted peer-to-peer network, analysis of the public blockchain, and Know Your Customer (KYC) policy or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulation can reveal a lot about who's using Bitcoin, and for what.\nThis is not great from a privacy perspective. Bitcoin users might not necessarily want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own, while businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors \u2013 to name some examples.\nAdditionally, bitcoins being traceable, possibly \u201ctainted,\u201d and potentially worth less than other bitcoins is at odds with fungibility. This could even challenge Bitcoin's value proposition as money.\nBut there are potential solutions to increase privacy, and improve fungibility.\u00a0\nA solution that has been around for a while is CoinJoin.\nBackground\nAt its heart, the Bitcoin protocol consists of transactions. All these transactions are completely public on the blockchain, which means that anyone can see which addresses sent bitcoins to which addresses. If some of these addresses are linked to real world identities, it can reveal who transacted with whom \u2012 or what for. This is at odds with privacy and \u2013 in particular \u2012 fungibility.\nAdditionally, each particular transaction spends one or several \u201cinputs,\u201d referring to the addresses bitcoins are sent from. (These inputs are spent to \u201coutputs,\u201d referring to the addresses bitcoins are sent to.) This poses another challenge to privacy and fungibility, since all input-addresses would typically belong to the same user: the sender of the transaction. If even one of all clustered input-addresses can be linked to a real-world identity,\u00a0all\u00a0of them are.\nCoinJoin \u2013\u00a0proposed in 2013 by Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developer Gregory Maxwell \u2013 is designed to solve both these problems. It obfuscates the trail of bitcoins and breaks the assumption that all input-addresses belong to the same user.\nThe Idea\nThe CoinJoin concept is fairly straightforward.\nEssentially, CoinJoin lets multiple users combine all inputs and outputs from several transactions into a single, big transaction. This single transaction spends bitcoins from different addresses to different addresses \u2013 and since none of the sending addresses pay none of the receiving addresses specifically; there's no link between any of them.\n(This can be compared to a group of people who throw their cash together and go shopping. While everyone could make sure no one spends more than they should, the shoppers wouldn't necessarily spend the exact bills they originally put into the shared wallet themselves.)\nIn Bitcoin, this can be accomplished perfectly securely. All inputs require a corresponding signature from their respective owner, while the content of a transaction cannot be changed after a signature is added. As such, participants of a CoinJoin transaction simply announce which inputs and outputs they want to include in the transaction, and sign the aggregate only if these inputs and outputs are correctly included. Once all participants have signed (and only once they have signed), the transaction is broadcast.\nA key feature of CoinJoin: once the transaction is broadcast and included on the blockchain, there is no way of knowing which bitcoins went where; not even the recipients of the transaction will know from which addresses they got paid.\nAdditionally, CoinJoin improves privacy even of those who don't use it at all. Since a combination of inputs no longer necessarily means that all of the input-addresses belong to the same user, clustering has become a less powerful analytics tool in general.\nIn Practice\nCoinJoin does not require any changes to the Bitcoin protocol, and there are several implementations of it already. The main difference between some of the versions out there is how the CoinJoin transaction is created.\nThe easiest way to create a CoinJoin transaction is through a dedicated server. Anyone who wants to use CoinJoin would simply connect to the server to indicate which inputs and outputs the transaction should include. The server then creates a big aggregate transaction, and sends this back for all participants to sign.\u00a0DarkWallet \u2013 the privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet that seems stuck in its alpha phase \u2013 employs a server-based model, as does the popular\u00a0Blockchain web wallet, though its effectiveness has been questioned in the past.\nThe main problem with the server-based model, is that whoever controls the server would typically have access to the data provided by the individual participants. As such, this server presents a single point of failure from a privacy and fungibility perspective. There are potential solutions to cryptographically mask transaction data even from the server, but this is still theoretical for now.\nThere are also decentralized CoinJoin solutions, that construct CoinJoin-transactions peer-to-peer, or at least without any particular central intermediary. There have been several attempts in this direction, including\u00a0Coinmux,\u00a0Coinjumble,\u00a0CoinJoiner\u00a0and former DarkWallet developer Amir Taaki's\u00a0CoinJoin tool. But none of these are widely used, and therefore not very useful\u00a0\u2013 \u201ccoinjoining\u201d makes sense only when there's someone to join with.\nA more recent take on the CoinJoin strategy that intends to tackle this problem is\u00a0JoinMarket: a marketplace for CoinJoin transactions. Users can offer a spot in a CoinJoin transaction in return for a small fee \u2013 or buy access to a CoinJoin transaction themselves. The creators of JoinMarket believe that the incentive to mix coins in return for fees should generate enough liquidity to make the market a success \u2013 while the competitive nature of it should keep fees low. Indeed, JoinMarket is relatively well used compared to alternatives, and the order book (at the time of writing) offers thousands of bitcoins to mix with.\nLastly, another privacy-focused wallet,\u00a0Samourai Wallet, currently includes a type of CoinJoin imitation, designed to throw off whoever is analyzing blockchain data. This option makes transactions appear like CoinJoin-transactions, while in reality all inputs and outputs belong to the same user. (Samourai Wallet plans to expand build-in and cross-wallet mixing options later this year, which might also utilize CoinJoin functionality.)\nDownsides and Trade-Offs\nWhile CoinJoin can be useful \u2013 it's not perfect.\nMost important, while CoinJoin does a great job at mixing inputs and outputs, this is not sufficient if the amounts are revealing. If one input sends 4.9 bitcoins, another input sends 2.7 bitcoins and a third inputs sends 0.8 bitcoins, while one output receives 4.9 bitcoins, one receives 2.7 bitcoins and a third receives 0.8 bitcoins, then it's simple to connect inputs to outputs.\nA potential solution to this problem, of course, are\u00a0Confidential Transactions. Since Confidential Transactions mask the amounts sent (but not the inputs and outputs), CoinJoin and Confidential Transactions are a potentially powerful combination.\nAnother risk is that of\u00a0Sybil attacks. Seemingly multiple participants in a CoinJoin transaction can really be one and the same entity, monitoring a particular participant.\n(If nine-of-ten inputs and outputs belong to a single NSA-agent sending bitcoins to himself, he would know which remaining output sent bitcoins to which remaining output.)\nThere is no easy solution for the problem of Sybil attacks, but as more genuine users mix their coins, it does become significantly harder to pull off successfully.\nWhich brings us to the next point: CoinJoin is still a hassle. Almost no wallets have it built in, and those that do aren't used a lot (and rely on a central server.) JoinMarket is probably the most successful implementation to date, but still requires special software and additional fees (though small).\nBut an interesting development on the horizon might skew these incentives:\u00a0Schnorr signatures. Enabled by Segregated Witness, Schnorr signatures could allow for the aggregation of all signatures in a CoinJoin transaction into a single signature. This efficiency should result into lower transaction fees per input, and perhaps stimulate use of the most private and fungibility-friendly solution.\nThanks to Gregory Maxwell for added feedback.", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 6}

Following the vote, unnamed sources told Ars Technica that European Commission staffers are working hard to understand the distributed ledger technology behind virtual currencies \u2012 seven years after the launch of Bitcoin, with venture capital investments now totalling more than \u20ac1 billion.\nThe MEPs voted in a proposal, set out in a resolution (a short summary is also available) drafted by Jakob von Weizs\u00e4cker, which suggests that a new task force, which would be overseen by the European Commission, should build expertise in the underlying technology of virtual currencies. The proposal, which was passed by 542 votes to 51, with 11 abstentions, will now be sent to the European Commission.\nThe original title of the EU Parliament\u2019s press announcement \u2012 \u201cMEPs call for virtual currency watchdog to combat money laundering and terrorism\u201d \u2012 seems to indicate that the MEPs voted in favor of a heavy-handed approach to blockchain technology regulation. But, as rightly noted by International Business Times, the title is misleading. The press announcement combines two different initiatives. One is the creation of a Virtual Currency Task Force, and the other is the inclusion of virtual currency exchanges within the scope of the European Anti-Money Laundering Directive. Neither of these implies the creation of a new regulator as such.\nThe proposal clearly states that distributed ledger technology should not be stifled by regulation at this early stage. The new task force would also be tasked with recommending any necessary legislation, but the text warns against taking a heavy-handed approach to this new technology which, it says, can offer significant opportunities for the consumer and economic development.\n\"To avoid stifling innovation, we favor precautionary monitoring rather than preemptive regulation. But IT innovations can spread very rapidly and become systemic. That's why we call on the commission to establish a task force to actively monitor how the technology evolves and to make timely proposals for specific regulation if, and when, the need arises,\" said von Weizs\u00e4cker.\n\u201cWhat we advocate in the report is not to stifle innovation by regulating now, but instead to closely monitor what is going on by the creation of a task force which we suggest should be created at the level of the commission, and then to regulate \u2012 if and when the time is right to do so and if and when the structures to do so are in place,\u201d reads the short version of Weizs\u00e4cker\u2019s report. \u201cThat of course doesn\u2019t mean that we shouldn\u2019t do anything right now. For example, in the report we greatly welcome the suggestion of the commission to apply the Anti-Money Laundering Directive immediately for virtual currencies.\u201d\n\"The starting point is not to regulate \u2012 although you'd be forgiven for thinking it was [to regulate] when you read the headline from the press release,\u201d Si\u00e2n Jones, of the European Digital Currency and Blockchain Technology Forum, told International Business Times. \"You might think here is Europe stepping in to regulate stuff, but actually if you read the report then you will realize that it's highly supportive. It's not proposing a watchdog body in the sense of a quango [quasi-autonomous, nongovernmental organization] or some other agency. The report definitely doesn't call for that kind of a body. The report is saying the EU is not trying to regulate virtual currencies in a day-to-day sense, but rather to allow the technology to continue to innovate.\"\n\u201cI agree that this is both an important and exciting area, and I welcome the very balanced approach to keep an eye on developments, embrace the opportunities, but be alert to the dangers,\u201d said Finance Commissioner Jonathan Hill. \u201cIn recent months we have accelerated our work to examine whether it could be linked to funding terrorism activities.\u201d Hill added that the EU Commission plans to set up a fintech task force.\nLike many official documents issued by EU authorities, this resolution has a relatively high degree of purposeful ambiguity, and can be interpreted in different ways. It appears that the EU authorities intend to keep all doors open at this moment, in such a way as to keep the EU innovation engine running while at the same time developing options to intervene rapidly in case of need. In fact, the resolution emphasizes the differences between smart regulation and a hands-off approach.\n\u201cThe key to smart regulation in such an environment of dynamic innovation is for the regulator to develop sufficient capacity, including technical expertise,\u201d reads the full version of Weizs\u00e4cker\u2019s report. \u201cPreemptive and heavy-handed regulation that would stifle growth should and can be avoided. But such a smart regulatory regime based on analytical excellence and proportionality must not be confused with light-touch regulation. Rapid and forceful regulatory measures need to be part of the tool kit in order to address risks before they become systemic if and when appropriate.\u201d\nPhoto\u00a0David Iliff / Wikimedia", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 3}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nPayPal has been forced to cease operations in Turkey. The shutdown will go into effect on June 6. Turkey recently denied PayPal of a new license, which is required to operate within the country. According to TechCrunch, the reason for the denial was that PayPal does not localize all of their IT infrastructure inside of Turkey.\nTo get a clearer picture of what\u2019s going on in Turkey, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Emre Kenci, CTO and co-founder of BTCTrader, which owns and operates Turkish Bitcoin exchange BTCTurk.\nWill Other Online Payment Providers Leave Turkey?\nAccording to Kenci, PayPal\u2019s reasons for leaving Turkey may also apply to other payment providers. Then again, others are able to earn exemptions. \u201cBusinesses like Western Union have been exempt from the law,\u201d said Kenci.\n\u201cIf the business is holding funds on behalf of the consumer, for the purpose of allowing the consumers to transfer money to other consumers or businesses, then the business needs an electronic money license,\u201d explained Kenci. \u201cIf the business does not hold any consumer funds but allows businesses to accept payments, then they need a payment processor license. Electronic money license holders are allowed to operate as payment processors. So the latter license is a subset of the former. Each business is evaluated by the regulator on a case-by-case basis.\u201d\nKenci also noted the regulation goes far beyond the reported requirement to keep all IT infrastructure within the country\u2019s borders. \u201cEverything from the organization chart to the CV of the CEO, from the paid capital of the business to how funds are held in bank accounts, [and] financial and security audits are within the scope of the regulation. And there are specific rules for each,\u201d he explained.\nKenci added that all of these requirements create a barrier to entry for small businesses who wish to experiment with new, innovative ideas.\nIn terms of Kenci\u2019s own business, he holds the view that the activities of BTCTurk do not fall within the scope of this law. \u201cThe regulation's scope is holding and allowing the transfer of funds in currencies recognized by the central bank of Turkey,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe regulator has deemed that bitcoin is out of this scope.\u201d\nCan Bitcoin Help for International Transfers?\nAlthough there has been a large amount of hype around the use of Bitcoin for international money transfers and remittances, real data on this sort of use case is not yet widely available. According to Kenci, SWIFT is the most popular method of sending money abroad, especially for amounts larger than $1,000.\n\u201cThe banking infrastructure in Turkey is quite efficient, the digital channels (mobile, web) work well, and the transfer costs are below international rates,\u201d explained Kenci. \u201cRemittance companies, such as Western Union, are also well established and are available as embedded services in almost every bank.\u201d\nWhere Can Bitcoin Help?\nAccording to Kenci, PayPal was mainly helpful for transfers of small amounts of money and digital payments in Turkey. \u201cWe believe that this presents a good opportunity for Bitcoin,\u201d he added.\nAlthough Kenci said the recent PayPal news has helped with the PR presence of Bitcoin in Turkey, he also added that the maturity of Bitcoin services in Turkey and the rest of the world are not yet at a level where the technology can fill a void left by PayPal. Having said that, he also noted, \u201cIt is certain that the Turkish user base of PayPal will struggle to find a direct replacement.\u201d\nIn terms of where Bitcoin is useful in general, Kenci explained, \u201cThe interest in Bitcoin, as we saw in Greece via our partner BTCGreece, increases when the existing financial infrastructure does not function, when there are strong capital controls or when people lose trust in national currencies as we currently see in China.\u201d\nAccording to Kenci, the financial infrastructure is strong in Turkey, and despite having weakened in the last year and a half, the Turkish lira continues to instill trust in a large part of the population as a store of wealth.", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 2}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nAs blockchain fever is taking hold of prominent financial industry firms around the globe, two men from Kentucky believe to have found the key to rewire international supply chain infrastructure.\nFluent cofounders Lamar Wilson (CEO and developer) and Lafe Taylor (CDO) recently unveiled the Fluent Network, a blockchain-based financial operating network to streamline supply chain finance. And they've got $2.5 million in seed funding to back their efforts.\nFrom Pheeva Wallet to Blockchain Startup\nWilson and Taylor, who previously founded the Pheeva Bitcoin wallet for iOS, are not your typical Stanford-dropout fintech architects.\nFar removed from both the old money in the incumbent financial sector, as well as the new money in Silicon Valley, Wilson and Taylor met at their high school in Lexington, Kentucky. Having first discovered Bitcoin back in 2011, the two founded the Pheeva wallet in 2014, the only iOS-compatible Bitcoin wallet throughout Apple's anti-Bitcoin era.\nIn that same year, 2014, Wilson and Taylor also increasingly shifted their focus to Bitcoin's underlying technology, the blockchain. And \u2013 like many others \u2013 they became convinced that the innovative distributed ledger technology could fuel a parallel revolution to Bitcoin's: a revolution specifically geared toward removing friction from the existing financial infrastructure.\nBuilding on this vision, Wilson and Taylor founded their second venture, Fluent. And, after months of research, they pinpointed a niche they believed could be significantly improved by blockchain technology: supply chain finance. Mirroring logistical supply chains, often composed of dozens or even hundreds of production steps, supply chain finance consists of a long series of ledgers and processes maintained by individual operators.\nThis is an inefficient infrastructure, ripe for disruption, according to Taylor:\n\n\u201cMost financial supply chains right now consist of very siloed and opaque systems, which is tremendously inefficient. And, to make it worse, large companies at the head of these supply chains typically push out payment terms as far as possible to increase their cash flow. This puts a lot of pressure on suppliers in particular; they need the cash as fast as they can in order to pay their employees, buy raw materials, and other expenses.\u201d\n\nThe solution, Wilson and Taylor believe, is blockchain technology.\nIn particular, the Fluent Network benefits from the introduction of tokenized invoices. Tracking and approving invoices on a blockchain prevents them from being refinanced (\u201cdouble-spent\u201d), but perhaps more important: significant stages of the payment process can be automated and harmonized.\nWilson:\n\n\u201cBuyers, for instance, approve of invoices on the Fluent Network once they consider goods delivered to be satisfactory. The buyer of a good on the due date can automatically pay the invoice directly to whomever owns the invoice even if it has been partially financed by multiple parties or subsequently purchased by other finance providers. A single platform with cryptographically verified invoices, instant settlement and low operating costs benefits all parties on the system. It\u2019s a win-win-win for the buyer, supplier and financier.\u201d\n\nA Blockchain on Top of Banking\nThe Fluent Network's blockchain is largely based on Bitcoin's architecture, but purpose-built for global supply chains with specific focus on invoicing and payments. It is perhaps best described as a blockchain layer on top of the existing banking infrastructure. The actual funds \u2013 typically U.S. dollars \u2013 remain in custody of banks at all times, though they are tokenized and represented on the blockchain, too. The network is to be rolled out among financial institutions, as well as global enterprises that take part in the supply chain.\nUnique to the Fluent Network, the custom-built private blockchain is comprised of a hybrid consensus model, with both a federated system as well as proof-of-work security. The proof-of-work security \u2013 SHA-256 \u2013 works similar to the way it does in Bitcoin, but with one great difference: mining is not an open process anyone can participate in, but a closed circuit where participants are permissioned by Fluent.\n\u201cParticipants of a supply chain, including financial institutions, can sign up to become a node and miner on the Fluent Network,\u201d Taylor explained. \u201cAs a federated system, participants do require permission to mine; we know who the miners are, as does the rest of the network. But within this permissioned infrastructure, we solidify the core with a proof-of-work system.\u00a0Think of giving permission to your neighbors to come to an open house\u00a0but locking up the good China for extra security. Also, because we know who the miners are, we don't need nearly as much hashing power as you would on a permissionless blockchain.\u201d\nAnd while miners on the network \u2013 the financial institutions and other companies \u2013 can't earn a native token by mining, the Fluent team believes securing the network should be incentive enough.\nAccording to Wilson, \u201cThis could prove to be an important step in opening up and connecting to trustless value chains in an industry 4.0 economy. Blockchains, at the end of the day, are fantastic tools with a specific purpose. We plan on using the best tool for the job.\u201d\nWilson and Taylor are not the only ones to think so. Fluent closed a pre-seed financing round last year, raising a total of $875,000, followed by $1.65 million in seed funding in 2016 in a round led by ff Venture Capital, with participation from institutional investors including Tim Draper's Draper Associates, Thomson Reuters, 500 Startups, UMB Bank and SixThirty. The platform is now being tested, with participants including a top-ten bank on Forbes\u2019 2015 America\u2019s Best Bank list. Fluent will be presenting a demo of the Fluent Network at next week's\u00a0Distributed: Trade conference in St. Louis hosted by BTC Media,\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine's parent company.", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 7}

The consulting, technology and outsourcing services provider operates\u00a0in more than 40 countries and employes around 180,000 people worldwide.\nIn a bid to continually improve\u00a0its consulting services, it seems as though Capgemini has caught the blockchain bug. In November, the company published a\u00a0report advising clients that financial service firms could \u201cno longer afford to ignore blockchain tech.\u201d Not long after that, in mid-April, Capgemini introduced a range of\u00a0blockchain consulting services for finance and banking.\nThis announcement will mark the first venture for Capgemini into blockchain-based loyalty reward programs. It will enable banks to have the flexibility to offer consumers the ability to combine loyalty points from various programs that is cost-efficient and secure while providing consumers with the ability to use them in real time across multiple merchants.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Bruce Pon, CEO of BigchainDB, part of Ascribe, said that one of the main ways to achieve wider adoption and scale for BigchainDB was to partner with consulting firms such as Capgemini that understand the business challenges of their clients and the technology requirements to implement solutions.\n\u201cIt became clear very early on that we needed a buffer between us and the enterprises lest we divert our entire technical team to answering the myriad of questions that enterprises have,\u201d Pon said. \u201cBy partnering with Capgemini, BigchainDB can focus on building out the core technology, providing technical support and high level strategy while Capgemini focuses on the detailed requirements, specifications, implementation, testing and rollout to get real-world systems into production for their clients.\u201d\nCapgemini decided to partner with\u00a0Ascribe\u2019s new blockchain service BigchainDB, because of the scalability model.\u00a0\n\u201cBigchainDB was built from the realization that enterprises were solving a different class of problems than Bitcoin was architected for,\u201d said Pon. \u201cBigchainDB is much more aligned to non-cryptocurrency use cases such as messaging, transactions, metering and registry systems, things which Bitcoin wasn\u2019t built to accommodate.\u201d\nLast June, Ascribe launched its digital intellectual property tracking service, setting out how to build the ownership layer of the internet. In February, the company then followed this up with the launch of its BigchainDB project, which\u00a0is an alternative blockchain designed to handle a high number of transactions per second.\n\u201c\u2018Blockchainified\u2019 databases are databases that are highly tamper-resistant and more fault tolerant than traditional databases because of the decentralized consensus,\u201d said Pon. \u201cThis opens up an entirely new set of use cases, such as a global registry for intellectual property claims, loyalty and points schemes that aren\u2019t tied to one organization, metering of usage and energy generation in a network grid.\u201d\nAll of these use cases, then, require a solution that is primarily a database, but with blockchain characteristics.\nWhile the program details have yet to be disclosed, Pon told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine\u00a0that Capgemini has a set of use cases that clients have expressed an interest in, with a loyalty points scheme being one of them.\n\u201cThis use case is attractive because it allows both parties to work on a problem, get to know how to engage with each other and marshals the team within Capgemini to build a solution that can be used by one of their clients,\u201d he said.\nMoving forward with BigchainDB, last week Ascribe released version 0.4 with enterprises and developers already able to roll out their own private BigchainDB in addition to building apps on the platform. In the future,\u00a0Ascribe plans to announce a public instance of BigchainDB, which Pon believes will provide significant benefits that the internet doesn't offer today.\n\u201cOur original project will use the public BigchainDB to enable artists to declare their authorship, define licensing, and transfer rights for free, while preserving provenance of the work,\u201d he said. \u201cThis opens up the possibility for content creators to manage and track usage of their works globally, so that they can be properly compensated.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 7}

The project represents the first step in a broader undertaking that is focused on creating new technologies and collaborating to evolve standards that lift the entire ecosystem.\nThe MIT Media Lab's Learning Initiative integrates learning-related projects across different research groups, develops new technologies for creative learning, and uses the Media Lab as a platform for new conversations about learning. Learning Machine is a provider of enterprise software for higher education with products to manage recruitment, enrollment, portfolio review, faculty hiring and credentialing.\n\"The goal of our collaboration with the MIT Media Lab is to empower individuals with shareable credentials that can be used peer-to-peer and verified as authentic,\u201d said Chris Jagers, co-founder and CEO of Learning Machine. \u201cThe current system for sharing official records is slow, complicated, expensive and broken for everyone in a myriad of ways. The first generation of students to grow up entirely during the internet age have started applying for college, and many admissions officers can share stories about applicants trying to text photos of their academic records. The expectation, while seemingly humorous, conveys an honest impression about the way things should work. It should be that easy for people to share certified records directly with others and have them trusted as authentic.\"\nCertificates registered on the blockchain allow schools and employers to issue digital proof of membership, achievement or completion in a shareable format, which students can use when applying for work or further education. The open standard technology developed by Learning Machine and the MIT Media Lab permits cryptographically placing documents on the public blockchain along with a certificate viewer. An open-source version of the technology has been released under the MIT license, and a commercial version is available from Learning Machine.\n\u201cBlockchain verification flips the current power arrangement in higher education by giving learners control over their official documents,\u201d said Learning Machine President and COO Dan Hughes. \u201cToday, most evidence of achievement is bottled up in a proprietary information system or stored unofficially on a piece of paper framed on a wall or lost in a box in the garage. Jailbreaking the credential is about every learner being able to directly see and share verified evidence of what they have achieved. A curated view of one\u2019s achievements, shared at whatever level of granularity is appropriate, puts the learner's privacy and self-expression on equal footing with institutional demand for proof.\"\nIn an October 2015 post titled \u201cCertificates, Reputation, and the Blockchain\u201d J. Philipp Schmidt, director of Learning Innovation at the MIT Media Lab, explained the lab\u2019s high level thinking about digital certificates, and why they are important.\n\u201c[We] need an open platform for digital certificates and reputation,\u201d said Schmidt. \u201cUsing the blockchain and strong cryptography, it is now possible to create a certification infrastructure that puts us in control of the full record of our achievements and accomplishments. It will allow us to share a digital degree with an employer while giving the employer complete trust that the degree was in fact issued to the person presenting it.\u201d\nA new MIT Media Lab post co-authored by Schmidt, titled \u201cWhat We Learned from Designing an Academic Certificates System on the Blockchain,\u201d provides a detailed explanation of the system\u2019s technical design, implementation and planned evolution. The first version of the code has been released under the MIT open-source license, and is available on Github. The project page at MIT includes links to the source code, documentation and discussion.\u00a0\n\u201cMany of the most interesting challenges we encountered were not technical in nature, but they cannot easily be separated from the technology because small design decisions can fundamentally shape behavior,\u201d notes the MIT post. \u201cThat is why we have taken small experimental steps, tested our system with actual users and continue to make changes based on what we are learning. The blockchain is a relatively new technology and its complexity and immutability make it even more important to carefully consider the long-term effects of design decisions.\u201d\nThe developers emphasize that version 1 of the software is intended as a useful starting point for other researchers and experimental projects. For institutions looking to roll out digital credential systems, the developers recommend waiting for version 2, which will be fundamentally redesigned. Version 2 and future versions will be released under the same MIT open-source license.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the MIT Media Lab has become a central Bitcoin hub and assumed a de facto leadership in Bitcoin technical development, and the digital certificates project is based on the public Bitcoin blockchain (as opposed to Ethereum, a new blockchain, or one of the surviving altcoins).\n\u201cBitcoin has been the most tested and reliable blockchain to date; in addition, the relatively robust self-interest of miners, and the financial investment made into Bitcoin (and Bitcoin-related companies) make it likely that it will be around for a good while longer,\u201d reads the new MIT Media Lab post.", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 8}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin right now is\u00a0not really anonymous. While Bitcoin addresses aren't necessarily linked to real-world identities, they can be. Monitoring the unencrypted peer-to-peer network, analysis of the public blockchain, and Know Your Customer (KYC) policy or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulation can reveal a lot about who's using Bitcoin, and for what.\nThis is not great from a privacy perspective. Bitcoin users might not necessarily want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own, while businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors \u2013 to name some examples.\nAdditionally, bitcoins being traceable, possibly \u201ctainted,\u201d and potentially worth less than other bitcoins is at odds with fungibility. This could even challenge Bitcoin's value proposition as money.\nBut there are potential solutions to increase privacy, and improve fungibility.\nOne of these solutions is\u00a0BIP 151, a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal designed to encrypt data among Bitcoin nodes.\nThe Problem\nTraffic over the Bitcoin network has always been unencrypted. Transactions and blocks are sent from node to node in plain sight, as are Bloom filters, which are often used by Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) nodes. All this data can, therefore, be seen by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), open-WiFi providers and anyone monitoring the Bitcoin network.\nThis has obvious downsides. In the case of full nodes (and miners), information on where transactions and blocks originate can link Bitcoin addresses to IP addresses, which can be used to de-anonymize users. Moreover, ISPs and open-WiFi providers can potentially use the data to block certain transactions, for instance if they send bitcoins to a blacklisted address.\nMost SPV-wallets (or lightweight clients \u2013 and in particular those based on the Bitcoinj-library) have an additional problem. To check funds, these wallets send out so-called Bloom filters, a mathematical trick that aggregates data into a compact package. Unfortunately, this has proved\u00a0insecure from a privacy perspective: The packages can be used to reconstruct which Bitcoin-addresses belong to the wallet-user.\nWhile there are some solutions available to encrypt data between nodes already, most obviously Tor and VPN, these are not ideal. For one, these solutions don't work \u201cout-of-the-box\u201d \u2012 they require extra software and sometimes special ports. Second, users typically need to rely on infrastructure and people outside of the Bitcoin system (and in particular Tor exit nodes). And there's typically a hit to performance as well.\nThe Solution\nBIP 151, designed and recently proposed by Bitcoin Core developer Jonas Schnelli, is a straightforward solution: It encrypts traffic between nodes.\nTo avoid potential security risks posed by the much more common TLS/SSL cryptographic standard, BIP 151 proposes to use a cryptographic standard known as \u201cChaCha20/Poly1305@openssh.\u201d This standard is already used by OpenSSH and the Google-API, among other projects, and is generally considered well-proved. It offers the added advantage of speeding up network traffic; Bitcoin messages currently include a SHA256-hash (another cryptographic standard) of the content, which is relatively \u201cheavy\u201d to compute.\nWith ChaCha20/Poly1305@openssh, anyone monitoring the network could still recognize packages as Bitcoin data. But they would not know the content of the data. This automatically improves privacy. Additionally, it becomes harder to censor specific transactions or blocks: ISPs or open-WiFi providers can only censor all\u00a0Bitcoin-data, or none\u00a0of it.\nRealization\nWhile BIP 151 was proposed quite recently, and the review process has just started, there is as of yet little reason to think it can't be safely deployed on the Bitcoin network.\nIn fact, since BIP 151 has no impact on Bitcoin's consensus layer, any miner, node or wallet on the network can opt in to the solution at any time \u2013 even if some other miners, nodes or wallet don't. (If one or both connected nodes don\u2019t apply BIP 151, the data is simply transmitted in plain text \u2013 which does, of course, mean the privacy and censorship-resistant benefits don\u2019t hold up either.)\nHowever, the solution might not be completely airtight. It could, at least in theory, be possible, for example, to analyze the encrypted data and conclude how big the message is. Comparing this with the data as it appears in mempools or on the blockchain might reveal which data was sent from a specific node. But all in all, this problem is probably negligible \u2013 and it would still be impossible to censor specific content pro-actively.\nAnd, of course, BIP 151 doesn't in itself make Bitcoin private or fungible; it's a mere part of the puzzle. Perhaps the most relevant improvement to be rolled out alongside BIP 151 is a solution for node authentication to ensure a connected peer is a genuine node, not an ISP or WiFi-provider disguised as one. Schnelli is currently working on a solution to ensure node authentication as well.\nDisclaimer: The author of this piece is not a cryptographer, and had to rely on information on this subject from sources who are more knowledgeable.", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 8}

ESMA is seeking feedback on the possible use of DLT in securities markets, including potential benefits and risks.\nThe Telegraph notes that shares could eventually be traded almost instantly without the costly safety net of clearing houses by using the blockchain, the building blocks of Bitcoin, although the technology remains at an early stage. While DLT was first deployed to run the Bitcoin network, it could be adopted to streamline securities trading.\nESMA began analyzing virtual currencies in 2013 and then analyzed investments using virtual currencies or DLT, including possible risks and benefits, on which ESMA is now seeking more in-depth feedback to further its assessment.\u00a0\nThe public \u201cConsultation on the Distributed Ledger Technology Applied to Securities Markets\u201d runs from June 2 to September 2, 2016. Stakeholders and other interested parties are invited to respond to the questions stated in the discussion paper and describe alternatives that ESMA should consider. In particular, the ESMA is seeking feedback and opinions from fintech companies and financial institutions interested in the use of DLT in securities markets such as banks, central counterparties, central securities depositaries, custodians, asset managers and investors.\u00a0\nTwo of the key questions asked, which seem especially representative as indication of ESMA\u2019s targets, are, \u201cIf you are working on a concrete application of the DLT to securities markets please describe it (i.e., which activities, which market segments, which type of assets and for which expected benefits) and explain where you stand in terms of practical achievements in relation to your objectives,\u201d and \u201cDo you see potential regulatory impediments to the deployment of the DLT in securities markets?\u201d\nESMA will use the feedback provided by the participants in the consultation to develop a position on the use of DLT in securities markets and, in particular, to assess whether a regulatory response may be needed.\nESMA appreciates that DLT may have different applications and impacts on financial activities, market participants and market infrastructures, depending on a variety of elements, including its capacity to address a number of technical, governance, legal and regulatory issues. A disclaimer notes that it\u2019s too early to form a definitive official position on DLT. With the publication of the discussion paper, the authority does not intend to express a firm position on the DLT, but rather present \u201cin a factual and objective manner\u201d the results of its preliminary analysis on the possible impacts of the DLT on securities markets.\nAccording to the authority\u2019s preliminary analysis, DLT could ultimately become the trusted source for the record of ownership of securities and safekeeping of assets. It could speed the clearing and settlement of certain financial transactions, by reducing the number of intermediaries involved and by making the reconciliation process more efficient. Additional benefits could come from the possibility of combining clearing and settlement of transactions into a single step, which would be almost instantaneous.\nDLT could also facilitate the recording of ownership of a variety of securities and the safekeeping of assets, the implementation of a unique reference system across securities markets, and the collection, consolidation and sharing of data for reporting, risk management and supervisory purposes.\nIn a reference to emerging trends in DLT, the ESMA notes that smart contracts implemented on top of distributed ledgers could increase automation and reduce uncertainty and risk. In another interesting statement inspired by an emerging trend, pioneered, among others, by Overstock, the authority notes that \u201cDLT could also be used to directly issue digital securities and track their ownership and help supporting issuance related services.\u201d\nTwo important arguments in favor of DLT are security and cost. The document notes that the perceived high security of DLT \u2012 which according to the authority \u201cremains to be tested\u201d \u2012 is due to the distributed nature of the ledger, which doesn\u2019t present a single point of attack, and the use of cryptography and consensus to secure and validate transactions. \u201cThese features could help mitigate the risk of a cyber-attack,\u201d notes the authority. \u201cThey could also reduce the need for recovery plans, since the records would be kept in several places at the same time.\u201d A general reduction of costs is another suggested benefit of DLT.\nAmong the perceived shortcomings of existing DLT mentioned in the paper, scalability and interoperability have a central role, and risks are thoroughly analyzed. It\u2019s worth noting that the authority clearly favors \u201cpermissioned\u201d ledgers over the \u00a0\u201cpermissionless\u201d model used in the Bitcoin network, where everyone \u2012 including non-vetted anonymous participants \u2012 can operate a network node and validate transactions.\nThe ESMA document notes that the capacity of DLT to fit into the existing regulatory framework may limit its deployment, and analyzes the key E.U. regulations likely to apply, and what requirement they would impose on the participants in DLT networks.", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 9}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe Lightning Network is the probably most highly anticipated technological innovation to be deployed on top of Bitcoin. The payment layer, first proposed by Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja about a year ago, promises to support a virtually unlimited number of off-chain transactions among users, at nearly no cost \u2013 while leveraging the security offered by Bitcoin.\nAt least three companies \u2013 Poon and Dryja's\u00a0Lightning,\u00a0Blockstream and\u00a0Blockchain \u2013 are currently working on implementations of the technology. But few outside this small technological frontline fully grasp how the \u201cfuture of micropayments\u201d is set to boost Bitcoin\u2019s capabilities.\nIn this three-part series,\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine\u00a0lays out the basic building blocks of the Lightning Network, and shows how they fit together to realize this upcoming protocol layer.\nThe first part of this series covered basic building blocks, and explained how these are used to establish bidirectional payment channels. This second part explains how bidirectional payment channels are turned into a network.\nThe Network\nIn the previous article, Alice and Bob established a bidirectional payment channel. Now, Alice wants to pay one bitcoin to a third person, Carol.\nTo do so, Alice and Carol could open up a payment channel between them. But they don't actually need to. As it turns out, Bob and Carol already have a mutual channel, so Alice can simply pay Carol through Bob.\nSpecifically, Alice can pay Bob one bitcoin, and Bob can pay Carol one bitcoin.\nHowever, Alice doesn't really trust Bob \u2013 or Carol for that matter. She's afraid that if she pays Bob, Bob will never actually pay Carol. Or perhaps Bob will pay Carol, but Carol will claim she never received the money, and Alice wouldn't know whom to blame.\nAlice, therefore, wants to ensure that she only pays Bob one bitcoin, if\u00a0he also pays Carol one bitcoin. This is accomplished (in part) with a simple cryptographic trick.\nWhen Alice wants to send Carol a bitcoin, she tells Carol to create a value (a random string of numbers) and send her the hash. Alice also tells Carol to exchange the original value with Bob for a bitcoin.\nAlice, meanwhile, takes the hash from Carol, turns to Bob, and tells Bob she will give him a bitcoin if he provides her the corresponding value (which only Carol has).\u00a0\nSo, Bob turns to Carol, and gives Carol one bitcoin in return for the value.\nThen, Bob turns back to Alice with the value. Alice knows Bob must have gotten the value from Carol in exchange for a bitcoin, and therefore concludes Carol got her bitcoin. So Alice can confidently give Bob a bitcoin.\nEverybody is happy.\n\nWell. .. almost\u00a0everybody is happy.\nIn this \u201cnaive\u201d scenario, middleman Bob still has to trust Alice and Carol. Bob has to trust Carol to really give him the value after he sent her a bitcoin, and Bob has to trust Alice to really give him a bitcoin once he presents her the value.\nThe bitcoin-for-value trades must therefore be absolutely guaranteed along the network. More specifically: if Bob gives a bitcoin to Carol, he must be guaranteed to get a bitcoin back from Alice.\nThat's where Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) come in.\nHash Time-Locked Contracts\nSo Alice and Bob want to exchange a bitcoin for the value through an HTLC. (And Bob and Carol also want to a bitcoin exchange for that same value - but never mind that for now.)\nTo do so, rather than sending Bob a bitcoin straight up, Alice sends a bitcoin to a new (and, again: funky) multisig address. The bitcoins locked up on this address can be unlocked in two different ways.\nThe first option is for Bob to include his signature and\u00a0the value.\nThe second option is for Alice to include her own signature. However, this option has a CLTV-timelock on it: Alice can sign and broadcast the transaction only after \u2013 say \u2013 two weeks have gone by.\nThis means that Bob has two weeks to create a subsequent transaction in which he includes his signature and the value, and broadcast it to send the bitcoin from the funky multisig address to himself. As such, this trade is guaranteed. Bob can only claim Alice's bitcoin if he provides the value: broadcasting it over the Bitcoin network makes it publicly visible for Alice to see.\nAnd if Bob doesn\u2019t provide the value in time, there is a \u201ctime-out alternative\u201d for Alice to get her bitcoin back.\nSimple.\n\nBack to the network, as that\u2019s really why this HTLC setup is needed.\u00a0\nAs mentioned, not only Alice and Bob, but also Bob and Carol established an HTLC. So, if\u00a0Carol claims her bitcoin from Bob, Bob will\u00a0get the value in return; it will be visible on the blockchain.\nTherefore, if\u00a0that happens, Bob is guaranteed to get a bitcoin from Alice as well. Bob can take the value that Carol made publicly visible on the blockchain, include it in his HTLC with Alice, and claim a bitcoin for himself, too. The two channels are effectively linked.\nAs a final detail, it is\u00a0important that Bob gets the value from Carol before\u00a0Alice can reclaim her bitcoin from Bob. If Bob gets the value from Carol only after\u00a0Alice already reclaimed hers back, Bob is stuck in the middle after all. The time-out in Bob and Carol\u2019s HTLC must therefore expire before\u00a0the time-out in Alice and Bob\u2019s HTLC expires. (For example after exactly ten days, instead of two weeks. This is also why HTLCs need CheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV)--and not CheckSequenceVerify (CSV).)\n\nLastly, there's one more problem to solve: for the Lightning Network to be useful, all this must be accomplished off-chain. How this is done, is covered in the third and final article of this series.", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 7}

As a result, the normally conservative crowd may have been freer to explore the possibilities of a whole new way of looking at money and finances.\nBitcoin Luminaries Shine Light on New Technologies for Conference Participants\nIn a keynote address, Ludwin told central bankers they will issue national currencies in digital form in the near future. He cited many reasons for this shift, including:\n1. Banking and finance are next up to digitalize and globalize, just as music, publishing and communications sectors have grown and benefitted from new technologies. He noted that soon, the phrase \u201ccross-border payment\u201d will make about as much sense as \u201ccross-border email.\u201d\n2. Bitcoin is into its seventh year and is still showing robust resilience and steady growth as the volume of transactions, increasing steadily, is now at 250,000 a day.\n3. Multisig and other technologies provide more robust security than traditional banknotes and systems, and more flexibility than current centralized systems.\n4. The efficiencies and cost savings of these new technologies will be the strongest reason to digitalize. (At this point in the presentation Ludwin brought out his phone and sent a Bitcoin donation to Wikipedia in one easy step \u2013 likely the first Bitcoin donation sent from the Federal Reserve.)\n5. Other financial institutions are already building new networks to digitalize assets such as securities and currencies, so they can move more efficiently and securely.\n6. Central banks will want to be in a better position to influence liquidity in the increasingly important capital markets that operate outside of depository institutions.\nLudwin went on to note that ultimately, blockchain networks will lead to a safer and better payments system. And central bank digital currency will be the foundation of that system.\nBloq\u2019s Garzik stressed that the greatest advantages of digital currencies will be seen first in the developing world. \u201cSome of the greatest potential benefits of blockchain technology are going to be first seen and actively leveraged in emerging nations,\u201d he said.\nGarzik told the conference that the innovative elements of blockchain technology, including trust shifting, decentralization, cryptography and immutability will guarantee its future success in the banking and financial sectors.\nBoring, of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, encouraged the Federal Reserve and central banks to focus on and embrace innovation in blockchain and distributed ledger technology.\u00a0\n\u201cWe believe blockchain technologies are capable of providing the Fed and other regulators with next-generation tools to fulfill their mission of monitoring the safety and soundness of the financial system more effectively,\u201d Boring told American Banker.\nCentral Banks Already Have Begun the Process of Exploring Blockchain Technology\nAs has been previously covered by Bitcoin Magazine, the Federal Reserve and the People\u2019s Bank of China have both been active in studying the emergence of digital currencies .On February 3, David Andolfatto, Vice President of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, wrote a blog post based on a presentation he gave at the International Workshop on P2P Financial Systems 2015. The title of the blog post is \u201cFedcoin: On the Desirability of a Government Cryptocurrency.\u201d\nPerhaps the most surprising thing is that an inherently conservative financial sector \u2012 particularly central banks \u2012 have responded so positively to blockchain technology in such a historically short period of time.\nOther speakers at the three-day conference included:\n\nFredrik Voss, Vice President of Blockchain Innovation, NASDAQ\nTom Jessop, Managing Director of Technology Business Development, Goldman Sachs\nAlan McIntyre, Senior Managing Director of Global Banking, Accenture\nHollis Hart, President, Citi International Franchise Management\nCarolyn Wilkins, Senior Deputy Governor, Bank of Canada\nFritz Zurbr\u00fcgg, Vice-Chairman of the Governing Board, Swiss National Bank\nSheila M\u2019Mbijjewe, Deputy Governor, Central Bank of Kenya\nLorenza Mart\u00ednez Trigueros, Director General of Payment Systems and Corporate Services, Banco de M\u00e9xico\nKonstantin Peric, Deputy Director of Financial Services for the Poor, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation\nShamina Singh, Executive Director, MasterCard Center for Inclusive Growth\nAlejandro Picos, Vice President, PayPal\nMin Liao, Director-General, China Banking Regulatory Commission, Shanghai Office\n\n\u00a0\nPhoto AgnosticPreachersKid / Creative Commons", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 9}

It will also support any tokens that Jaxx and ShapeShift integrate in the future.\n\u201cJaxx and ShapeShift together will, without doubt, be the easiest solution for buying ether with bitcoin (and vice versa) \u2012 and it\u2019s done right in your Jaxx wallet!\u201d said Anthony Di Iorio, CEO and founder of Jaxx and Decentral. \u00a0\nAccording to Erik Voorhees, founder and CEO of ShapeShift, ShapeShift\u2019s API was designed with the purpose of making cross-cryptocurrency conversions easier.\u00a0\n\u201cWe built ShapeShift's API for this very reason \u2014 to enable other services in this ecosystem to leverage it for the benefit of their users,\u201d Voorhees said. Converting blockchain assets should be as easy as clicking a button, and Jaxx's integration of ShapeShift demonstrates this principle.\u201d\nHow It Works\u00a0\nExplaining how the process works in a blog post, Di Iorio said that to start a conversion users first need to select their Bitcoin wallet and open the \u201csend\u201d tab, select the ShapeShift icon and enter the bitcoin amount they would like to shift, then confirm the transaction. Ether will show up in their Ethereum wallet when the transaction is completed.\nThe process for buying bitcoin with ether or DAO is the same. Users just need to start with their Ethereum or DAO wallet instead. The Jaxx wallet also displays the current conversion rate and minimum/maximum deposit amounts for the shift.\n\u201cThis method is far simpler than going to the ShapeShift site, as you don\u2019t need to enter deposit or return addresses. It all gets automatically done in Jaxx using your built-in Bitcoin and Ether wallets,\u201d Di Iorio said.\u00a0\nSpeaking on the partnership with ShapeShift, Di Iorio said that the integration of ShapeShift\u2019s API with the Jaxx wallet will help the company in realizing its vision of becoming the industry\u2019s default blockchain wallet.\n\u201cThe Jaxx\u00ad ShapeShift integration is one of many partnerships we anticipate with companies around the world,\u201d Di Iorio said. \u201cWe believe our single code base and the ability to deploy in minutes across all platforms and devices gives us a huge advantage towards becoming the industry\u2019s default blockchain wallet.\u201d\nAs of now, interoperable versions of Jaxx are available on nine major platforms.

Surprisingly, only 12 percent said they currently have any kind of deployments in blockchain, while 88 percent are either in research and development or are doing nothing.\nWhen asked what the main hurdles to blockchain adoption were, by a margin of two-to-one the answer was: unclear legal and regulatory issues.\n\u201cLegal and regulatory teams need to be involved in the innovation process from day one, so they can see the practice application of blockchain in their business, and not treat it as rubber-stamping departments late in the process,\u201d said Husain. \u201cThere is no hidden complexity with blockchain, and so complete transparency and a focus on practical application of the technology is key.\u201d\nSlightly higher than the results for blockchain technology, 71 percent of respondents think that over the next 10 years, AI will have a major impact on financial services. The results found, however, that 37 percent said that there is no activity at their institution; 34 percent said AI was in the R&D; stage; 25 percent have small deployments; and only 3.5 percent have actively deployed AI.\nDespite the fact that AI is becoming a real presence in our day-to-day lives, such as driving our cars and helping us to shop, 40 percent of respondents said that the cost to develop and deploy AI technology was the biggest barrier to adoption.\n\u201cFinancial services are built on huge stacks of data, and so there is huge potential value in using AI to garner insights, predict patterns and help make decisions,\u201d said Husain. \u201cIt has already become clear that by embracing AI, businesses can achieve a substantial advantage over their competitors and eat market share.\u201d\nNot only that, but systemic operations can become more streamlined, automated and cost-effective, and more can be done to drive new revenue lines using predictive and behavioral pattern recognition.\n\u201cWith the recent convergence of several technology advances like unstructured data analytics, natural language programming, machine learning and low latency processing, it is now more viable that AI can go mainstream and not require huge investments to deliver an ROI [return on investment],\u201d said Husain.\nEven though blockchain\u2019s apparent limitless potential has been making a major impact in recent years, like any technology, its suitability must be assessed by banks in terms of their particular needs.\n\u201cHow important was it in 1995 for companies to start thinking about the impact of the internet on their business?\u201d said Husain. \u201cLike the internet and cloud, blockchains are another enabler of platformification for the financial services industry.\u201d\nHusain adds that because distributed ledger principles are now well understood, industry thought leaders agree that they will fundamentally change the way in which trust-based transactions occur.\n\u201cIt is imperative that financial institutions start implementing and experimenting with the technology as it could prove critical to their competitive status in the future,\u201d he said.\nBlockchain and AI are hugely exciting technologies that are beginning to find real-world uses. The aim of the survey was to specifically identify how blockchain and AI can be applied efficiently within financial services firms.\n\u201cBy increasing awareness of these and encouraging discussion, Synechron can help to move the conversation forward and find practice applications for innovation in financial services,\u201d said Husain.", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 10}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin right now is\u00a0 not really anonymous. While Bitcoin addresses aren't necessarily linked to real-world identities, they can be. And it\u2019s possible to learn a lot about who\u2019s using Bitcoin, and for what, by monitoring the unencrypted peer-to-peer network or analysis of the public blockchain, as well as through Know Your Customer (KYC) or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations.\nThis is not great from a privacy perspective. Bitcoin users might not necessarily want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own, while businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors \u2013 to name just a few examples.\nAdditionally, selected bitcoins being traceable, possibly \u201ctainted\u201d and potentially worth less than other bitcoins is at odds with\u00a0 fungibility. These privacy-related issues could even challenge Bitcoin's value proposition as money.\nBut there are potential solutions to increase privacy and improve fungibility.\nOne of the oldest tricks in the book is coin mixing. More recently, this trick was dusted off, improved and re-introduced in the form of \u201ccoin shuffle\u201d protocols.\nTraditional Mixing\nThe concept of mixing coins is not too complicated.\nIf two or more people wish to obfuscate the trails of the coins they control, they can simply exchange their coins with one another. Each participant of such an exchange will end up controlling coins with a history that's not theirs, while ridding themselves of any coins that do reflect their own activity.\nThe most straightforward way to mix coins is for users to simply connect, for instance on an internet forum, and agree to send each other specific amounts of coins. However, this option has obvious downsides. Not only must two or more users wish to exchange coins at more or less the same time (and be able to find each other) \u2012 they must also trust each other not to run off with coins after receiving them.\nAlternatively, users can mix coins through a dedicated mixer, typically hosted on a central server. This concept is straightforward, too: users send coins to the mixer, and the mixer sends different coins back \u2013 usually minus a mixing fee. Several of these mixers already exist, such as\u00a0 bitmixer.io. Some dark net markets use built-in mixers, too.\nUnfortunately, centralized mixers suffer from obvious weaknesses. For one, the counterparty risk still exists: Whoever controls the mixer must be trusted to actually send bitcoins back. Meanwhile, the privacy and fungibility problem is not entirely solved either: Whoever controls the mixer knows exactly which coins were exchanged for which coins, and can therefore re-establish the trail.\nThere\u2019s an alternate solution in CoinJoin. CoinJoin allows users to obfuscate their Bitcoin trails to the outside world by essentially combining several transactions into a single big transaction. This makes it unclear which addresses sent bitcoins to which addresses since all \u201cto\u201d and \u201cfrom\u201d addresses are lumped together.\nBut with CoinJoin, trails are not necessarily obfuscated for all participants in the transaction. After all, in order to create a CoinJoin transaction, (some) participants must be able to see which addresses are sending bitcoins to which addresses.\nThis is the problem CoinShuffle protocols solve.\nCoinShuffle\nCoinShuffle was a major breakthrough when it was first proposed by researchers from Saarland University in 2014, because it had the potential to decentralize mixing to the extent that no one needed to trust anyone else.\nAs with typical CoinJoin transactions, CoinShuffle allows different users to submit output addresses to be included into a single transaction in order to obfuscate trails.\nThe innovation introduced by CoinShuffle is that users can submit an output address, without revealing to anyone else which specific address they submitted. As a result, all participants will know which addresses are receiving bitcoins \u2013 but no one will know from which addresses these bitcoins are sent.\nThis is achieved through a clever protocol.\nIn short, all participants generate a unique public key (a random string of numbers) with which others can encrypt data, and a corresponding private key with which they themselves can decrypt it. Along a predetermined (and random) order, all participants pass their public keys around, in such a way that one user ends up with all public keys, one user ends up with all-but-one, all the way down to the user who actually got none of them.\nThe user who got all of the public keys then encrypts his output address with all of the public keys, one for one, in the right sequence. These are layers of encryption that can only be decrypted with all the private keys, one by one, in the right order. This package is handed to the next user, who has all the public keys except for one.\nThis user decrypts this package with his own private key; he \u201cpeels\u201d one layer of the encryption-onion, but still can't tell which output address is \u201chidden underneath.\u201d Additionally, he encrypts his own output address with all the public keys (but one), and passes both encrypted packages on to the next user.\nThis next user has no idea which package originally came from which user. But he can peel another encryption layer off of both. And, of course, he can encrypt his own output address with all public keys that he got, and pass three encrypted packages on to the next.\nThis goes on until the very last user, who gets packages containing all the other output addresses, encrypted. But at this point, all the packages have only one layer of encryption left; and this last user can decrypt all of them at once. He then adds his own output address into the mix, constructs one big CoinJoin transaction, and sends it back to all participants to sign.\nAt this point, all participants can simply verify that their output addresses are \u00a0included in the transaction, sign it and broadcast the transaction. (It doesn't really matter who broadcasts, exactly.) No one will ever know who provided which output address.\nThe much-used\u00a0 Mycelium Bitcoin wallet might soon include an implementation of the CoinShuffle protocol, that Mycelium has named\u00a0 Shufflepuff.\nCoinShuffle++\nWhile CoinShuffle works as intended, the protocol requires a significant number of steps to complete, which makes it somewhat impractical for day-to-day use. The same researchers from Saarland University, therefore, more recently proposed an improved solution:\u00a0 CoinShuffle++. CoinShuffle++ essentially does what CoinShuffle does, but faster and better.\nWhere participants in CoinShuffle generate public and private key pairs, participants in a CoinShuffle++ transaction create \u201cmutual secrets\u201d \u2012 also unique strings of numbers. Each participant shares such a string with every other participant, but each shared secret is shared only among two of them; no more, no less.\nAll participants then \u201cmask\u201d their own output using all the secrets they share. But importantly, these shared secrets are used as both negative values as well as positive values for each pair of participants. (If one participant masks his output with the shared secret 12345, the other participant masks his output with -12345.)\nThis allows for a nifty trick, as descibed in the Dining cryptographers problem. Once all participants share their masked outputs, they can combine these in such a way that all shared secrets cancel each other out. What's left, at that point, is the grand combination of all outputs \u2013 unmasked.\nThe next challenge is to extract the specific outputs from the combination of all outputs. That's where another mathematical trick comes into play: so-called\u00a0 Newton Identities. The technical details of this trick are unfortunately beyond the scope of this article, as it wanders far into the complexity of advanced mathematics. But it is essentially accomplished using several different redundant encodings of the message, which participants can apply to locally extract all the original output addresses \u2013 without knowing who provided which address.\nAnd importantly, this can be done in a single go, to make it much faster and more efficient than the original CoinShuffle protocol. According to the Saarland University researchers, up to 50 participants may complete the CoinShuffle++ protocol in about 15 seconds; potentially even fast enough for typical point-of-sale situations.\nTrade-Offs and Weaknesses\nLike most other anonymizing solutions, CoinShuffle protocols improve privacy and fungibility. But they are insufficient to provide full anonymity and fungibility in and of themselves \u2013 nor are they free from any weakness.\nAs one drawback of both CoinShuffle protocols, they can be frustrated by dishonest participants. If even just one of the participants wants to block a successful \u201cshuffle\u201d he can insert \u201cfake\u201d (encrypted) data in the process (or not partake in his part of the process at all).\nIt is, however, possible to trace the participant trying to frustrate the protocol. As such, the protocol can trivially be restarted without this specific participant. This increases the total time for all mixing, but mixing will complete.\nAdditionally, many of the weaknesses that pertain to typical CoinJoin transactions hold up for shuffle protocols as well. Most important, if the different amounts sent in the collective transaction aren't equal, it might be possible to figure out which inputs and outputs correspond \u2013 defeating the purpose entirely.\nLikewise, if all of the \u201cparticipants\u201d are really one and the same entity pretending to be several \u2013 a\u00a0 Sybil attack \u2013 no amount of mixing will make any difference: that one entity can simply connect the only inputs and outputs that aren't his.\nDetails on CoinShuffle++ are explained in detail in the \u00a0CoinShuffle++ white paper.\nThanks to CoinShuffle++ inventors Pedro Moreno-Sanchez and Tim Ruffing, and Mycelium\u2019s Daniel Krawisz for info and feedback.\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 14}

The council has about 40 members from different industries, partnering in blockchain technology advocacy and experiments. There is a working party and an executive group, which are roughly the same, but differ in the frequency of meetings.\nThe council has been established to develop innovative solutions and next-generation services for smart cities, help the UAE authorities and corporations understand the potential and the regulatory implications of distributed ledgers and to run pilot projects.\n\u201cThe Global Blockchain Council will launch different initiatives under its umbrella to highlight and promote Blockchain and digital currencies, and explore its advantages and disadvantages,\u201d said Saif Al Aleeli, Chief Executive Officer of Dubai Museum of the Future Foundation. \u201cIt will also draw a roadmap for best uses of this emerging technology.\u201d Al Aleeli added that, as indicated by several studies, the global market for digital transactions and the global investments in blockchain technology are expected to skyrocket in the next few years.\nIn May, the foundation announced a strategic partnership with the Keynote Conference to host the conference in Dubai on May 30, 2016. At the conference, the Global Blockchain Council launched its first pilot projects in digital financial transactions.\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Moe Levin, founder of Keynote Events, to find out more. Levin, a member of the Global Blockchain Council, created the largest financial technology conference in the Gulf region. He is an entrepreneur and futurist interested in the growth and future of the greatest innovation since the internet \u2012 the blockchain. He also consults for companies globally developing blockchain-related strategy. Prior to founding Keynote Events, Levin was director of European business development at BitPay and ran large Bitcoin conferences in North America.\n\"It shows great initiative from the United Arab Emirates to be spearheading innovation, making these innovations accessible to all, and promoting growth in all emerging sectors,\u201d Levin told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThe route that many governments take is that of skepticism and caution, rather than prototyping and experimentation. The Emirates, then, stands as a reference for other governments on how to approach the future.\"\nAccording to Levin, Dubai and more broadly the Emirates, has the resources and experts needed to extract value out of blockchain technology. As a world center of banking, finance, trade and more, the UAE is in a unique position to be the world leader in this technology. \u201cTheir aim is to research, rapidly prototype and implement if the technology makes sense based on the use case,\u201d explained Levin.\nLevin is enthusiastic about Dubai as a location to establish new blockchain and digital fintech businesses.\n\u201cDubai is an incredible place to establish any business,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cAn international community, world-class international airport and airlines, beautiful beaches and busy financial districts. The corporate tax rate is zero percent, and the speed in which people do business is faster than anywhere in the world.\nBut there are some caveats, he said. Dubai has a small but growing local talent pool which may make it hard to grow locally.\n\u201cThis is trending positively upward but still needs work,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Middle East on the whole has a somewhat more cautious approach to investing than its Silicon Valley counterparts, but offers much more in terms of network. That is, while the rounds might be lower in UAE, the network which investors bring to the table can turn a company profitable faster than anywhere else.\u201d\n\u201cRegulation necessarily needs to follow innovation,\u201d explained Levin. \u201cIt is seldom the case that regulators are also the innovators. However, the regulators in UAE are looking at blockchain fintech and seeing what, if anything, needs oversight. Currently, the pilot projects are simple, and do not impact regulators or regulations in any way. It is my hope that as things develop, the right regulators and regulations will be brought into the room, and will work side by side to develop regulations that do not stifle progress.\u201d\nThe council doesn\u2019t have preconceived positions on current debates in the blockchain sector, such as Bitcoin vs. Ethereum or permissioned vs. permissionless blockchains.\n\u201cI think that everyone on the council is taking a practical \u2018if it works, it works\u2019 approach to blockchain discussions,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is very little politically charged discussion in the group, but rather \u2018how can we prototype this fast and reliably.\u2019 Some projects work on Ethereum, some on Bitcoin, some on Hyperledger, some on custom-built blockchains. What we're trying to do here is prove a concept, not start a philosophical discussion on what is better or worse.\u201d\nThe pilot projects launched at Keynote 2016 are outlined in a review published by CoinDesk. \u201cThese projects will beget more projects,\u201d said Levin. \u201cAfter the conference I was approached by many companies asking for advice, or by other companies telling me that their calendars just became completely full with new projects. These companies are not startups; the companies approaching me and working on pilots have thousands of employees and are world class. I think that some of these pilots will succeed by not trying to be the solution to all things at one time, but rather by trial-and-error and sharing best practices so others can do the same.\u201d\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 14}

We have the ability to change all that.\u201d\nIn fact, the internet was designed with a distributed architecture in mind, but today\u2019s web is centralized, with billions of users dependent on a few central services run by large telecom providers and web giants such as Google, Facebook and Amazon. Today\u2019s web is also fragile, because it relies on centralized distribution models, with servers that come and go. If a server goes down for any technical or commercial reason, or is taken down by the authorities, all the web pages stored on that server disappear. But the internet was designed to be much more robust and resilient than that, and the Decentralized Web initiative can be seen as a return to the visionary \u2012 and technically more advanced \u2012 origins of the internet. Back to the future, indeed.\n\u201cThe web is already decentralized,\u201d said Berners-Lee. \u201cThe problem is the dominance of one search engine, one big social network, one Twitter for microblogging. We don\u2019t have a technology problem; we have a social problem.\u201d\nThe development of decentralized alternatives to the current web has been ongoing for some years, with projects such as IPFS, the Dat Project, WebTorrent, Tahoe-LAFS, Zcash, ZeroNet, BitTorrent, Ethereum, BigchainDB, Blockstack, Interledger, Mediachain, MaidSafe and Storj. The Summit gathered the developers of these and other projects in a first global session, and it is hoped that the media interest due to the prestige of the main participants will accelerate the development and deployment of decentralized web solutions. The Summit\u2019s website has an information page with current projects, reading material and links to the Decentralized Web discussion groups.\nAll summit talks, panels and Q&A; sessions have been video streamed in real time, and the recorded stream is online at the Internet Archive YouTube channel: Day 1, Day 2.\n\u201cI attended the first two days, and the event was inspiring and brilliant,\u201d says Cory Doctorow on BoingBoing. \u201cSpeakers included Vint Cerf, one of the inventors of the core internet technologies; and Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the web.\u201d Doctorow notes that the idea for the summit emerged from Kahle's 2015\u00a0series of talks and articles about networks and protocols that are resistant to attempts to capture, monopolize and control them.\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation website has a full coverage of the Summit\u2019s first day (morning session,\u00a0afternoon session), and more coverage is likely to follow soon.\nThe New York Times article notes that today\u2019s web still runs on relatively old technologies, and online payments are evidence of that. People pay for things online by entering credit card information, not much different from handing a card to a merchant for an imprint. But new payment systems based on distributed ledger technologies could increase individual control over money and permit replacing web ads with micropayment systems.\n\u201cAd revenue is the only model for too many people on the web now,\u201d said Berners-Lee. \u201cImagine a world where paying for things was easy on both sides.\u201d Internet pioneers such as Ted Nelson, Marc Andreessen and Berners-Lee himself thought that\u00a0the internet should have a built-in framework for micropayments. Berners-Lee tried to develop a micropayments system for the web through the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in the \u201890s, but the idea so far hasn\u2019t been implemented.\nRecently\u00a0the W3C restarted its work on an overall web payments architecture and produced initial drafts, which make only incidental mentions of Bitcoin and distributed ledger technologies. However, digital currencies based on distributed ledgers are the only form of internet-native payment system that exists, works and effectively implements one-click payments.\nIt is hoped that the Decentralized Web initiative will be able to move faster than the bureaucratized W3C, and implement micropayment systems based on blockchain technology as part of the new, decentralized web. Besides micropayments, distributed ledgers show potential for other aspects of decentralized web technology. See, for example, Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s coverage of\u00a0Brave,\u00a0IPFS,\u00a0Mediachain,\u00a0Zcash,\u00a0Zeronet,\u00a0new distributed social networks and\u00a0new systems for open science publishing. Of course, many blockchain companies attended the summit.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made real progress today,\u201d said Kahle in his closing address at the end of the first day. \u201cLet\u2019s build a decentralized web.\u201d\nPhoto\u00a0Internet Archive\u00a0/ YouTube", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 10}

One side of the argument, articulated by the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute\u2019s Daniel Krawisz, is that altcoins have no chance of success and distract possible users from Bitcoin, while the other side, articulated by many Ethereum supporters, believe platforms such as Bitcoin and Ethereum can work together.\nJohnny Dilley, who runs strategy at Blockstream, was recently asked for his thoughts on altcoins during an interview on The Crypto Show. Dilley believes the vast majority of altcoins are scams, and he also thinks Bitcoin developers are not threatened by the existence of these alternative cryptocurrencies. The incentive for altcoin speculators to promote uncertainty in the Bitcoin community was also discussed.\nThe Vast Majority of Altcoins Are Scams\nWhen first asked about altcoins, Dilley echoed recent statements made by Monero developer Riccardo Spagni and stated, \u201cI continue to believe that the vast majority of altcoins are scams. They provide no functionality whatsoever, or the functionality they could provide could very easily be implemented via a sidechain.\u201d\nA sidechain is an alternative blockchain to Bitcoin that uses the same Bitcoin currency through a pegging mechanism. The idea is to allow developers to experiment with completely new blockchains without having to bootstrap a new currency network (altcoin). Bitcoin Hivemind and Rootstock are two examples of sidechains currently in development. Blockstream has handled the vast majority of the development work for sidechains up to this point.\nDilley went on to discuss the security concerns associated with altcoins. Critics often point to low network hashrates and alternative consensus models as potential risks of these alternatives to Bitcoin. Dilley added, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to fall back to [a weaker security model], you might as well be piggybacking off Bitcoin via sidechains.\u201d\nBitcoin Developers Not Threatened by Altcoins\nIn terms of whether altcoins are a threat to Bitcoin, Dilley said:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Bitcoin developers \u2012 they\u2019re not doing things from a perceived competitive perspective. Their perspective is: \u2018I have this awesome piece of technology, and I want to be able to help develop it and bring it more into what I think is interesting to build on top of this.\u2019 So no, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s from a perceived threat of any of the altcoins.\u201d\n\nIn the past, many altcoins have marketed themselves with some sort of comparative advantage to Bitcoin. For example, some altcoins have touted faster confirmation times; others claim to offer privacy enhancements. For the most part, Bitcoin developers have focused on implementing their own innovations rather than responding to what\u2019s going on with the altcoin market.\nAlthough Bitcoin developers may not view altcoins as serious threats, Zcash CEO and longtime cypherpunk Zooko Wilcox-O\u2019Hearn recently warned the Bitcoin community to not become too complacent in the push for Bitcoin.\nDoes Uncertainty in Bitcoin Fuel Altcoins?\nThere has been some uncertainty in the Bitcoin market recently due to the ongoing scaling debate. Dilley was asked on The Crypto Show whether he thinks this uncertainty has led to some Bitcoin holders fleeing into altcoins. At first, Dilley responded, \u201cI think there\u2019s some serious, perverse incentives [for altcoin holders to cause uncertainty for Bitcoin], and that\u2019s a broader topic.\u201d\nDilley went on to explain that there are definitely some members of the Bitcoin community who would seize on the opportunity to attack if they saw an opportunity to increase their return on an altcoin speculation. The head of strategy at Blockstream pointed to the large number of scams in the Bitcoin ecosystem over the past few years as a way to explain that there is no shortage of nefarious actors in the space.\nIn addition to altcoin promoters, Mastering Bitcoin author Andreas Antonopoulos has noted the likelihood of attacks from various government agencies. Online Bitcoin discussions have turned into schoolyard-esque yelling matches over the past year, but it\u2019s unclear how much of the divisiveness in the community has been organic. There are plenty of incentives for a variety of different types of non-Bitcoin users to throw gasoline on the fire.", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 20}

Although the hacks were a serious hit to the exchange, CEO Erik Voorhees claims things could have been much worse if the startup had decided to comply with BitLicense regulations in New York.\nTraditional Regulations Won\u2019t Work\nVoorhees was recently on a panel related to disruptive Bitcoin companies at Consensus 2016. OB1 CEO Brian Hoffman, Blockstack Labs co-founder Ryan Shea, and Lightning CEO Elizabeth Stark were also featured on the panel. The panel was moderated by Chamber of Digital Commerce President Perianne Boring.\nThe topic of regulation came up on multiple occasions during the panel discussion, and Voorhees, a vocal critic of various forms of Bitcoin-related regulations, did not hold back in sharing his contempt for the various legal restrictions that have been placed on Bitcoin (especially the New York BitLicense).\nVoorhees made the point that traditional regulations \u2012 when applied to Bitcoin or other blockchains \u2012 are like fitting a \u201csquare peg into a round hole.\u201d Voorhees said that placing restrictions on the development of this new financial technology would be akin to requiring bloggers to get some sort of publishing license in the early days of the Internet.\nWhy BitLicense Would Have Made the ShapeShift Hack Worse\nVoorhees also used the multiple hacks and thefts he\u2019s recently had to deal with to make a point about how traditional regulations should not be applied to Bitcoin. In regard to the hacks, Voorhees stated:\n\u201cYou can bet that if we had, for example, followed the New York Bitlicense and were taking personal, private information of every single customer that was on our website, all of that personal and private information would now be in the hands of the hacker [and] all over the dark web.\u201d\nVoorhees has been extremely transparent with everything that has happened in relation to the hacks. He wrote a full report of events, talked about it on the Bitcoin.com podcast, and answered further questions for Epicenter Bitcoin.\nThe Blockchain Offers True Consumer Protection\nOne of the reasons Voorhees has a disdain for the BitLicense is that, in his view, it makes consumers less safe. For example, ShapeShift does not have to collect practically any information related to their customers because crypto tokens work like digital cash.\nThe fact that ShapeShift does not have to collect information or funds from their customers removes a liability from the exchange\u2019s side and increases security for users.\u00a0\n\u201cTo me, that is true consumer protection through design, and that\u2019s one of the magic things that blockchains allow,\u201d Voorhees added.\nNew York is the only jurisdiction in the entire world blocked by ShapeShift. In this particular case, it appears that ShapeShift made the correct decision from a consumer protection perspective.", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 18}
{"title": "Features From the Most Popular Altcoins Are Planned for Bitcoin", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/features-from-the-most-popular-altcoins-are-planned-for-bitcoin-1463675591/", "birthday": "May 19, 2016  12:33 PM EST", "date": "2016-05-19 17:33:00", "content": "Kyle Torpey is a freelance writer and researcher who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nFor many people involved with Bitcoin, altcoins are nothing more than testnets. Hundreds of digital currencies are currently listed on CoinCap.io, but Bitcoin still dominates 78 percent of the market. In total, there are only 10 digital currencies with a current market cap of $10 million or more.\nWhen looking at the most popular altcoins, it\u2019s easy to see that there are some cryptocurrency features that are more desirable than others. Many have said that any altcoin with useful features will eventually see those features incorporated into Bitcoin. Up to this point, it\u2019s clear that many of the most popular altcoins contain features that are similar to new improvements that are planned for Bitcoin.\nIt should be noted that Ripple will not be included in this list as it fits the archetype of a permissioned ledger more than an open, permissionless blockchain.\nEthereum\nEthereum is the most successful altcoin in the history of digital currency \u2012 at least when measured as a percentage of Bitcoin\u2019s overall market cap. It was the second altcoin to ever reach a $1 billion market cap (after Litecoin).\nThe main selling point of Ethereum is that it is a platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications. These sorts of applications have long been talked about as a sort of \u201cBitcoin 2.0.\u201d\nBitcoin Alternatives:\u00a0There are a variety of ways in which Ethereum-esque applications could make their way to Bitcoin:\n\nRootstock is a smart contract platform with similar goals to Ethereum. In fact, it is partially based on the combination of the Bitcoinj and Ethereumj clients. RSK Labs intends to implement the Rootstock project as a sidechain to Bitcoin; this means, while operating on a separate blockchain, Rootstock would exist in the Bitcoin currency network.\nSegregated Witness enables many new improvements to Bitcoin. One such improvement is the ability to more easily upgrade Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language. At this year\u2019s MIT Bitcoin Expo, Blockstream Core Tech Engineer Mark Friedenbach stated, \u201cWe could do something like Ethereum script, which is drastically different from Bitcoin script.\u201d It should be noted that there currently do not appear to be any concrete plans to bring Ethereum script to Bitcoin via this method.\nSome Ethereum-based applications can also make their way to Bitcoin on their own. In this sense, a specific application is enabled on Bitcoin rather than the entire Ethereum platform. The best example here is Bitcoin Hivemind. This project is the brainchild of former Yale statistician Paul Sztorc, and it\u2019s a blockchain-based prediction market. A similar project, Augur (also mostly based on Sztorc\u2019s work but without his support), is one of Ethereum\u2019s most highly anticipated applications.\nIt\u2019s possible that many of Ethereum\u2019s use cases can also be implemented on Bitcoin via multisig. This has been former Bitcoin Core lead maintainer Gavin Andresen\u2019s stance on Ethereum for quite some time. In a recent AMA on Chinese Bitcoin community website 8btc, Andresen stated, \u201cI think most of the interesting things you can do with Ethereum you can also do with multi-signature Bitcoin transactions.\u201d\n\nIt should be noted that the use of Bitcoin on Ethereum was also recently enabled via BTC Relay.\nDogecoin and Litecoin\nDogecoin and Litecoin are two different digital currencies that are mostly used for low-value, low-security transactions. According to CoinGecko, these are the two most popular altcoins besides Ethereum. Although the Litecoin market cap was once over $1 billion, it currently sits below $200 million.\nBitcoin Alternatives:\u00a0Sidechains and layer-2 protocols, such as the Lightning Network, are Bitcoin\u2019s main alternatives to Dogecoin and Litecoin \u2012 at least in terms of low-security, cheap alternatives to the Bitcoin blockchain. Of course, it should be noted that there may not be much of a security tradeoff in the case of the Lightning Network. These are still Bitcoin transactions.\nBlockstream CTO Greg Maxwell and Bloq co-founder Jeff Garzik recently shared countering viewpoints (here for Maxwell and here for Garzik) on which solution will work best for Bitcoin. It would be impossible for Bitcoin to replace Litecoin as the \u201csilver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold,\u201d but this is more of a marketing term than anything involving an actual use case.\nDash and Monero\nAlthough they have different communities and features, the main selling point for both Dash and Monero is better privacy. Dash is currently the more popular altcoin on the market, although Bitcoin Core contributor and security researcher Peter Todd has publicly noted his preference for Monero. These two altcoins could face increased competition from the upcoming launch of Zcash.\nBitcoin Alternatives:\u00a0Better privacy has been a topic of conversation in the Bitcoin community for a long time. Implementing CoinJoin in Bitcoin Core has been discussed on the GitHub repository since 2013, although the conversation has gained new life in recent months \u2012 in large part thanks to JoinMarket.\nConfidential Transactions is a proposal that would greatly improve the level of privacy in Bitcoin transactions by encrypting the amounts involved.\nIt\u2019s possible that something like Confidential Transactions could be tested on a sidechain before being implemented on the main Bitcoin blockchain. This feature is already available on Blockstream\u2019s Elements Alpha testnet sidechain. Some members of the Blockstream team have also expressed their excitement regarding the prospect of a zerocash sidechain.\nPlenty of Work Still to Be Done\nAlthough it appears many of the most popular features of altcoins will eventually find their way into Bitcoin, it\u2019s important to remember that these are still very much works-in-progress. Segregated Witness, which is currently being tested and reviewed in the form of a pull request to Bitcoin Core, is a big step forward for these sorts of changes, and BIP 9 (Version Bits) should also be helpful as a new method of deployment for soft forks.\nSidechains could be another major step forward \u2012 eventually. The discussion as to how this functionality will be added to Bitcoin was recently started on the Bitcoin development mailing list by Sztorc. Rootstock plans to launch via a federated peg model at first, and it\u2019s still unclear exactly when a decentralized, 2-way peg will be possible with Bitcoin.\nGreg Maxwell recently provided an update on the current status on sidechains from Blockstream\u2019s perspective.", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 19}

Now, users can buy and sell bitcoin in the United States and Canada through the oldest wallet in the Bitcoin space besides the original Satoshi client.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to join forces with the Mycelium team and bring this new service to Mycelium users,\u201d said Dave Ripley, CEO of Glidera. \u201cMycelium offers one of the most secure and easy-to-use wallets on the market, and the addition of Glidera will further improve the experience for new and existing users.\u201d\u00a0\nGlidera does not hold customer funds at any time and will manage compliance, payment fraud management and liquidity challenges.\u00a0\n\u201cThe Glidera integration reinforces the broader Mycelium vision of becoming the user\u2019s hub for financial services,\u201d said Nikolay Chichkanov, vice president of product for Mycelium. \u201cWe plan to continue investing in the Mycelium wallet, bringing more value to users.\u201d\u00a0\nThe news comes on the heels of major milestones for the Mycelium project. With less than a day left in its crowdsale, Mycelium has raised 2,145 bitcoins at approximately a $19 million valuation.\nThe company has been selling a 5 percent nondilutable stake in Mycelium since May 1, and it will continue until May 18. This stake will grant the owner rights to any future company growth, similar to a stock, but in the form of a Stock Appreciation Rights (SAR).\n\u201cLike stocks,\u201d Murashchik explains, \u201cthat grant you ownership of a company\u2019s assets, and that the company can buy back from you in exchange for company cash you technically own, SARs grant you rights to a company's assets, but you can cash out on your own.\u201d\nOne of the longest-standing Bitcoin companies is poised to become the first one to sell a stake directly on the blockchain.\u00a0\nIn April Mycelium announced a new wallet, which will feature a range of products and integrations designed to simplify the use of blockchain assets. The company, which announced the new wallet on Reddit, expects to shortly integrate various API integrations for developers and business representatives.\u00a0\nMycelium developers, burdened by fulfilling customer requests for no payment, made the choice to allow others to integrate services into the Mycelium wallet. Now people can run their businesses on the wallet.\u00a0\nThe company started before Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin, first as a decentralized message transfer hardware. The firm switched to Bitcoin soon after it was released, \u201csince Bitcoin is likewise a decentralized method of transferring messages,\u201d according to Mycelium community manager Dmitry \u201cRassah\u201d Murashchik. Mycelium says it now has more than 250,000 users.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have very few serious competitors, and a huge time advantage over others, having already started on our new platform project, and already having developed business relationships with companies providing their services within our wallet,\u201d Murashchik explains. \u201cThe business plan we are targeting \u2012 an app platform connecting users to businesses \u2012 has already been tested and proven to work. We have built our entire company on having a strong reputation, being open about our intentions and our activity, and plan to continue doing so in the future.\u201d\nThe initial planning stages for the new direction were held back in August, and work started in October.\u00a0\n\u201cUnfortunately, our original plan of using Java for Android and RoboVM to emulate Java on iOS had a major setback, when Microsoft bought RoboVM and un-opensourced it,\u201d Murashchik said. \u201cThat set us back probably a few months. However, just in time, React Native released support for Android, and we quickly switched to that. We considered React Native earlier, but with it only having support for iOS at the time, we dismissed it.\u201d\nMycelium has thus far designed for its new project a functional demo wallet that works with testnet bitcoins, and is only now starting to build out the API and other functions. There has yet to be much precedent for a universal Bitcoin wallet. The overall idea, nevertheless, is fairly well-established and understood in the Bitcoin Community.\u00a0\n\u201cJust as you may have a bare Android OS that lets you expand its functionality by downloading more apps, while Google earns money on paid apps, we plan to have a bare wallet that lets you download plugins, while we earn money on the paid ones,\u201d Murashchik explains.\u00a0\nThe new Mycelium suite stands out because of its support for multiple digital currencies and blockchain-based assets. Thus, users will need only one wallet \u2012 the Mycelium wallet \u2012 to manage multiple digital assets. Mycelium says its customers have simply requested such a tool.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are more interested in being able to store digital assets that either have some function, like Ethereum, Namecoin, Factom, Maidsafe and things like that, or that have real world backing, such as company stocks, fiat-backed tokens or digital registry of physical assets like deeds to property,\u201d Murashchik told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThe new functionality will be agnostic to any kind of cryptoasset.\u201d\nDevelopers will be able to use the API for Litecoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum and other blockchain assets in what Mycelium calls a \u201cCrypto-Swiss knife.\u201d Mycelium also boasts bookkeeping, receivables, expenses, invoicing, social media and contacts to better manage one\u2019s blockchain-related financial world.\u00a0\nOther features dreamed of in the future include support for fiat accounts, remittances, virtual and physical debit cards, a personal finance manager, an investment platform, escrow accounts and digital asset creation and exchange functions.\u00a0\nMycelium already offers a few third-party features. It consistently receives requests from other companies to add new features. This has, ultimately, cost Mycelium resources and money.\u00a0\n\u201cEvery time we obliged,\u201d Murashchik said, \u201cmeant that one or more of our developers would have to be set aside to do the coding themselves, costing us valuable time and resources. Frustratingly, it also kept distracting us from our core goals, which is to create the most up-to-date, functional and privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet.\u201d\nThe team has struggled for years to find time to add support for CoinJoin and stealth addresses.\u00a0\n\u201cEventually we just had enough,\u201d he said, \u201cand decided to make a wallet that would allow others to add their own features themselves, while leaving us to focus on just the things we believe are important. I was also concerned about feature creep in our current wallet, where all the things are very tightly integrated and difficult to manage, and looking at the example of the years it took for Core to be broken up from the nose, wallet and miner into its various components, wanted us to break our app into smaller modular sections while we still can. Setting ourselves up as a platform for cryptofinance to make money from connecting businesses to users was a nice benefit, too.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOur current wallet is becoming a bloated monstrosity, where you have no choice but to download and use all of our third-party features,\u201d Murashchik admits. \u201cThis makes it difficult to code, and makes security audits more complicated. A change in one feature could expose users to a security hole in another. Breaking the wallet into modules and adding plugin support will limit security audits to individual separate components, and will allow users to choose which functions they want and which they don't. Those who want a light, secure wallet that focuses on user privacy will have that option, and, likewise, those who want a feature-full wallet that lets them share their life and money with family and friends will have that option as well.\u201d\nTo be sure, Mycelium is not looking for traditional investors: \u201cWe are just offering our users and other crypto-anarchists a way to both contribute to our new wallet, and receive a stake in our possible future growth.\u201d\nUsers can register for the crowdsale on Mycelium\u2019s website. The Mycelium tokens are sold as colored coins using the Colu platform. Participants purchase tokens in bitcoin, and receive upon the crowdsale\u2019s end.", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 18}

The team wants to position itself as an industry-leading blockchain infrastructure provider, focusing on interoperability, scalability, performance and security. Rubix is specifically designed to allow developers to create and deploy decentralized applications in a full-stack blockchain environment customizable for unique industry and business needs.\nRubix Core is a lab-in-a-box solution that allows users to get their hands dirty and build the Distributed Applications (Dapps) of interest to them. In fact, many users are interested in building Dapps that are relevant to their business problems, without (necessarily) having to get into the weeds of the underlying protocol configurations.\n\u201cRubix was born out of necessity,\u201d said Matt Spoke, a cofounder of Rubix by Deloitte. \u201cNecessity to challenge our own status quo. Necessity to fill a gap in the market. And necessity to be part of the change happening in the world.\u201d\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Iliana Oris Valiente, a cofounder of Rubix by Deloitte, who leads the business development function and general strategy, to find out more about Rubix\u2019s value proposition. Prior to Rubix, Oris Valiente worked in corporate finance and M&A;, specializing in valuations for technology and resource companies, business strategy, financial diligence and models, operations and marketing.\nOris Valiente explained that the Rubix team has built an Ethereum compliant enterprise infrastructure, as well as a set of GUI tools that make it simple for an enterprise developer to create smart contract Dapps.\u00a0\n\u201cOur approach is to develop the tools that allow our user community to rapidly build blockchain prototypes while remaining true to our mission: Continue to build technology that enables users to get out of the testing lab and into production environments,\u201d she told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThis is no small feat, since it requires a mindful approach to scalability, security and interoperability considerations. The market (both the blockchain industry and the enterprise world) have evolved tremendously since our launch in 2014. Not surprisingly, our technology, operating model and the strategy around our involvement in the open source community have evolved as well.\u201d\nOris Valiente explained that Rubix\u2019s goal is to fill a niche in the enterprise blockchain market \u2012 providing a full stack infrastructure and a customized support structure that's flexible enough to meet the needs of the company\u2019s clients.\n\u201cEvery business is different; business models, industry requirements, operating models, access to deep technology development expertise internally, blockchain strategy and appetite for innovation being just some factors,\u201d she said. \u201cWe recognize that some clients are at a stage where they require a comprehensive solution with a customizable blockchain configuration; meanwhile for other users, access to the Rubix Core lab environment gives them the flexibility to get started with prototyping. While we continue to work with clients individually, we are excited to also provide the tools that empower users to unleash their creativity in designing and building unique solutions for their business requirements.\u201d\nThe involvement of Deloitte gives extra credibility and clout to Rubix\u2019s claims. Considered one of the Big Four auditing firms along with PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young, and KPMG, Deloitte is the second-largest professional services network in the world by revenue and the largest by the number of professionals. The company provides audit, tax, consulting, enterprise risk and financial advisory services with more than 200,000 professionals in more than 150 countries. Therefore, Deloitte\u2019s support is likely to help Rubix capture a large, high-profile user base.\nOris Valiente explained that Rubix is a technology venture backed by Deloitte, and it operates as a startup focused on developing a full-stack blockchain infrastructure used by clients as well as by many internal Deloitte teams. \u00a0\u201cWhen it comes to client-specific projects to develop distributed applications, we have the ability to work closely with Deloitte subject matter experts to provide additional insights on the relevant industries that our clients operate in,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe have quite the unique story, actually, for how we came about,\u201d Oris Valiente told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cMy interest in blockchain was piqued in back in 2012 and I\u2019ve been an avid supporter of the Bitcoin ecosystem since. Since I was working at Deloitte, in a corporate finance background, I often wondered if the firm would ever take an active role in this industry. Turns out that I wasn\u2019t the only one thinking about this. Luckily, the Canadian CEO of Deloitte is a major supporter of innovation and launched a \u2018CEO challenge,\u2019 inviting all employees to submit ideas for new service offerings or any other idea that could change the way we operated as a business.\u201d\n\u201cI was part of a small team of self-identifying blockchain enthusiasts that put together a proposal for what would eventually become Rubix,\u201d Valiente continued. \u201cOut of 600-plus ideas, we were shortlisted into the top twelve, top five, and eventually were selected as one of the top ideas to receive seed funding. This was back in the fall of 2014, and, at the time, we projected that our focus would be on consulting and integration services for this new industry. However, as we started working with clients and getting ever more connected into the blockchain ecosystem, we realized that there was an opportunity to fill a market need by building the blockchain infrastructure that is tailored to the unique needs of enterprises.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate that Deloitte made the leap to invest in this evolving space, despite the fact that in 2014 very few large corporations were seriously considering the implications of this technology,\u201d concluded Oris Valiente. \u201cSince our inception, Deloitte has been a great enabler, giving us the autonomy to develop our strategy, pivot, invest in growing a technology team and go through the necessary research and development phases, that ultimately bring us to where we are today.\u201d\nImages via Deloitte Rubix", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 19}

Under normal circumstances, recording student achievements using paperwork can be labor-intensive and costly, making blockchain a significant step toward maximizing cheapness, security and transparency.\nHolberton School of software engineering, based in San Francisco, is now actively recording student achievements through blockchain. In October 2015, the institution\u00a0announced its plans, making it the world\u2019s first school to authenticate academic certificates in this way.\nAn\u00a0example of what an academic certificate stored in the Bitcoin blockchain from Holberton School would look like can be seen on\u00a0Merkle.io.\nAccording to\u00a0HireRight, 86 percent of employers surveyed said that screening had exposed a candidate who had lied on his or her resume. Holberton School understands the struggles that companies face, which is one of the reasons it chose to store students\u2019 academic records in the blockchain, Sylvain Kalache, co-founder of the school, told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\u201cFor employers, it avoids having them spend valuable time checking candidates\u2019 educational credentials by having to call universities or to pay a third party to do the job,\u201d he said.\nAnd using the blockchain helps to save the school money by not having to build and operate its own database of records.\n\u201cBecause of the design of the blockchain\u2019s distributed database, it cannot go down and cannot be altered, making the data always available and secure,\u201d Kalache said. \u201cIt\u2019d be a big responsibility if we were to build and maintain such an infrastructure. The blockchain does this free of charge.\n\u201cOur students are very happy about the fact that their academic qualifications will be secure in the storage of the future,\u201d Kalache said. \u201cThey also see how the industry is massively investing in the blockchain, and they are proud to be part of the school that was the first to use it.\u201d\nThe\u00a0University of Nicosia in Cyprus is also turning its attention to blockchain technology as a way of recording students\u2019 achievements. Digital currency lecturer George Papageorgiou told Bitcoin Magazine that the use of the technology is becoming quite popular.\n\u201cStudents have been enthusiastic, knowing there\u2019s an immutable trail of their prowess in the Bitcoin blockchain, which doesn\u2019t compromise their privacy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey or their future employers can use simple tools to verify the validity of their certificates themselves.\u201d\nWith the first set of students graduating in June with an MSc in Digital Currency, Papageorgiou says they are helping other universities to incorporate blockchain technology.\n\u201cWe are working to improve the processes involved and expand this function to other university certificates as well as work with other universities desiring to build this functionality for their systems.\u201d\nCatching On\n\u201cThe immutability of a public blockchain like Bitcoin\u2019s and/or Ethereum\u2019s could serve as a unifying structure for the proof-of-certificates globally,\u201d Papageorgiou said. \u201cIf transactions are signed with a key known to belong to the university, anyone trying to verify a certificate can validate the whole process all the way back to the issuing institution.\u201d\nConsidering the advantages of blockchain, Kalache said he doesn\u2019t see why it shouldn\u2019t catch on with other schools.\n\u201cThe only downside could be the challenge to interact with the technology itself, which can be pretty intimidating and complicated,\u201d he said. \u201cBut guess what: The blockchain is becoming mainstream, and big players are entering the game.\u201d\nKalache is talking about Holberton School mentor and IBM Vice President of Technology Jerry Cuomo, who believes that the blockchain will fundamentally change the way businesses are run after recently announcing the\u00a0blockchain as a service so that any business can use it.\nSony also recently announced\u00a0blockchain as a service to provide schools an easy way to share their academic certificates in the blockchain.\n\u201cThe technology has the potential to realize an entirely new infrastructure system for sharing records securely over the network in any number of ways, opening new doors of possibility for academic records and how they are assessed,\u201d\u00a0Sony Global Education said in a press release.\nPhoto\u00a0Sylvain Kalache\u00a0/ Flickr(CC)", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 18}

Reflections on the $155 Million (And Growing) Autonomous Behemoth", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/holy-dao-reflections-on-the-million-and-growing-autonomous-behemoth-1463756859/", "birthday": "May 20, 2016  11:07 AM EST", "date": "2016-05-20 16:07:00", "content": "@AugurProject\n@BlockchainEDU\n@BlockchainCap as an EIR/Associate\nDAO: a distributed, autonomous corporation.\u00a0\n(A backgrounder can be found\u00a0here.)\n\u00a0\nJust more than a year ago, as I was completing work on\u00a0Augur, a couple of old friends proposed to me a crypto-equity crowdfunding entity. It would be structured similar to \u201cThe DAO\u201d currently being flooded with ether right now. I was skeptical, to say the least.\nThis is a group text I received from them a few days ago. (Edited for clarity):\n\u201cThe DAO was [our] idea, and it\u2019s going to put your b**** company out of business.\nPower of the people, not some dudes that burn everyone\u2019s money into the ground.\u201d\nThis made me LOL for a few reasons.\u00a0\nBut for context: I now work as an investor at a blockchain-focused venture capital firm.\nThe first reason I was amused by this text was the eternal truth of entrepreneurship: Ideas are 1 percent of a business, execution is 99 percent.\u00a0\nSecondly: Venture-capital funds don\u2019t burn \u201ceveryone\u2019s\u201d money (maybe limited partners\u2019) \u2014 they invest money into startups who, then, in turn, may burn it. (Notably, \u201cVC-backed ventures have more impactful innovations and experience faster commercialization rates\u201d than angel investors,\u00a0according to the Journal of Business Venturing.)\nMost importantly: Having been immersed in the incredibly intricate business of venture capital for the past year, I am even more unconvinced that a DAO really has a substantial place in the world of investing.\nLastly, as someone who cofounded one of the first DAOs (Augur), please allow me to lay out my thoughts on this extraordinary fundraising phenomenon, because I am mildly terrified by what is happening.\n\u00a0\nTo give my friends credit, there is a role for DAOs in the world of finance, albeit a small one. Let me provide an anecdote from my own entrepreneurial experience to elucidate:\nWhen we first started building\u00a0Augur, a decentralized prediction market platform, we quickly came to the conclusion that there was no way we could incorporate an entity building our software as a for-profit organization. Our consensus mechanism relied on the participation of thousands of individuals reporting on the outcome of events using a token.\nThus, a crowdsale (crowdfunding), as opposed to venture capital, was\u00a0the only game-theoretically viable manner with which to distribute the token. However, without a minimum viable product (MVP), we had no capacity to execute such a financing.\u00a0\nA platform like \u201cThe DAO\u201d would have been an excellent way to sell early access to the token, at a discount, before we had an MVP good enough for a crowdsale.\u00a0\nBut how many software projects have a similar structure to Augur? Considering it took us only $300,000 to get to a crowdsale, and the $5.5 million we received was more than enough to sustain the software for the near future \u2014 it\u2019s hard to see where the $147 million currently raised will be invested.\nThis is particularly relevant as any business backed by \u201cThe DAO\u201d has to be built entirely on the Ethereum blockchain (as opposed to having off-chain, or multi-chain, components). In other words, any money made from the proposal that isn\u2019t earned directly through the backed smart contract will not trickle back to the \u201cThe DAO\u201d participants.\nWhen I left Augur to \u201cjoin the dark side\u201d (VC), it was with the expectation that we could hopefully help finance Ethereum-based companies. To my delight, we have been\u00a0able to do so.\nThat being said, I have been less than impressed with the projects that have opted to raise capital through crowdsales since Augur (e.g. Digix, Lisk). Each of these sales raised between $5 million and $6 million, which is substantial, but fortunately not earth-shattering, should they fail.\u00a0\nAnd this touches on an underlying issue with the \u201cThe DAO\u201d: This potentially revolutionary funding mechanism has the capacity to democratize access to capital \u2026 assuming nothing goes wrong.\n\u00a0\nAs with any new technology (following\u00a0The Lean Startup), it would probably be better to test out DAOs slowly, before pouring money into them.\u00a0\nTo many, the $18 million crowdsale behind the Ethereum blockchain was ludicrous. However, blockchains (such as Bitcoin\u2019s) provided some precedent, and obviously the investment paid off (ether, which was sold for 30 cents in the crowdsale, is now trading around $12.30). The $5.5 million behind Augur\u2019s token sale was also labeled as crazy, but at least prediction markets have a long history, the mechanisms behind how Augur would work were clear, and there was a working alpha product.\u00a0\n\u201cThe DAO\u201d has no clear precedent, nor pressing use case. With Title III of the Jobs Act going\u00a0into effect recently, despite its burdensome restrictions, there\u2019s even less of a compelling argument to be made for this new crypto-entity. In the relatively brief time I have worked in venture capital I have yet to see a concept I found to be deserving of backing not receive it.\nBut let\u2019s suppose that \u201cThe DAO\u201d is, in fact, a self-evident tool that the world needs \u2026.\nOne-hundred and forty-seven million dollars is a lot of money. Even to the biggest banks or hedge funds, to Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates\u2014 that sum is substantial. Even if half, or more, of the \u201cinvestors\u201d pull out their contributions before their money gets locked up, there are going to be tens of millions of dollars locked in this smart contract.\u00a0\nShould anything go wrong, there will be hell to pay \u2026 although who will pay is only vaguely clear.\n\u00a0\nFrom Russia to China to the United States, and everywhere in between, hackers, scammers and schemers of all sorts are going to be trying to tap into this massive honeypot.\nI am a huge proponent of the wisdom of crowds. I literally spent a year of my life arguing for it while promoting Augur. But the binary or combinatorial option of predicting who will become president is a lot simpler and more straightforward than regularly reviewing and investing in startup ideas.\u00a0\nHow on earth are the participants in \u201cThe DAO\u201d supposed to conduct, and share, due diligence on entrepreneurs and/or programmers proposing projects? Of course you can have forums and Slack to discuss, but how does one differentiate between noise and valid input? Who is going to do a thorough background check on each submitter? That\u2019s like blindly asking Reddit to make a major life decision for you.\u00a0\nStartup investment is not easy. I have learned this firsthand. Even at a small, boutique venture fund, we spend hours upon hours evaluating a single company. Can DAO members really be expected to do that for the hundreds, or even thousands, of proposals \u201cThe DAO\u201d receives? And with the creators of this entity suggesting that projects request funding monthly, which \u201cinvestors\u201d really have the time for the necessary scrutiny?\nAnother question is how this will logistically work. \u201cThe DAO\u201d totally sounds great in theory. But in practice, it is anyone\u2019s guess. Even with Augur, where the team has gone through MVP, prototype, alpha and beta stages, there\u2019s no saying how the system will truly work until it goes live. Tens of thousands of hours of testing and simulation will help us predict, but only the final product determines a smart contract\u2019s fate. And, of course, there\u2019s the possibility that there may be a bug in the code. In that case, there\u2019s a 100 million dollar-plus bounty for whoever finds it.\u00a0\nI don\u2019t want to dwell on the legal issues here, because I spent too much of my life defending the legality of Augur to now be critical about \u201cThe DAO.\u201d However, I would be beyond shocked if the Securities and Exchange Commission, and beyond, have not taken a keen interest in this platform. The legal research I did for Augur makes so much of this platform alarming, and for good reason.\n\u00a0\nUltimately, I hope 'The DAO' is a wild success.\u00a0\nThe money raised so far has the potential to do no less than radically change the world of bureaucracy, entrepreneurship, venture capital and the very nature of what it means to have a company. It\u2019s a phenomenal idea in theory.\u00a0\nBut I wish we had started a little smaller, and a little less ambitious.\nIf anything goes wrong with this grand initiative, the ramifications for future DAOs (or those such as Augur), smart contract technology and Ethereum will be far greater than what Mt. Gox did for Bitcoin. It would be catastrophic.\nI hope that doesn\u2019t happen. Death by a thousand cuts (or in this instance, poor investments) would be far more optimal. But there\u2019s a large financial incentive for matters to turn awry, quickly.\u00a0\nOne of the reasons venture capital exists is to take risks other sorts of investors and lenders are unwilling, or unable, to take. In the past 60 years, some of the most important technology, medicine and beyond has begun with venture backing. The crowd will never replace a thoughtful, value-added investor.\u00a0\nIdeally, however, \u201cThe DAO\u201d can democratize access to early capital, so the playing field becomes more even for aspiring entrepreneurs, who can then come to professional investors with more fully baked products. That would be truly revolutionary. Alas, only time will tell.\nThe only action that can be taken now is to cross our fingers and hope nothing breaks.\nMy heart can\u2019t take another Gox.\u00a0\nEditor's note: This is a guest post by Jeremy Gardner and the opinions represented are those of the author.", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 20}

The request for proposals, titled \u201cSecure Messaging Platform\u201d and listed under the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program, targets a messaging platform able to transfer messages via a secure decentralized protocol that will be secured across multiple channels, including, but not limited to: transport protocol, encryption of messages via various application protocols and customized blockchain implementation of message deconstruction and reconstruction, and decentralized ledger implementation.\nDARPA notes that the planned Secure Messaging Platform will permit mapping the business logic of the DoD ecosystem onto a network of known entities using distributed ledgers. \u201cBy doing this significant portions of the DoD back office infrastructure can be decentralized, \u2018smart documents and contracts\u2019 can be instantly and securely sent and received thereby reducing exposure to hackers and reducing needless delays in DoD backoffice correspondence,\u201d notes the request for proposal.\nThe ultimate goal of the DoD is to be achieved in three phases. It includes a secure messaging system based on decentralized ledger architecture and blockchain implementation, which can provide repudiation or deniability, perfect forward and backward secrecy, time to live/self-delete for messages, one-time eyes-only messages, a decentralized infrastructure to be resilient to cyber-attacks and ease of use for individuals in less than ideal situations.\nThe objective of the project\u2019s Phase I is to create a specific decentralized messaging platform built on the framework of an existing blockchain. Phase II will develop, test and evaluate a working prototype with specific features, including a decentralized backend blockchain implementation. Finally, Phase III will will focus on full-scale implementation, industrialization and commercialization of the platform.\nSince the project\u2019s Phase I is intended to leverage an existing blockchain implementation, it\u2019s interesting to note that the project\u2019s documentation makes explicit references to the Linux Foundation\u2019s Hyperledger Project, a collaborative effort started in December to develop an open, distributed ledger platform that will satisfy a variety of use cases across multiple industries. Supported by high-profile cross-industry players such as IBM, Intel, Accenture, as well as several banks and financial services firms, the Hyperledger Project has acquired a momentum that seems difficult to stop.\nHyperledger\u2019s blockchain technology is independent of Bitcoin, and many companies in the group support radical alternatives to Bitcoin. For example, Accenture and Digital Asset Holdings, among others, expressed support for private, \u201cpermissioned\u201d non-Bitcoin blockchains. It seems plausible that the permissioned approach is especially appealing for the defense establishment.\nDARPA is not explicitly mandating the use of Hyperledger, but reading the Questions and Answers part of the Secure Messaging Platform request for proposal gives the impression that DARPA is strongly encouraging the use of Hyperledger.\n\u201cThis is a fantastic move, and will pave the road for many entrepreneurs to roll up sleeves and start contributing to this sector\u201d said Kevin Shahbazi, CEO of cloud-based security specialist LogMeOnce, as reported by Fox News. \u201cDARPA\u2019s task is significant, and it will help the market overall.\u201d\u00a0\nShahbazi added that blockchain technology is more trustworthy than legacy systems because messages and transactions are distributed and not kept in one central location, which makes hacking more difficult and at the same time easier to detect.\n\u201cBlockchain protocols are a new class of protocols that are extremely resilient to attack \u2012 they gain that resiliency by virtue of being decentralized,\u201d added Emin Gun Sirer, associate professor of Computer Science at Cornell University. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see the government take an active interest in a very happening and very hot area of computer systems.\u201d\nIn a related move, the NATO Communications and Information Agency is evaluating proposals submitted to the 2016 Innovation Challenge, aimed at accelerating transformational, state-of-the-art technology solutions in support of NATO C4ISR and cyber capability requirements. The request for outline proposals has a section titled \u201cMilitary applications of Blockchains,\u201d which includes application of blockchain technology to military logistics, application of blockchain technology to procurement and finance and a catch-all described as \u201cother applications of interest to the military.\u201d The NATO request for proposal also includes an Internet of Things (IoT) section, which seems appropriate for IoT-related applications of blockchain technology.\nThe growing interest of military agencies is one more signal that blockchain technology is becoming mature and ready for real-world application, and could bring more mainstream credibility and funding to distributed ledger development.", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 23}

The new fitness app for Apple devices,\u00a0Sweatcoin, rewards steps people have taken with digital currency, which can be used to buy goods and services.\nThe British-made app by co-founders Oleg Fomenko, Anton Derlyatka, Danil Perushev and Egor Khmelev, is the latest initiative in a growing fitness economy that features monitoring devices and apps, which reward peoples\u2019 fitness activity with vouchers and discounts.\nTheir aim is to fix an evolutionary bug called \u201cPresent Bias,\u201d which is the human tendency to underestimate things which happen in the future and disproportionately focuses our attention solely on what gives us pleasure right now.\nCurrently only available on iPad and iPhone in the UK, for every 1,000 steps a user will receive one sweatcoin (SWC) with rewards ranging in value on the\u00a0Sweatcoin shop. For example, 20 sweatcoins will get you a pair of Apple headphones, 50 sweatcoins will get you a Wii console and a Wii bundle kit, and 1,300 sweatcoins will get you a PS3 and games.\nSweatcoin\u2019s digital currency approach is driven by\u00a0creating an analogue of fiat currency where issuance and printing requires centralization as the amount of Sweatcoin in variable.\nFomenko, who recently spoke to Bitcoin Magazine, said that there are two things that drive these requirements.\n\u201cSweatcoin can only be issued on the basis of verified movement, and for that we use quantity of movement and geographical location, which can\u2019t be put into the public domain,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce issued, we are keen to ensure that Sweatcoin can be accepted and exchanged between any willing party while allowing us to focus on objective one, which is best done in a decentralized fashion.\u201d\nAs Sweatcoin is community-focused, the use of blockchain technology enables them to engage the community beyond the simple usage of their app as a front-end while enabling them as a business to focus on what they do best \u2013 movement verification.\nDue to the fact that Sweatcoin\u2019s approach is unique with their goal of helping people burn calories, it requires the creation of a custom solution to achieve this. For that they are using a version of Paxos consensus protocol called Byzantine Paxos.\n\u201cCentralized issuance will be using centralized architecture while decentralized transaction processing will use permissioned blockchain using the Byzantine Paxos algorithm,\u201d Fomenko said.\nWhile there will certainly be competition from the likes of British-made start-up, Bitwalking, which is also seeking to launch its own digital currency, Sweatcoin is confident in its software that uses a combination of behavioral and technological solutions to ensure that users can\u2019t fake their activities.\nIts first line of defense is limiting one installation per mobile and per device with a cap on the total number of steps accepted per day at 20,000.\n\u201cThis will not affect most honest users, but it reduces the possible attractiveness for a malicious party to dedicate resources to breaking our platform,\u201d said Fomenko. \u201cThe technological solutions we will be using include heuristics, AI, analytical algorithms and other proprietary solutions that are currently being documented.\u201d\nThis will be the second startup for Fomenko. His last startup, Bloom.fm, was a U.K. music app which launched in 2013 and attracted 1.3 million downloads. If failed after its sole investor, a unit of Gazprom Media, pulled out after Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea, and he failed to obtain fresh funding.\nNow, however, with their sights set on the future, Sweatcoin\u2019s founders have raised nearly $1 million in funding as well as gained the backing of the Greater London Authority and London Sport. The four co-founders say they are determined to make a success of their health and fitness idea incorporating the use of blockchain technology.\n\u201cSweatcoin\u2019s goal is to help people and make them more active, fit and happy,\u201d Fomenko said. \u201cIt will be a business success for us when Sweatcoin starts to have a real value and can be exchanged for fiat currencies.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 24}
{"title": "How Blockchain Technology Is Reinventing Global Trade Efficiency", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/how-blockchain-technology-is-reinventing-global-trade-efficiency-1464206286/", "birthday": "May 25, 2016  3:58 PM EST", "date": "2016-05-25 20:58:00", "content": "This article orginally appeared in\u00a0The Distributed Ledger.\nThe business of moving commercial goods around the planet represents billions of dollars in enterprise revenue\u2014as well as losses and inefficiencies resulting from risk, fraud or anachronistic manual paperwork delays. The good news is that few sectors are poised to so dramatically benefit from the advent of blockchain-based solutions. Given the size of the investment involved, potential efficiencies stand to be monumental.\nAfter a drop-off following the financial crisis of 2007/2008, international trade volumes have been increasing steadily, bringing the infrastructure and mechanisms that underpin the actual business transacted \u2013 supply chain management and trade finance \u2013 under increasing scrutiny, because of the processing delays and related risks involved.\nSupply chain management refers to the structures and processes that guide the flow of goods from raw materials to the delivery of a finished product to an end consumer. Generally this involves a number of different companies, each focused on a step in the chain such as processing and manufacturing, inventory management or quality control. The combined steps of the overall chain of activities result in the final supply of the product \u2013 and by the time the chain is complete, a number of physical and financial transactions have taken place.\nBut the business of global supply chain management is far from perfect. Transactions often involve manual paper (and unstructured electronic) transfers of records (purchase orders, invoices, bills of lading, customs documentation, certificates of authenticity and makeup) that accompany physical goods. Keeping track of the ownership of physical goods and inventory at each step, along with the corresponding paper flows, can be a major undertaking, especially with manual processes that are subject to human error, loss, damage and even theft and fraud.\nBlockchain-based solutions to both physical and financial supply chain issues are being proposed by a number of startups. Vendors in the physical supply chain space include CargoChain and Everledger, which is focused on ensuring authenticity and minimizing fraud in the international trade of diamonds (and also, more recently, fine art). Blockchain immutability, together with the transparent, multiple-party access it provides to the same shared ledger, are seen as key functional attributes to improving efficiency in the supply chain process of tracking the changing ownership of goods.\nAs goods pass from seller to buyer in the supply chain, so monetary payments are required. Enabling these transfers to take place, and ensuring that companies are paid faster (against a backdrop of higher credit costs and corporate priorities for increased cash flow) is facilitated by financial services companies, whose mechanisms for this are commonly referred to as either supply chain finance or trade finance. Managing supply payments against invoices and related cash management can be a burden, and increases greatly in complexity when transactions are across national borders, involving correspondent banks as intermediaries.\nTrade finance processing has historically been supported by offerings from vendors such as Misys, SAP and Surecomp, and implemented by traditional banks as a service to their corporate customers.\nA common trade finance offering provided by banks (and increasingly by alternative financial services providers) is known as factoring, and involves a bank paying the seller of goods before the buyer of those goods makes the payment. Naturally, banks charge rates (typically 4 percent to as high as 8 percent) to the supplier for this service, but assume the risk that the buyer delays payment or even defaults. Despite that protection, factoring is a costly undertaking for suppliers, eating significantly into margins and introducing an element of insecurity to the payment picture.\nFor all parties, factoring involves multiple risk factors including nonpayment, duplicate payment, misrepresentation and even fraud. And setting risk aside, processing costs related to manual due diligence, document collection and coordination of remittances are high.\nHowever, blockchain approaches are also being proposed to boost efficiency in this area, with developments from the likes of Skuchain and Fluent.\n\"Currently, bank-run trade finance programs require a tremendous amount of resource-intensive due diligence, document collection and processing, including coordination of remittance information. Financing rates are high for the businesses despite the low and shrinking margins for the financing provider. This is especially true at smaller banks who lack this infrastructure and must outsource these services for their larger clients,\" notes Lamar Wilson, CEO of Fluent.\nFounded in 2014, Fluent offers a number of blockchain-based services for banks, other large companies and non-bank lenders. These include applications for real-time B2B payments, supply chain finance and a peer-to-peer working capital marketplace.\nBy leveraging purpose-built blockchain technology in its Fluent Network, the vendor is able to improve upon current trade finance in a number of ways:\n- Invoices can be tokenized once a buyer approves them, avoiding duplicate and fraudulent invoices across the network.\n- Such approved payables can be split up and sold in a variety of ways, including incrementally, in a multi-lender marketplace. Lenders can purchase parts of invoices to reduce risk, lowering the cost of capital to the supplier.\n- There\u2019s no more need to track and coordinate remittance information. The blockchain immutably captures the data attached to each invoice, allowing a buyer to easily pay without needing to know who owns the invoice.\n\u201cOn the Fluent Network, finance providers are sure the risk associated with duplicate and fraudulent invoices is mitigated by the tokenization of each invoice, creating a digital asset that can be transferred between markets, partially financed by multiple parties and grouped together to create new assets,\u201d notes Wilson, adding: \u201cPayments are programmatically tied to each invoice so buyers do not have to collect additional remittance information and can simply pay the invoice directly on the Fluent platform no matter who owns the assets across the globe.\u201d\nSince its founding, Fluent has raised $2.5 million in financing from a number of sources, including ff Venture Capital, Digital Currency Group, Fenbushi Capital, Crosscut Ventures, Lindbergh Tech Fund, the St. Louis Arch Angels, Draper Associates, Thomson Reuters, 500 Startups, UMB Bank, SixThirty and others. The company also recently announced Kansas City, Missouri-based Commerce Bank as a pilot user of its services.\nInformation and media giant Thomson Reuters\u2019 investment in blockchain is driven by a desire to understand the technology and its potential real-world applications. According to a blog post, the company is working on \u201cdelivering a couple of early proof-of-concepts to test the effectiveness of blockchain on Thomson Reuters use cases. We are in the game to be a leader and trusted advisor to our customers about blockchain, and to develop real applications as this technology matures.\u201d\nNote: Fluent, CargoChain, Commerce Bank and Everledger are among the companies presenting in the supply chain stream at the Distributed: Trade conference taking place on June 14 in St. Louis, Missouri. SixThirty and Thomson Reuters will also be part of the program. Panel sessions will cover how blockchain is being applied to supply chain management and trade finance, within financial services, and how businesses can integrate with blockchain technology.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nOver the past years, the Dutch town of Arnhem\u00a0consistently made headlines for its exceptional Bitcoin project:\u00a0Arnhem Bitcoincity. Launched in 2014, the initiative started with 15 bars and restaurants accepting bitcoin and has since grown to include more than 100 brick-and-mortar bars, restaurants, stores and more. With some 150,000 inhabitants, Arnhem might even be the most Bitcoin-dense municipality in the world, and can perhaps be considered a testing ground for Bitcoin-use for retail payments.\nTo celebrate the project's two-year anniversary, its local initiators \u2013 Annet de Boer, Patrick van der Meijde and Rogier Eijkelhof \u2013 will organize a conference in Arnhem:\u00a0Bitcoin in Use, to be followed by a more informal meetup and pub-crawl through the city. They are joined by Arnhem-resident Otto de Voogd, who himself recently\u00a0made the news for his long-lasting legal battle with Estonia; the Financial Intelligence Unit of the Baltic country investigated him for Bitcoin-trading.\nBitcoin Magazine spoke with the four about Bitcoin and retail payments, their Arnhem Bitcoincity project, and the Bitcoin in Use conference.\nSo, what exactly is going on in Arnhem? What is Arnhem Bitcoincity?\nPatrick: Inspired by a similar initiative in Kreuzberg, Berlin \u2012 which introduced a special Bitcoin area in 2013 \u2012 we wanted to set up something similar in our own hometown. It actually started out as a one-time only event, a pub-crawl. Or at least that's how we lured the participating bars and restaurants in. It's only after the pub-crawl that we suggested they could continue to accept bitcoin with no extra effort, and most did. That's how we got the ball rolling, and as more merchants agreed to accept bitcoin, it garnered more attention in the media and stuff like that, and that helped us find even more merchants to participate.\nOtto: I actually moved to Arnhem because of the Bitcoincity project. I wanted to get out of Estonia for obvious reasons, and Arnhem seemed like the place to go.\nHow many merchants have joined the project so far?\nAnnet: 104 merchants at the moment.\nPatrick: Make that 105, Annet! 'Arnhem Store' will be the latest to join. That\u2019s a shop that sells products from Arnhem-based artists; mostly clothes, I believe.\nWhat else can you buy with bitcoin in Arnhem?\nAnnet: You can actually buy EVERYTHING with bitcoin here, from toilet paper to bread, to gas for your car, cut your hair, buy presents, buy clothes or shoes, or a hammer or a TV.\nOtto: Arnhem Bitcoincity shows that bitcoin can and does get used to pay for normal everyday things, that it can function as a currency in people's daily life.\nRogier: Pretty much the only thing I can't pay with bitcoin yet are taxes, haha.\nDo these merchants actually accept bitcoin and keep it as bitcoin, or do they use a payment processor to convert it into euros?\nRogier: We developed our own Bitcoin payment processing solution\u00a0BitKassa, to offer to merchants in context of the Arnhem Bitcoincity project. We wanted to make the merchant experience as great as possible. All they need is an Internet-connected device; we provide an easy user interface, and they have Dutch people to talk to in case they encounter any problems. Merchants can choose if they want to keep the bitcoins, keep a share, or have it fully converted to euros and transferred to their bank account instead. Most merchants opt for euros, but there's about 15 of them that keep the bitcoins.\nWhat have you learned over the years? Have you spotted any significant trends?\nRogier: We actually publish\u00a0live statistics on our own website. As you can see, our monthly total is roughly a few thousand euros worth of bitcoin, spread over some 100 to 150 transactions. So, three to five bitcoin-payments a day, on average. This typically increases a bit when the price rises. There is also a slight increase in volume over time, I\u2019d say, although it's pretty volatile.\nWhere do you think this increase is coming from? New people using Bitcoin? Existing Bitcoin users being able to spend more? Bitcoin-enthusiasts from outside of Arnhem increasingly visiting the city?\nOtto: I do have a feeling that Arnhem is becoming a curiosity in the Bitcoin world. People have taken note, and many of them probably think of coming here to see it for themselves. But if they actually do is another question.\nRogier: I'd like to think we've helped spread Bitcoin-adoption in Arnhem, although I think using bitcoin to actually pay for real products and services is still only a fraction of the total Bitcoin transaction volume.\nAnd a small fraction of Arnhem transaction volume.\nRogier: Yes, compared to the total economy in Arnhem, of course Bitcoin is still only a tiny fraction. But it's gotta start somewhere; revolutions like these take time to develop. Compare it to the Internet in the \u201890s. Rarely anybody used email at that time. Now, we don't know any better, and can hardly imagine life without. We strongly feel that Bitcoin will have a similar impact in due time, and the moderate success we have here in Arnhem \u2013 even though we're proud of it \u2013 is only a small step on the road.\nWhy should people use bitcoin for retail payments at all? Aren't there more convenient options available?\nOtto: I think there are many reasons. Basically, it combines the advantages of electronic payments with the advantages of cash, while avoiding some of the downsides of both these options. For example, I don't like that the bank still knows where I spent 5 euros 10 years ago. They know more about me than I know about me. Bitcoin gives us back a certain degree of privacy. And compared to cash, you can back up your keys, which makes Bitcoin safer against loss. There's also no hassle with change. It's impossible to counterfeit. And of course you can send it over long distances.\nRogier: I'm inclined to say that by paying in bitcoin instead of euros or dollars, you're contributing to freeing society from the modern form of slavery the banking system has successfully bestowed upon us for decades without most people even realizing it. But maybe I shouldn't get too fundamentalist here, hehe.\nAnnet: I would like to add that spending bitcoin is possibly the best way to promote it. Many people tend to want to sit on their bitcoin and merely wait for it to increase in value. But to increase adoption we need to develop an economy. Sure, buy back the bitcoins you've spent, but do spend them!\nRogier: Yes, using bitcoin for actual, live, face-to-face payments makes people more aware of it. Many people only hear about Bitcoin through the mainstream media. And we all know the stories ... they\u2019re never positive. Putting Bitcoin to actual, everyday use sheds a different light on things. People are surprised to see how amazingly well it works. If everyone would do what did in Arnhem, Bitcoin would definitely be at a complete different level now.\nPatrick: And scaling would be a REAL problem, hehe.\nHave you encountered any problems so far due to network congestion, or other scaling-related issues?\nRogier: Zero so far. Although we did encounter some transactions that took long to confirm, during the \u201cstress tests.\u201d But this was irrelevant for merchants or customers. We accept zero-confirmation payments, so the entire shopping and paying experience was not affected at all.\nWhat about double-spends of unconfirmed transactions? Have you ever been defrauded?\nPatrick: We've never been defrauded. But double-spending is a real problem.\nRogier: When opt-in replace-by-fee was about to be introduced, we had to take some preliminary measures to assure our zero-confirmation payments wouldn't get reversed as soon as a customer walks out of the door. If someone now pays with replace-by-fee enabled, the payment is rejected immediately and sent back to the address it originated from. And, of course, the merchant is notified.\nSo opt-in replace-by-fee is not really a problem for you then?\nRogier: In general, I'm not particularly in favor of replace-by-fee. I think it causes more problems than it solves. And the problems it does \u2013 potentially \u2013 solve could have been taken care of differently, like child-pays-for-parent.\nAnnet: When paying for coffee or something like that, there's no use to enable replace-by-fee. Mobile wallets that incorporate the feature should allow users to easily disable it. Or not make it default in the first place, or something like that.\nThough of course, unconfirmed transactions always a carry a certain risk.\nRogier: New developments to solve these kinds of problems, like the Lightning Network and payment channels, sound pretty promising to me. Essentially, Bitcoin is still in its development stage. I'm confident that in the long run, Bitcoin \u2013 or payment solutions running on top of Bitcoin \u2013 will be perfectly fine for both huge transactions worldwide, as well as your local coffee purchase.\nSo what will the \u201cBitcoin in Use\u201d conference be about?\nAnnet: On Arnhem Bitcoincity\u2019s one-year anniversary, we organized a pub-crawl type of party. We wanted to repeat that this year, but we were also looking for something new. We were impressed with how Paul Buitink, a Dutch Bitcoin-evangelist, organized two Bitcoin-inspired conferences over the last years. We thought it would be awesome to do something like that in Arnhem. That\u2019s how the combination of a conference and a huge meetup and party was born.\nYou've been able to attract some familiar faces in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency space to come and speak. Bitcoin Core\u00a0developer Peter Todd, Pirate Party\u00a0founder Rick Falkvinge, Monero\u00a0lead developer Riccardo Spagni,\u00a0Berlin\u2019s Bitcoin-project\u00a0initiator Joerg Platzer,\u00a0Bitsquare\u00a0founder Manfred Karrer... How did you convince them to come and make it all the way to your town in the east of The Netherlands?\nOtto: We actually met a few of these guys at conferences ourselves over the years. Or we know someone who knows them. So we started reaching out, and they were excited to make it to Arnhem.\nPatrick: I'm really happy with the lineup so far. While it's not set in stone, I hope Peter Todd will explain his long-term vision for Bitcoin, and share his thoughts on our project. Rick Falkvinge will show how Bitcoin can be used to support decentralized organizations, like a political party. Manfred Karrer will tell us about his decentralized Bitcoin-exchange Bitsquare, which seems like a promising project. Riccardo Spagni will give a talk on Monero, which we think is one of the very few interesting altcoins out there. And Joerg Platzer, in a way our inspirator, will talk about his experience setting up the famous Bitcoin neighborhood in Berlin. And we might add more speakers; the schedule is not final yet.\nIf you'd have to name one key aspect, how does 'Bitcoin in Use' differentiate itself from other Bitcoin conferences?\nOtto: In the end this is a celebration of Arnhem Bitcoincity. So there's the conference, and all the interesting speakers, but that's not all. Outside of the conference you can get to know Arnhem with fellow-Bitcoiners and indeed pay for everything with bitcoin.\nPatrick: There will even be a special beer-fest right outside the conference hall, of which three of the four organizing bars accept bitcoin.\nAnnet: And for those who stay the night \u2013 yes, you can pay for hotels in bitcoin \u2013 we'll organize a city tour the next day. That will include a lunch, payable in bitcoin; we'll visit a large church that has a panorama-lift for a great view, also payable in bitcoin... We'll make the Arnhem Bitcoin experience complete!\nPhoto\u00a0Janwillemvanaalst\u00a0/ Wikimedia Commons", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 24}

It was during the Cold War that a lack of transparency led to a breakdown of trust between countries, and one of the objectives of these games was to find ways to ensure that too much power was never given to any one individual or group.\nThe new project by BunkerChain Labs, codenamed \u201cPeerplays,\u201d uses a high-speed program called Graphene to automatically connect players from around the world, enabling online gaming and wagering that is highly resistant to cheating.\nTwo years in the making, the project began with delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS), a decentralized autonomous cooperative organization (DAC or DAO) supporting protocol that was developed by Invictus Innovations, Inc., which later became Cryptonomex, for BitShares in the spring of 2014. A year later, a modified and improved version of the DPoS Graphene was released under the MIT free software license, with some of the Peerplays team taking part in its development.\n\u201cThe Peerplays team began to design and implement a platform that combines Graphene with a set of smart contracts that enables users to wager and compete in provably fair games, which are hosted directly on the blockchain,\u201d said Michael P. Maloney, Peerplays communications manager, in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine.\nIt was in the fall of 2015 that Neil Haran, the Peerplays project lead, approached BunkerChain Labs, to discuss the possibility of using blockchain technology to build a transparent and provably fair wagering platform that would eliminate the ability for unchecked \u201csuperpowers\u201d to control and manipulate the games.\n\u201cToday, the online gaming industry is plagued with accusations of cheating by players and system administrators, but nothing can really be done about it as long as games lack transparency and continue to be hosted by private companies on private servers,\u201d said Maloney.\nIn order to solve this issue, BunkerChain Labs, took the idea to the developers who helped create Graphene, and who began to design and implement a blockchain-based platform to solve the problem before going public on May 9.\nBuilt on a custom blockchain, Peerplays is possible because of third-party services known as \u201cgateways.\u201d\n\u201cGateways issue tokens backed by Bitcoin onto the Peerplays decentralized exchange, and players can then purchase or redeem these tokens like exchanging money for chips at a casino,\u201d said Maloney. \u201cRight now there are many reputable companies that operate gateways on existing decentralized exchanges like BitShares and NXT.\u201d\nUnlike the supercomputer called WOPR in the 1983 hit movie, \u201cWar Games,\u201d which mistook a computer game for real-life and almost set off a global thermonuclear war, Peerplays is programmed to remain neutral. As Peerplays is a decentralized network, with no single gaming company gaining an advantage or monopoly over it, it seeks to be a major disruptor to the online gaming industry. However, it\u2019s not limited to on-chain games.\n\u201cIn fact anyone can plug their website into the blockchain API and Peerplays will manage tournaments and process wagers for third-party games,\u201d said Maloney. \u201cThis will help tournament hosting companies to reduce their costs while minimizing the liabilities and risks involved with managing the infrastructure required to operate a centralized gaming and wagering platform.\u201d\nUnlike war in the real world, the peer-to-peer war games enabled by Peerplays will ensure that the winner can\u2019t go back and rewrite the official record of what took place, as it is completely open-source and 100 percent transparent. Not only that, but Peerplays will be the first blockchain-based platform that allows users to schedule tournaments, wager funds and play games 100 percent on-chain.\n\u201cAnyone in the world with Internet access will be able to use Peerplays to wager and compete, while all their funds are held safely out of reach of any third party,\u201d said Maloney. \u201cPeerplays\u2019 provably fair gaming could help reduce the estimated tens of millions of dollars that fair players lose to cheaters each year.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 26}

Notwithstanding, Australian stakeholders and government want this technology to be sustainable in the long-term. ISO and its members have an important role to play in making this a reality. ...The proposed international standards for blockchain will focus on technical solutions that promote interoperability, and compatibility between existing systems. This will allow the technology to be more widely used and deployed.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Is a Standard\nAs the \u201cinvisible ships\u201d lore (or myth) goes: Native Americans could not perceive the fleet of ships about to invade their homeland because the armada was so alien to their collective experiences that they were unable to see their aggressors. One could make a similar comparison with groups seeking to standardize blockchains. Public blockchains such as Bitcoin or Ethereum are in and of themselves protocols or standards. \u00a0Institutions that are trying to (re)define what a blockchain is in the name of standardization are trying to co-opt the technology and may not even realize that they are staring at a standard. \u00a0A blockchain with(in) a layer of standards is a paradox. This governance creates a needless metalayer of friction and complexity. However, while Bitcoin is a standard, its decentralized nature means that it has no formal structure. \u00a0That said, Bitcoin utilizes a BIP or Bitcoin Improvement Proposal as the de facto way of introducing features (via Github).\u00a0\nIn fact, BIP 123, or \u201cBIP Classification\u201d created by Bitcoin Core Developer Eric Lombrozo explains that:\n\n\u201cBitcoin is a system involving a number of different standards. Some standards are absolute requirements for interoperability while others can be considered optional, giving implementors a choice of whether to support them. In order to have a BIP process which more closely reflects the interoperability requirements, it is necessary to categorize BIPs. \u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\nA Chip Off the Old Blockchain?\nBitcoin is no stranger to ISO or standardization for that matter. Back in 2014, Jon Matonis, then the executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, penned an article for CoinDesk \u201cWhy Bitcoin Needs an ISO-Certified Currency Code.\u201d The Bitcoin Foundation for its part was founded with standardization in its vision. \u00a0According to its words at the time, \u201c[The] Bitcoin Foundation standardizes, protects and promotes the use of Bitcoin cryptographic money for the benefit of users worldwide.\u201d \u00a0\nBitcoin Magazine spoke with Manu Sporny, chairman of the W3C Web Payments Community Group and CEO of Digital Bazaar. The W3C or The World Wide Web Consortium is the international standards organization for the World Wide Web. When calling Bitcoin a standard Sporny said:\n\n\u201cIt depends on if you are talking about \u2018de jure\u2019 standards or \u2018de facto\u2019 standards. Bitcoin could be argued to be a \u2018de facto\u2019 standard, but even that argument is a bit weak since systems like Ethereum exist. When you have a standard, you're looking for true interoperability. That is, multiple companies can follow the standard and come up with systems that interoperate. The Web is a good example of a set of interoperable standards. Bitcoin hasn't hit that point yet, as much of the control over the core of Bitcoin is in the hands of very few developers and one major reference implementation. I think it's shaky to call Bitcoin a standard. It's a really interesting experiment.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Sporny notes that W3C has a Blockchain standardization workshop, Blockchains and the Web: A W3C Workshop on Distributed Ledgers on the Web scheduled on June 29\u201330 at MIT Media Lab. \u00a0\nDown Under\nThe Australian proposal mentions leveraging pre-existing standards such as ISO 20022 which \u201cdefines the fields and controls within messages and transaction between entities thus allowing interoperability.\u201d However, this was on the heels of Reuters'\u00a0news\u00a0story that hackers compromised the SWIFT software of Bangladesh Bank.\u00a0\nWhile Standards Australia notes that, \u201cThe work will exclude legal obligations and regulatory matters addressed by government jurisdictions,\u201d it also proposes to \u201cEmbed compliance to money laundering and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements.\u201d\nStakeholders\nThe proposal is just one of many blockchain land grabs by legacy actors trying to stay relevant in a world of Bitcoin governance. This proposal aims to \u201cposition ISO as a leading contributor to develop global solutions to facilitate data movement and information flows thus enabling more efficient and timely transactions\u201d by establishing blockchain standards.\nAccording to Standards Australia it is consulting with stakeholders on this proposal and intends to spearhead the ISO work if approved. For more information or to make a submission, contact Varant Meguerditchian (varant.meguerditchian@standards.org.au) by June 19.\nANSI asks that comments are submitted to Steve Cornish (scornish@ansi.org), ANSI senior director of international policy, by June 3. Based on this feedback, the ANSI ISO Council will determine ANSI\u2019s position, and comments should be submitted to ISO before its July 14 voting deadline.\u00a0\nEditor's Note: This is an opinion piece by Brian Cohen and the opinions represented are those of the author.", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 25}

The project's open-source code is available on GitHub.\nThe NSD, a member of the Moscow Exchange, is a Russian nonbanking credit organization, Russia\u2019s central depository and a professional securities market player. The organization provides depository, banking settlement and relevant services to market players.\n\u201cOver the past ten years, the global financial infrastructure has faced the challenges that make us review the approaches to reliability, security and performance of information systems,\u201d said Eddie Astanin, chairman of the executive board at NSD. \u201cIt is obvious for us that ignoring the rapid development of fintech and upgrading the outdated platforms could hinder the stable development of the Russian financial system. Fortunately, Russian specialists are among the most experienced in the global fintech industry, and we have proven this fact by implementing a fully functional prototype of e-proxy voting system based on blockchain. After testing blockchain for bondholder meetings, we can extend the use of this technology to other business areas of NSD.\"\nE-proxy voting is an innovative technology for corporate actions processing that provides for electronic interaction between securities holders and issuers for the purpose of exchanging information and documents. E-proxy technology was introduced at NSD in August 2014. In April 2015, NSD upgraded the technology, bringing it in line with global ISO standards. In April 2016, a blockchain-based prototype of e-proxy voting was successfully tested for bondholder meetings.\n\"After our work group analyzed the use of blockchain in several areas of NSD activities, we opted for the automation of the voting process at the annual securities holders meetings,\u201d said Sergey Putyatinskiy, IT Director at NSD. \u201cOver the period of four months, we managed to develop a working prototype of the blockchain-based e-proxy voting system that has no analogs in the world. During the testing process, we reached a submission speed of 80 voting instructions per second. We are currently aiming to increase the system's capacity and to enable the support of new voting types. Our next step would be to subject our new prototype to legal and cryptographic expert evaluation, which will give us a more definite idea whether the prototype is suited for real voting.\"\nThe NSD has developed the e-voting system in partnership with DSX Technologies, a distributed ledger technology company based in the U.K., operating a technology stack that enables clients to prototype, test and implement complex and scalable blockchain solutions securely and in the minimum timeframe. The company, which has developed and operates an FCA-regulated environment to trade and manage digital currencies, sees big opportunities in building customized distributed ledger solutions that establish trust, accountability and transparency while streamlining business processes.\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Alex Yakovlev, head of decentralized solutions at NSD, and Mike Rymanov, founder and CEO of DSX Technologies, to find out more about their innovative e-voting system.\u00a0\n\u201cThe short-term goal is to execute a pilot voting,\u201d said Yakovlev. \u201cThat will require us to perform security assessment and do integration with existing systems. As a result of this exercise we will understand the potential of blockchain adoption by market participants and measure their trust in case of using our solution. Use of the blockchain technology in the e-proxy voting changes the business process of the voting itself. And now a group of experts including NSDs and external experts are analyzing current legislation, [to determine] exactly what changes should be done to create a legal basis for the new solution. Although the final decision is up to the regulator.\u201d\nYakovlev added that the NSD received several expressions of interest to test the e-voting system from the central securities depositories of other Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries, as well as from some major banks. \u201cIt is an open-sourced solution and we're open for discussions about making cooperative projects based on our results,\u201d said Yakovlev.\nRymanov explained the operations of the e-proxy voting system with the diagram below, where:\n\nBondholder passes a vote to a nominal bondholder (NB)\nNominal bondholder submits a vote to the blockchain\nCounting commission counts the votes and submits the results to the blockchain\nBondholder can verify whether the votes have been counted correctly.\n\n\nRymanov is persuaded that e-proxy voting could find applications in wider contexts, potentially including political elections.\n\u201cThe technology we have developed can potentially be used for general elections, providing transparency and enabling significant savings,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, the question that remains to be answered is how to negate the risk of votes being sold.\u201d\nRymanov explained that the NSD\u2019s e-proxy voting proof-of-concept (PoC) project specifications required setting up a private permissioned blockchain where every node participating in the network is known, and included a number of specific challenges related to processing capacity and permission-based access to the data. According to Rymanov, other blockchain technologies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum couldn\u2019t meet the project\u2019s requirements with an out-of-the-box solution, which motivated the choice of the NXT platform.\n\u201cUsing the proof-of-work (PoW) Bitcoin blockchain would have potentially created a situation where a particular node with a superior computing power could gain an unfair advantage over its peers, thus jeopardizing the security of the network and, if being a malicious actor, could rig the results of the vote,\u201d said Rymanov. \u201cFurthermore, we see PoW systems as an unnecessary drain on resources in private permissioned blockchains.\u201d\n\u201cWith regards to Ethereum, our team has been in touch with the Ethereum core developers and has been informed that the current limit on processing is around 60 transactions per second,\u201d added Rymanov. \u201cHowever, even though Ethereum offered a huge improvement both in functionality and processing speed over Bitcoin blockchain, it did not match the NSD requirements.\u201d\n\u201cAfter a careful consideration we have selected NXT,\u201d Rymanov said. \u201cThe proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain has provided us with enough flexibility to architect a solution that is scalable, stable and with processing capabilities well in the range of NSD expectations. In the lab environment we have pushed DSX fork of NXT to process up to 800 transactions per second. With the custom developed e-proxy voting module running on top of the NXT fork we have stabilized the system at 80 votes per second, which is 160 transactions per second reaching a notable result in line with NSD expectations.\u201d\nRymanov explained that DSX Technologies won the NSD contract in February.\u00a0\n\u201cAt that time blockchains such as Hyperledger or Chain had not been released yet, and because of the tight deadlines our team had to make a decision on the technology we could use that was well relatively developed and could accommodate complex business and technical requirements as well as be scalable and open source,\u201d he said. However, Rymanov explained, \u201cthe e-proxy voting technology we have developed is blockchain agnostic and can be easily adapted to other distributed ledger technologies that satisfy both security and processing standards.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 25}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nAlthough there has been some serious, public drama over scaling in the Bitcoin community for over a year, it appears that the community is mostly unified behind a single plan going forward, which is based on the \u201cBitcoin Roundtable Consensus.\u201d There are still high-profile individuals, such as former Bitcoin Core lead maintainer Gavin Andresen and longtime Bitcoin angel investor Roger Ver, who would like to see an increase in the block size limit as soon as possible.\nSupport for Bitcoin Classic, which intends to deploy a block size limit increase to 2 megabytes via a hard fork, currently sits around 5 percent of the network hashrate, and representatives from the vast majority of Bitcoin miners and mining pools have no intention of breaking the previous agreement to run only Bitcoin Core software for the foreseeable future.\nBitcoin Magazine recently chatted with Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu about his current thoughts on Segregated Witness (SegWit), hard forks and the recent Beijing meeting between BIP 109 supporters and the Chinese Bitcoin mining industry. Bitmain runs one of the top two Bitcoin mining pools in the world, Antpool. The pool accounted for roughly 22 percent of all mined blocks over the four days prior to publication.\nComments on the Beijing Meeting\nBitcoin Magazine previously reported on a somewhat secretive meeting in Beijing that took place near the end of March. BTCC COO Samson Mow referred to the meeting as a \u201ctrain wreck,\u201d which is a description that some, such as Roger Ver, found to be inaccurate.\nWhen asked if he would refer to the meeting as a train wreck, Wu responded, \u201cIt depends how you define \u2018train wreck.\u2019 If it describes the status that no agreement [was] reached, it is a \u2018yes.\u2019\u201d\nWu went on to clarify that an agreement, like the one made in Hong Kong, was not the purpose of the Beijing meeting (in his view). He explained:\n\n\u201cWe discussed lots of potential solutions around the scaling issues and debated possible problems with those ideas. As there is no intention to corner anyone into any promise, everyone feels free to discuss all possible ways of future actions. The meeting let everyone know about the position of each other very well.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he thinks the Bitcoin Core roadmap is sufficient, Wu responded, \u201cIf (a soon and big enough) block size limit increase does [become] a part of the scaling roadmap, and the Lightning Network is ready soon enough, I think it will be sufficient for at least a few years from now.\u201d\nAntpool Will Not Run Bitcoin Classic, May Delay SegWit\nDuring his conversation with Bitcoin Magazine, Wu confirmed that Antpool is testing Segregated Witness (SegWit) right now, and the mining pool will not be running Bitcoin Classic in a production environment for the foreseeable future. Wu added that Bitmain is honoring the Hong Kong agreement, \u201ceven though lots of people think that SegWit is not \u2018released\u2019 as there is only a pull request.\u201d\nIt should be clarified that there was no explicit promise to release Segregated Witness by April in the Hong Kong agreement. Having said that, Wu put the agreement in the following context:\n\n\u201cThe context is that SegWit will be released in a very timely manner to address the block size scarcity problems in the near future. The China Bitcoin community side, including exchanges, wallets and miners, [are] concerned very much about the short-term problem. [The] SegWit release date was repetitively stated as in April. So delay of SegWit is a problem, though most of the parties will understand this problem and continue to act in good faith.\u201d\n\nWu also shared his views on whether the current state of Segregated Witness can be viewed as a true release:\n\n\u201cBy \u2018release,\u2019 it should be always a functioning, well-tested binary software that can let people to run safely in good faith. A code which is not merged, not tested, not agreed by their decision community is not a \u2018release.\u2019 There are several \u2018release[s]\u2019 in the agreement, and every \u2018release\u2019 has the same implication or meaning.\u201d\n\nBefore running Segregated Witness code in a production environment, Wu would like to see the hard fork code discussed in the Hong Kong agreement implemented in a release of Bitcoin Core. Wu explained:\n\u201cWe are waiting for the July hard fork code promised in the February Hong Kong meeting. We and other mining pools will want to talk to Core again after the hard fork code is public before we take next steps.\u201d\nWhen asked specifically whether Antpool would run SegWit code without a hard fork increase in the block size also included in a release of Bitcoin Core, Wu responded:\n\n\u201cNo. It is acceptable that the hard fork code is not activated, but it needs to be included in a \u2018release\u2019 of Bitcoin Core. I have made it clear about the definition of \u2018release,\u2019 which is not \u2018public.\u2019\u201d\n\nSome of the Bitcoin Core contributors who signed the Hong Kong agreement recently met in New York to discuss what should be in the proposed hard fork. The details of the proposed hard fork are expected to be known soon, and a thread on the Bitcoin development mailing list indicates a way to block the ASICBoost proposal has been discussed.\nIn the current environment, developers expect that an increase to the block size limit via a hard fork is unlikely to be merged into Bitcoin Core. Having said that, Bitcoin Core contributor and spokesperson Eric Lombrozo told Bitcoin Magazine that an increase via a soft fork is a possibility. Increases via a soft fork, such as extension blocks, have been discussed in the past.\nIt should be noted that Segregated Witness is also, effectively, an increase in the block size limit to roughly 1.7 megabytes. Schnorr signatures is another optimization that would allow more transactions to fit in each block.\nIn Lombrozo\u2019s view, hard forks should not be deployed under political pressure while animosity still exists between different segments of the community.\nIn the context of Antpool\u2019s current views on scaling, the lack of a hard fork deployment in Bitcoin Core could delay the activation of a Segregated Witness soft fork.\nWu:\u00a0A Hard Fork is Still Needed\nWhile Bitmain is sticking with the Hong Kong agreement, Jihan Wu is worried whether Bitcoin Core will implement an increase to the block size limit. He noted the possibility of a \u201cdisaster\u201d if the block size limit is not increased that would be caused by transaction delays and fee increases, but he understands that the Bitcoin Core contributors who attended the Hong Kong meeting cannot speak for those who were not there.\nWu noted that block space has a perfectly inelastic supply, which he noted is an economic term that is not often applied to the real world. He added, \u201cI really don't want the whole community to experience serious problems as a consequence of making [the] wrong choice.\u201d\nWu did mention that Blockstream President Adam Back\u2019s recent presentation at Paralelni Polis was a positive sign. He stated:\n\n\u201cThe [recent] presentation by Adam Back for Slush showed that they have been taking the block size increase problem into serious consideration. It is a positive sign. We hope that the Core community members, especially those who have veto rights in their decision-making process, can realize the [importance of] increases [in] the main block size.\u201d\n\nIn terms of when a block size limit increase is needed, Wu added:\n\n\u201cWe need to do it fast. The block size increase is, after all, a short term solution for emergency problems. Delaying to increase the block size will bring lots of problems, which mostly become the pain of Bitcoin enterprises such as exchanges and wallets.\u201d\n\nTo illustrate \u00a0his concern regarding the need for more block space, Wu shared a question asked by HaoBTC CEO Wu Gang during the Hong Kong meeting in February. Wu paraphrased:\n\u201cLots of on-chain transactions pop up now. The demand for Bitcoin transactions is higher and higher. What if SegWit and the Lighting Network cannot be ready and adaptive to the demand soon enough? Will we just ask the users to wait until we have finished the SegWit soft fork and Lightning Network?\u201d\nWu added that Gang\u2019s question was not answered.\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd to get an answer to Gang\u2019s question:\n\n\u201cUnfortunately Bitcoin simply doesn't scale well, so we don't have any easy way to respond to increased demand other than the fee market; block size can be bumped, but that increases centralization. The fee market does mean that the lowest valued transactions get priced out of the market, but now that fee estimation is widely supported, and wallets are beginning to add support for\u00a0replace-by-fee fee bumping, we do have good mechanisms for users to outbid those lowest valued transactions and keep using Bitcoin. This isn't a great answer I agree, but there's not much more we can do without fundamental improvements to Bitcoin's scalability.\u201d\n", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 23}

Sam Palmisano, former CEO of IBM, is the commission\u2019s vice-chair.\nPresident Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13718 to establish the commission in February. The executive order tasked the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to provide the commission with such expertise, services, funds, facilities, staff, equipment and other support services necessary to carry out its mission.\n\u201cThe Commission will make detailed short-term and long-term recommendations to strengthen cybersecurity in both the public and private sectors, while protecting privacy, ensuring public safety and economic and national security, fostering discovery and development of new technical solutions, and bolstering partnerships between federal, state and local government and the private sector in the development, promotion and use of cybersecurity technologies, policies and best practices,\u201d notes the official commission website at NIST.\nThe commission held an open meeting on May 16 in New York City. Cuomo\u2019s statement, which appears in the Panelist Statements document issued by the commission, is republished in the IBM Think blog with the title \u201cBlockchain: Securing the Financial Systems of the Future.\u201d\nCuomo noted that 80 years ago a public-private partnership between the U.S. government and IBM created the Social Security system, which was the most advanced financial system of the time. \u201cToday, as financial transactions become increasingly digital and networked, government and industry must once again combine forces to make the financial systems of the future more efficient, effective and secure than those of the past,\u201d he said.\nA similar partnership between government and industry, centered on innovative applications of distributed ledger technology, could enhance national security. Cuomo is persuaded that the government has a key role to play in funding blockchain research and providing official identity certification services for the emergent blockchain economy. In particular, according to the IBM executive, the NIST should define standards for interoperability, privacy and security, and government agencies should become early adopters of blockchain applications.\nCuomo identifies four key priority areas for government-supported developments in distributed ledger technology for national security: a new identity management system able to provide robust proof of identity; automatic systems able to track changes made to data and verify data provenance with time stamps and annotations; secure transaction processing; and a blockchain-based system to securely and confidentially share intelligence on cyber-threats and cyber-terrorism.\n\u201cWe need to create a new social compact, where business, with input from government, architects the future of financial services,\u201d concluded Cuomo. \u201cWe at IBM look forward to working with our partners in government, industry and academia to get this done.\u201d\nOf course, Cuomo defended IBM\u2019s positions on current distributed ledger issues and development prospects. After bashing the \u201cpublic enemy\u201d Bitcoin for its openness, anarchy and potential for anonymity, Cuomo defended the \u201cpermissioned blockchain\u201d approach favored by IBM and other major industry players.\n\u201cBlockchain came to prominence because it\u2019s the core technology underlying the infamous Bitcoin cryptocurrency, but, while Bitcoin is an anonymous network, industries and government agencies are exploring the use of blockchain in networks where the participants are known,\u201d said Cuomo. \u201cWe call this a \u2018permissioned blockchain.\u2019\u201d\nIBM is a premier member of Linux Foundation\u2019s Hyperledger Project, a collaborative effort started in December to establish, build and sustain an open \u2012 but \u201cpermissioned\u201d \u2012 non-Bitcoin blockchain. In February, Bitcoin Magazine reported that IBM is making tens of thousands of lines of code available to the Hyperledger Project. In April, IBM announced new cloud services based on the company\u2019s Hyperledger code and Bluemix, IBM\u2019s cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS).\n\u201cIBM is playing a central role in the development of a permissioned blockchain,\u201d said Cuomo. \u201cWe\u2019re a founding member of the Linux Foundation\u2019s open-source Hyperledger Project, where we\u2019re helping to build the foundational elements of business-ready blockchain architecture with a focus on privacy, confidentiality and auditability. \u00a0We have joined consortia that are developing industry-specific blockchain implementations.

It is an encouraging time for those hopeful about Bitcoin and other open blockchain-based systems, but many high-level decision-makers still must be persuaded of this technology's global impact.\nThe United States seems to be doing fine in the aftermath of 2008\u2019s Great Recession. Despite technological change causing some workforce pain, the U.S. economy is doing well.\nBut other parts of the world are still feeling some nasty economic aftereffects. Some might say this is due to colorful central banking policies. One of these policies is negative interest rates imposed by various central banks around the world.\nThe idea of negative interest rate policy becoming normal is concerning, as this could set a dangerous precedent for the global economy. At the same time, it provides an opportunity for alternatives to thrive. Negative interest rates could actually influence enormous growth for cryptographically backed open blockchain assets.\nNegative Interest Rate Problems\nSweden, Switzerland and Japan are among countries currently enforcing negative interest rate policies. Negative interest rates, which essentially charge savers a fee to put their money in a bank, are set to induce borrowing to stimulate a sagging economy. They are also a reason for central banks to print more cash, popularly known as quantitative easing.\nOver time, negative interest rate policy results in bank holdings being worth less. Therefore, it is arguable that this is not really a solution, but a stopgap until something else comes along. Some have described this policy as medicine for a \u201cweak patient.\u201d This refers to the concept that negative interest rates can\u2019t heal what has already been broken for too long.\n\nEurope has become a popular place for negative interest rates.\nNegative interest rate policy forces people to look for alternatives and creates a need for services that can reflect growth rather than contraction. Retail banking relies on everyone storing cash in bank accounts, but in a negative interest rate world, people are better off borrowing money than they are saving.\nIn the standard fractional reserve environment, banks rely on savings to lend. Yet holding cash, for most people, is actually more lucrative in a negative interest rate environment. Even when factoring in inflation, there is long-term value in holding cash rather than putting it in a bank imposing a negative interest rate. But physical cash can be tough to hold because of security and storage issues.\nMany countries believe negative interest rates are a benefit to their economies. The common mindset is that these policies are staving off even more economic problems. Distributed blockchain-based assets are clearly an attractive option in this scenario.\nChoices Over Traditional Assets\nAs an early stage technology, Bitcoin and open blockchain are in growth mode. This is especially true since it\u2019s not clear what long-term impact negative interest rates will have on banking. People seeking financial alternatives should be aware that there are options over traditional assets.\nBitcoin is no longer the only viable open digital currency option, with platforms such as Ethereum also offering a promising choice. With impressive performance metrics and many developers working on Ethereum projects, that choice benefits everyone. The back-end of open blockchain tech is looking more promising than ever.\n\nEthereum, with 14-second block times, is an attractive alternative to BTC.\nThe price of Bitcoin has been performing well as a store of value. Ethereum\u2019s price performance in 2016 has been remarkable, and the fiat-to-open-blockchain exchange infrastructure around the world continues to improve.\nBecause of these factors, there has never been a better time to invest in and use cryptographically backed open assets. Companies such as Circle, Abra and Lawnmower are making it easier to use borderless forms of money. These startups offer a solid premise: open banking, done entirely on a digital device.\nOpen digital assets could provide a salvo from economic problems like negative interest rates. They can be an alternative to less transparent cash-based systems. However, there is still work to be done. This growing ecosystem still requires understanding by influential leaders to achieve widespread success.\nChampioning Bitcoin and Blockchain\nGiven the growth of Bitcoin and blockchain, new application platforms will emerge from these technologies. Global economic conditions resulting in negative interest rates certainly provide some motivation for this. But there are still obstacles to overcome for open blockchain platforms to succeed.\nIn Steve Case\u2019s new book, The Third Wave, the AOL cofounder discusses today\u2019s era of technology. In the \u201cthird wave,\u201d current technological entrepreneurs must work to champion Bitcoin and blockchain to global leaders. This is similar to the work Case had to do at AOL in the 1990s, where he fought hard to convince regulators that the Internet would become an enormous economic opportunity.\nToday, entrepreneurs must educate about the importance of Bitcoin and open blockchain. This means promoting it as an engine of economic growth and financial inclusion.\nThe challenge today is convincing others that this open technology is needed in economic systems. That will take dedication to developing inventive applications to solve global economic problems.\nTransparency, combined with tools such as programmable agreements, ranks among the most exciting characteristics of open blockchain assets. As such, these assets should be considered highly impactful to the future of the global economy. In the case of negative interest rate policies, it is obvious that new solutions to economic problems are necessary.\nBitcoin, Ethereum and other open blockchain systems now exist to help make that happen.\nEditor's note: \u00a0This is a guest post by Daniel Cawrey and the opinions offered are those of the author.", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 27}
{"title": "Blockchain Technology Will Profoundly Change the Derivatives Industry", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/blockchain-technology-will-profoundly-change-the-derivatives-industry-1464368431/", "birthday": "May 27, 2016  1:00 PM EST", "date": "2016-05-27 18:00:00", "content": "Editor's note: This is a guest post by Matt O\u2019Brien and the opinions represented are those of the author.\nAs the hype and pessimism around blockchain technology converge toward reality over the next several years, one certainty emerging among Wall Street and Main Street traders is that advancements in platform technology will profoundly change how commonly used securities known as derivative contracts will be traded. The distributed ledgers inconceivable just a couple of years ago are on the precipice of ushering in a new era of innovative financial engineering and precision in risk management.\nWall Street firms are beginning to tinker with blockchain and smart contract technology that will allow buyers, sellers and central clearing houses of derivative trades to share information, such as KYC (Know Your Customer), in real time across various distributed ledger platforms unleashing incredible efficiencies.\nLast month it was reported that Barclays tested a blockchain platform called Corda, developed by the bank consortium R3. Electronic documents that served as derivative contracts were pre-populated with standardized values, which, one day, will allow the contracts to be hashed out between counterparties, traded on an exchange across multiple banks and then cleared and settled instantaneously. \u00a0\nDerivative contracts are financial instruments that derive their value from some underlying asset, such as stocks, bonds, commodities or even interest rates. Derivative contracts have become increasingly fundamental in effectively managing financial risk and creating synthetic exposures to asset classes. For example, airlines use future contracts, a form of derivative, to hedge against fluctuating oil prices. Hedge funds use options, another form of derivatives, to speculate in questionable company stock without baring the cost of purchasing a large number of shares. Derivative contracts typically have shelf lives of 30-day increments.\nIndustry leaders expect distributed ledger infrastructure to foster new approaches to financial engineering, enabling financiers to customize derivatives consisting of individual cash flows to meet precise needs in terms of timing and credit risk. According to a report produced by Oliver Wyman, a management consulting firm, blockchain-enabled derivative contracts could be financed by issuers selling their own instruments that match the cash flows they expect to achieve, \u201cin essence creating swaps without the need for balance sheet intermediation.\u201d Traditional swap agreements are traded over the counter.\nSmart derivative contracts will spell out each party\u2019s obligation such as margin agreements and swap conditions. Traditionally, financial exchanges have required clearing houses to provide a guarantee to the winning party of the derivative contract in case the loser does not pay. The clearing house is able to provide this guarantee by requiring both parties to make cash deposits during the pre-trade phase.\nWhile one of the original goals of blockchain technology is to remove the need for central governing bodies, industry analysts reason traders will continue to novate derivative trades via a Counterparty Clearing House (CCP) in order for dealers to net their exposures and monitor the financial well-being of counterparties (ensuring problems like double-spending are eliminated). Blockchain vendors, such as kompany.com, can supply banks with customer and company information for due diligence. On May 12, at an industry conference, kompany.com announced its development of electronic ledgers with original and authoritative company information and that it is moving information on 100 million firms onto a blockchain for KYC and Know Your Bank documentation.\nIn the age of blockchain, dealers will post collateral to the clearing house in the form of initial and variation margin by escrowing cash on a distributed cash ledger or by allocating assets held on other asset ledgers to a distributed collateral ledger. Smart derivative contracts that bind both seller and buyer will be stored on a distributed derivative ledger along with information from the cash and asset ledgers. This will lead to efficiencies for calculating derivative positions and obligations.\n\u201cThe smart contract can automatically compute exposures by referencing agreed external data sources (e.g. S&P; 500, NASDAQ) that recalculate variation margin. Interoperable derivative and collateral ledgers would automatically allow the contract to call additional collateral units on asset ledgers to support these needs. At maturity, a final net obligation is computed by the smart contract, and a payment instruction automatically generated in the cash ledger, closing out the deal,\u201d the\u00a0authors of the report state. With regard to the settlement of funds, presently the interbank transfer system entails a three to five day process that includes the Automated Clearing House and Federal Reserve as clearing agent. This represents a significant opportunity cost that parties can recapture with a real-time system.\nProponents of blockchain technology see the improvement in funds settlement and counterparty risk assessment as shortening the liquidity cycle for various derivative positions, allowing financiers to inject liquidity into the system for other transactions much more quickly. \u201cIn order to maintain liquidity levels firms have to overcompensate where the money has to be tied up for some time before the next transaction,\u201d said Derick Smith, Cofounder and CEO of Chainreactor. \u201cTransaction time will improve and risk assessment will improve. Most other players will get to see who they are providing liquidity for.\u201d\nIndustry executives figure cost savings can come from eliminating redundant IT systems and trading and risk management overhead. The finance industry currently spends roughly $150 billion annually on IT and operations expenditures in addition to $100 billion on post-trade and securities servicing fees.\nSome media outlets have reported that many Wall Street firms have increased capital budget allocations to blockchain technology initiatives. JPMorgan plans to increase its overall technology spending to approximately $9.4 billion this year while allocating about 40 percent of that budget to new investments and technologies, up from 30 percent.\nWhile private blockchain systems continue to develop they remain closed to the trading public. A public blockchain currently available on the web is Ether Opt, which is a decentralized options exchange built on Ethereum. The website claims that options traded on its platform are vanilla call and put options priced in an Ether/USD exchange rate. Cryptocurrency exchanges Poloniex and Coindesk provide pricing information. The open-source platform is produced by Etherboost, which is a producer of decentralized autonomous organizations governed by smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. According to Etherboost\u2019s website developers also created Ethvertise, an ad market, SzaboDice, a dice game, and Pokereth, a poker game.\nIn early April, Etherboost programmers blogged that \u201cthe first Etheropt expiration was successful. The transaction. \u2026 represents the first decentralized options expiration in the history of mankind.\u201d\nPhone calls seeking comment for\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine were not returned before publication.\nDespite all the fervor around blockchain and smart contract technology, many challenges still exist. Some experts estimate the new systems will be fully implemented within a decade. The well documented challenge of scalability continues to hamper progress. \u201cLooking at Bitcoin from an architectural perspective it can at this point handle only seven transactions per second,\u201d said Mr. Smith. \u201cThe issue is verifiability of each transaction where people have to wait for the global network to verify it.\u201d\nCME Group literature states exchange-listed derivative contracts volume averaged 15.6 million per day in 2015. The CME is the largest exchange of derivative contracts in the world. Mr. Smith added that the public blockchain platform Ethereum with its programmable transaction functionality will, in time, overcome scalability issues.\nOfficials with CME Group did not respond when reached for comment, however, they referred Bitcoin Magazine to a May 2 press release about the exchange\u2019s latest initiative in collaboration with Crypto Facilities, a digital assets trading platform, for launching the Bitcoin Reference Rate and Real-Time Index.\nRegarding digital currencies, the token unit of the Ethereum platform is ether, which is used to pay for computational services on the Ethereum network. Financial firms see the digital currency as a challenge because it is perceived as lacking stability. Fiat currency would prove problematic because blockchain technology treats it as another asset class on a distributed ledger. The authors of the Oliver Wyman report suggest banks create specific digital currencies for interbank use or use existing accounts at banks where participants deposit liquidity for trading in segregated accounts.\nPhoto\u00a0Liz Bustamante\u00a0/ Flickr(CC)", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 27}

That and the strengthening U.S. dollar prompted the People's Bank of China to devalue the yuan by 0.45 percent last Friday to its lowest level since February 2011.\nNew Interest in Bitcoin\nHuobi and OKCoin, the two largest Chinese exchanges\u00a0that now account for some 92 percent of Bitcoin global trading by (self-reported) volume, both reported almost double the usual trading volume over the past weekend.\u00a0BTCC, China's third largest exchange, also reported a surge in bitcoin trading volume, setting a new record on its Pro Exchange.\nOKCoin\u2019s Jack Liu, Chief Strategy Officer, confirmed the surge in trading volume and told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n\"After two long years, Bitcoin\u2019s price crossed back across the USD $500 mark led by OKCoin's CNY exchange - the largest digital asset trading platform in the world. The price first reached $500 on May 28, and was followed later on by OKCoin's USD exchange and other global platforms such as Coinbase.\u201d\n\n\u00a0Huobi\u2019s CEO Leon Li said that trading volume on their exchange has doubled in the last few days as investors look for a safe haven:\n\n\u201cWe do think that China's economic situation has certain influence to the price. Totally, RMB has been on the trend of depreciation for a long time, and the domestic stock market has been weak since last September. More and more Chinese investors and their hot money need a new investment market, and a convenient alternative investment like Bitcoin is easy to be accepted by the traders.\u201d\n\nBobby Lee, CEO of BTCC exchange told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n\"BTCC has seen very high trading volumes this past weekend. In fact, on our Pro Exchange, we saw record volumes on Friday, the highest ever since our launch last October. This recent rally was indeed led by the China market, which gives credit to the theory that people were predicting today's yuan devaluation.\"\n\nJack Liu believes that China\u2019s economic situation is in for a long period of flat or stagnant growth.\n\n\u00a0\u201cWe believe with the Chinese economy is entering into a \u201cL-shaped\u201d recovery rather than a \"U-shaped\" one; the dearth of mainstream, prudent investment choices has made Bitcoin a relatively attractive choice.\u201d\n\nHowever Huobi\u2019s Leon Li told us that he sees more than just these short-term economic factors in explaining the growing popularity of Bitcoin:\n\u201cThe policy environment has been more and more tolerant worldwide, and blockchain technology has been acknowledged by academic and traditional financial institutions. Even People's Bank of China (China's central bank) is discussing blockchain. In the long term, when the price returns to rationality, it would vibrate by those fundamentals.\u201d\u00a0\nBitcoin Halving in July Seen as a Possible Cause of Price Increase\nBoth Jack Liu and Leon Li see the upcoming halving as a significant factor in the increase in the price of Bitcoin. \u00a0Liu told us:\n\u201cThis is especially in light of the fact that the Bitcoin supply will be halved in just over a month, adding to deflationary supply pressures and increasing the digital asset's investment value in the short, and long term.\u201d\nBitcoin Continuing a Steady Increase in Price and Market Capitalization\nAs noted in this recent Bitcoin Magazine article about the price of Bitcoin, the digital currency is showing a steady and almost methodical ascent, with moderate increases in both price and market capitalization.\nIt appears that China\u2019s bad fortune is good for Bitcoin, although Jack Liu notes that economic uncertainty is not just limited to China. He told us:\n\u201cIt was not a surprise to see the upturn. After all, the whole world is facing slower growth and low to negative interest rates, not just China.\"", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 31}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe Lightning Network is probably the most highly anticipated technological innovation to be deployed on top of Bitcoin. The payment layer, first proposed by Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja about a year ago, promises to support a virtually unlimited number of off-chain transactions among users, at nearly no cost \u2013 while leveraging the security offered by Bitcoin.\nAt least three companies \u2013 Poon and Dryja's\u00a0Lightning,\u00a0Blockstream\u00a0and\u00a0Blockchain\u00a0\u2013 are currently working on implementations of the technology. But few outside this small technological frontline fully grasp how the \u201cfuture of micropayments\u201d is set to boost Bitcoin\u2019s capabilities.\nIn this three-part series,\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine\u00a0lays out the basic building blocks of the Lightning Network, and shows how they fit together to realize this upcoming protocol layer.\nThis first part of the series establishes the necessary building blocks, and shows how these can be combined to create \u201csmart contracts,\u201d which can be applied to realize the first requirement of the Lightning Network: a bidirectional payment channel.\n(Note: Anyone with a solid understanding of Bitcoin can skip the building blocks.)\nBuilding Block #1: Unconfirmed Transactions\nAt its heart, the Bitcoin protocol consists of transactions, that are typically linked to previous transactions, and potentially to future transactions. Each transaction contains\u00a0inputs, which refer to addresses bitcoins are sent\u00a0from, and\u00a0outputs, which refer to addresses bitcoins are sent\u00a0to. Additionally, inputs must include the requirements to send the bitcoins, like signatures that prove \u201cownership\u201d of the input-addresses. Outputs, meanwhile, establish the new requirements, that must be included in the input of a\u00a0subsequent\u00a0transaction.\nAs one of its key features, the Lightning Network is built up from more or less regular Bitcoin transactions. It's just that these transactions are typically not actually broadcast over the Bitcoin network. Instead, they are stored locally, on the nodes of users - but they can be broadcast over the network at any time.\n\nBuilding Block #2: Double-Spend Protection\nThe second building block for the Lightning Network probably doesn't require much explaining, as it's arguably the\u00a0raison d'\u00eatre\u00a0for Bitcoin itself: double-spend protection. If two transactions (or: inputs) rely on the same output, only one can confirm.\nThe important thing to keep in mind here is that even unconfirmed transactions can be conflicting, meaning only one can ever confirm.\n\nBuilding Block #3: Multisig\nThe third building block of the Lightning Network is also a straightforward one: multisignature (multisig) addresses. (Or more generally: P2SH-addresses.)\nMultisig addresses are Bitcoin addresses that \u2013 as the name suggests - require multiple private keys to \u201cunlock\u201d and spend bitcoins from. Multisig addresses can be set up under all sorts of conditions. For instance to require two out of three possible keys, or fifteen out of fifteen, or just about any other combination.\nThe Lightning Network often uses two out of two (2-of-2) multisig set-ups. Unlocking bitcoins from 2-of-2 multisig addresses requires two signatures, from two dedicated keys.\n\nBuilding Block #4: Time-Locks\nThe fourth building block is the time-lock. Time-locks can \u201clock bitcoins up\u201d in an output, to make them spendable (to be included in a subsequent input) only at some point in the future.\nThere are two different types of time-locks: the absolute type, called CheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV), and the relative type, CheckSequenceVerify (CSV). CLTV locks bitcoins up until a (more or less) concrete time in the future: an actual time and date, or a specific block height. CSV, instead, uses relative time. Once a CVS-output is recorded on the blockchain, it takes a specific amount of blocks from\u00a0that\u00a0point on before the bitcoins can be spent again.\n\nBuilding Block #5: Hash Values and Secrets\nThe fifth and final building block \u2013 cryptography - is the most fundamental building block of Bitcoin itself. But in the Lightning Network, it\u2019s applied in a new way.\nIn short, a \u201cvalue\u201d or \u201csecret\u201d is a long and unique string of numbers that is practically impossible to guess, even for a computer with infinite tries. With a special calculation, this value (or secret) can be \u201chashed\u201d into a different string of numbers, a \u201chash.\u201d And here's the trick: anyone who knows the value can easily reproduce the hash. But this doesn't work the other way around; it's a one way street.\nThis trick can be utilized in Bitcoin itself, again to \u201clock bitcoins up.\u201d (In fact, it's really how Bitcoin works.) For example, a hash can be included in an output, and require the subsequent input to include the corresponding value in order to be spendable.\n\nThe First Challenge: Bidirectional Payment Channels\nEven before the Lightning Network was presented, the concept of\u00a0payment channels\u00a0had been around for some time. Typical payment channels are useful for certain purposes, but also limited: they are one-directional. Alice can pay Bob several off-chain transactions, but Bob cannot pay Alice through the same channel at all.\nAs a key feature of the Lightning Network, Poon and Dryja proposed trustless bidirectional payment channels.\nOpening the Channel\nTo set up a bidirectional payment channel, both parties involved must first agree on an opening transaction. This opening transaction determines how many bitcoins each deposits into the channel.\nLet's say Alice wants to send one bitcoin to Bob. Since Alice and Bob expect to transact more frequently, they decide to open up a bidirectional payment channel, and use this to send the bitcoin. (Sending a whole bitcoin is probably a lot for a payment channel, as these might be more useful for micropayments \u2013 but it's perfectly possible.)\nTo open the channel, Alice and Bob each send five bitcoins to a 2-of-2 multisig address. This is the \u201copening transaction.\u201d Bitcoins can only be spent from this address if both Alice and Bob sign a subsequent transaction.\nAdditionally, Alice and Bob both create a secret (a string of numbers), and exchange the hash.\nAlice now immediately creates a subsequent transaction from the opening transaction. This is a \u201ccommitment transaction.\u201d With the commitment transaction, Alice sends four bitcoins to herself, and six bitcoins to a second multisig address. This second multisig address is a bit funky. It can be unlocked by Bob on his own, but only after 1000 extra blocks have been mined after it\u2019s included on the blockchain; it includes a CSV-lock.\u00a0Or, it can be opened by Alice on her own, but only if she\u00a0also\u00a0includes the secret for which Bob has just now given her the hash. (Of course, Alice has no idea what this secret is \u2013 she only knows hash \u2013 so there's no way she can make use of this option right now.)\nAlice signs her end of this commitment transaction. But she doesn't broadcast it! Instead, she gives it to Bob.\nMeanwhile, Bob does the same, but mirrored. He creates a commitment transaction as well, from which he sends six bitcoins to himself, and four to a funky new multisig-address. Alice can unlock this address if she waits an additional 1000 blocks, or Bob can unlock it with Alice using her secret.\nBob signs this half, and gives it to Alice.\nAfter all this exchanging of \u201chalf-valid\u201d commitment transactions and hashes of secrets, they both sign and broadcast the opening transaction, to make sure it's recorded on the blockchain. The channel is now officially open.\nAt this point, both Alice and Bob could sign and broadcast the half-valid commitment transaction they got from the other. If Alice does, Bob gets six bitcoins immediately. If Bob does, Alice gets four bitcoins immediately. But whomever signs and broadcasts the transaction will have to wait 1000 blocks to unlock the subsequent multisig-address, and claim the remaining bitcoins.\n\nHowever, and this is the key trick of a payment channel: neither sign and broadcast their half of the transaction at all.\nUpdating the Channel\nA little later, Bob wants to send Alice one bitcoin back. They want to update the channel state, to make the balance five-five again. To accomplish this, Alice and Bob do two things.\nFirst, both repeat the process as described above (except that the opening transaction is already recorded on the blockchain; that part is skipped). This time, both Alice and Bob attribute themselves five bitcoins, and both attribute five bitcoins to funky multisig-addresses. The conditions for these multisig-addresses are similar, except that they require\u00a0new\u00a0secrets: both Alice and Bob provide each other withnew\u00a0hashes. They both sign their new half valid commitment transaction, and give it to each other.\nSecond, Alice and Bob hand each other their\u00a0first\u00a0secrets, as used in the\u00a0first\u00a0set-up.\nAt this point, again, both Alice and Bob could sign and broadcast the new \u201chalf valid\u201d commitment transaction they just got. Their counterparty would get five bitcoins immediately, while the broadcaster would have to wait 1000 blocks. As such, the channel is updated.\nBut what's stopping Bob from broadcasting the older commitment transaction instead? That commitment transaction led to a path that paid him six bitcoins, instead of five\u2026.\nWhat\u2019s stopping Bob, of course, is his first secret, which he has now given to Alice.\nBob cannot safely sign and broadcast the older commitment transaction any more, because Alice now knows Bob's first secret. If Bob were to sign and broadcast that commitment transaction, he would immediately send four bitcoins to Alice... and he would have to wait 1000 blocks to claim his own six bitcoins. That's a problem, because now that Alice knows his secret, she could use this time to beat Bob to the punch, and claim the other six bitcoins as well!\nAnd since Bob has Alice\u2019s secret too, this is just as true for the other way around. If Alice tries to sign and broadcast an old commitment transaction, Bob can steal all the bitcoins in the channel.\nThis of course means that both Alice and Bob are strongly incentivized to play fair, and only ever sign and broadcast the most recent state of the channel.\n\nNext, this bidirectional payment channel set-up needs to expand to allow payments over a network. This is covered in the second article of this series.\nThanks to Rusty Russell and Joseph Poon for added feedback.", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 31}

It echoes the concerns of former Barclays PLC Chief Executive, Antony Jenkins, who referred to the position of consumer banking as being \u201cin an Uber moment\u201d that would lead to rapidly accelerating job losses.\n\u201cI predict that the number of branches and people employed in the financial services sector may decline by as much as 50 percent over the next 10 years, and even in a less harsh scenario I expect a decline of at least 20 percent,\u201d said Jenkins in a recent speech in London.\nThe indicators of the disruption lie not only in the decrease of traditional financial services employment opportunities, but in the increase of investment in the disruptors themselves.\n\u201cIn the last four years, venture capital investment in fintech has increased more than 600 percent,\u201d reports David Shrier, managing director of MIT Connection Science and lead instructor of the university\u2019s new online fintech certificate course, Future Commerce.\nA large chunk of those drawn to fintech are the innovators with novel ideas, or those trying to find inspiration and discover that great idea to get their startup going. \u201cWith billions of dollars flowing into the industry, they\u2019re set to disrupt the business of major institutions like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and UBS. And those big companies are fighting back,\u201d says Shrier.\nNot Only the Disruptors Benefit from Disruption\nMany established institutions have, however, woken up to these opportunities and in response are pushing spending on innovation. Corporate executives and business leaders tasked with helping management understand what\u2019s going on with disruption in financial technology, or helping larger companies deal with the changing reality of financial innovation and financial technology, are also jumping on the fintech bandwagon.\nCitigroup\u2019s report indicated that, \u201cAn open question remains as to whether incumbent banks in the U.S. and Europe can embrace innovation, not just talk about blockchain and hackathons, before fintech competitors gain scale and distribution.\u201d A portion of banks have already increased IT spending, first investing heavily in digital banking and currently pouring money into accelerators, alliances and innovation labs, according to a\u00a0EY report.\nBarclays, for example, is creating a worldwide community for innovation in fintech \u2013 a plan of action that has already involved opening an accelerator program in New York\u2019s Silicon Alley.\nSo, what does it all really\u00a0mean?\nBetween the disruption created by fintech startups and the deluge of fintech-speak around areas like Bitcoin, blockchain, and the relationship between them, there\u2019s a need for well-established institutions to, at least, start by forming a fundamental understanding of what this all means for the future of their businesses.\nMIT Offers a Solution for Demystifying the Madness\n\u201cYou need to understand what\u2019s going on in this highly chaotic environment. And we can help,\u201d suggests \u00a0Shrier, who is set to lecture alongside the likes of MIT\u2019s Alex \u201cSandy\u201d Pentland,\u00a0Brian Forde and Joost Bonsen, along with a host of industry leaders.\nMIT\u2019s mandate is to advance knowledge in areas that will serve to address the 21st century\u2019s great challenges by educating students in science, technology and other fields of scholarship that will best serve the world.\nTo this end, the university is collaborating with online education company GetSmarter to deliver a 12-week online short course that will equip professionals with an understanding of the future of money, markets, transactions, commerce, security and privacy \u2013 with a focus on the disruptive technological innovations that are influencing them.\nThe online learning model used in MIT XL\u2019s courses is underpinned by a predominantly constructivist, action-learning approach to the design of online learning activities. The student is seen as an active participant in creating knowledge in collaboration with peers, and learning activities and assignments focus on engagement rather than instruction.\nBut just because you\u2019re learning online, it no longer means you\u2019re learning alone.\n\u201cWe are using new team collaboration technology developed in Sandy Pentland\u2019s research group to improve how remote project teams collaborate on a business plan, and new \u2018prediction markets\u2019 technology to run a game that harnesses wisdom of crowds to predict future securities prices,\u201d said Shrier.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had phenomenal interest in the fintech course, even before its maiden presentation, with more than 500 registrations already received,\u201d notes Ryan O\u2019Mahoney, chief marketing officer of GetSmarter, \u201cSeeing students sign up from across the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Hong Kong, Singapore, U.K., Australia and throughout Europe shows the breadth of the interest in this disruptive topic that is threatening long-established industries.\u201d\nThe course offers unparalleled access to thought leaders in fintech while the student undergoes theoretical knowledge development, as well as hands-on experience of innovation in areas such as collaboration tech and prediction markets.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve received registrations from industry leaders in banking, technology, investments and insurance, to name a few,\u201d Mahoney said. \u201cFrom startups looking to disrupt, to financial services professionals seeking an understanding of this disruption \u2013 whichever side of the fence you\u2019re on \u2013 \u00a0this course can offer great value.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 6}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nEthereum creator Vitalik Buterin was recently interviewed on Babbage, a podcast by The Economist. Buterin shared his long-term goals for Ethereum, which is a public blockchain that allows developers to easily deploy decentralized applications.\nA Programming Language for Blockchains\nWhen asked what inspired him to create Ethereum, Buterin first talked about how Bitcoin originally sparked his interest in blockchain technology. The open, permissionless nature of public blockchains is a key feature that attracted Buterin to the ecosystem. He noted, \u201cI like the idea of 12-year-olds potentially being able to build the next financial system and so forth. That\u2019s a large part of what attracted me [to] blockchain technology.\u201d\nWith Ethereum, Buterin intends to allow those programmers (young or old) to build much more than the financial applications of the future. The Ethereum blockchain is Turing complete, which differs from how things have worked in Bitcoin up to this point \u2012 Satoshi Nakamoto (Bitcoin\u2019s creator) purposely limited Bitcoin\u2019s scripting system for security reasons.\nButerin explained:\n\u201cI thought [those in the Bitcoin community] weren\u2019t approaching the problem in the right way. I thought they were going after individual applications; they were trying to kind of explicitly support each [use case] in a sort of Swiss Army knife protocol.\u201d\nWith a Turing complete programming language, the potential applications of the Ethereum blockchain are limited only by a developer\u2019s creativity. Buterin used an analogy to explain how this compares with Bitcoin:\n\u201cInstead of creating a device that just does a specific number of things, you have a device that understands and supports this programming language and whatever people want to do [can potentially be implemented].\"\nButerin mentioned shipment tracking and digital identity systems as two potential applications that could be built (or are being built) on top of Ethereum.\nIs Bitcoin the Napster of Cryptocurrencies?\nAlthough some claim Ethereum is not a direct competitor with Bitcoin and the two blockchain platforms could work well together, Babbage host Tom Standage asked Buterin if Bitcoin could be the Napster of cryptocurrencies (meaning that it would eventually be replaced by something better).\nButerin noted that a pure Bitcoin person (sometimes referred to as a Bitcoin maximalist) would say that other, centralized forms of digital currency from the past, such as David Chaum\u2019s ecash, would be a better fit for the Napster analogy. However, Buterin continued:\n\u201cIn practice, it\u2019s not nearly so simple because \u2012 I don\u2019t think Bitcoin is going to fail, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to disappear, but at the same time, it\u2019s very clearly not going to be the backbone for the entire world with absolutely everything decentralized running on top of it in some shape or form.\u201d\nSidechains, a concept created and mainly developed by Blockstream, is an attempt to bring increased functionality to the Bitcoin network and add greater utility to the Bitcoin token. One sidechain project, Rootstock, is a smart contracts platform quite similar to Ethereum. At this year\u2019s MIT Bitcoin Expo, RSK Labs cofounder and chief scientist Sergio Lerner claimed the project was partially put together by mashing together the Bitcoinj and Ethereumj clients.\nGoals for Ethereum Are Practical\nWhen asked about his long-term goals for Ethereum, the creator of this particular blockchain-based platform remained practical. In regard to whether Ethereum will become the one blockchain to rule them all, Buterin stated, \u201cThat could happen, but at the same time, we\u2019re completely prepared for more realistic scenarios.\u201d\nIn terms of developers creating a new blockchain for each use case of this new technology, Buterin said:\n\u201cThere might be some applications that might get their own ledger, [but] there\u2019s just so much different stuff that people are doing with blockchains \u2012 you\u2019re not going to create a specialized platform for each one.\u201d\nButerin added, \u201cThat\u2019s what people were doing in 2013, and they failed.\u201d\nButerin said he would still be happy if Ethereum was simply used for all of the long tail use cases of blockchains that don\u2019t have another specialized system to turn to.\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nCraig Steven Wright, who over the past days claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin, has been unable to publicly prove control over any of the keys that (only) Satoshi Nakamoto should possess. While his initial blog post\u00a0deceptively included a Satoshi Nakamoto\u00a0signature that was always publicly available, today he\u00a0announced he will not move any of \u201cSatoshi's bitcoins.\u201d\nYet four notable men in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency space still believe Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto, or leader of a team called \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto\u201d that also included the now-deceased Dave Kleiman. Bitcoin\u2019s former lead developer\u00a0Gavin Andresen and former\u00a0Bitcoin Foundation director\u00a0Jon Matonis met Wright over the past weeks, and \u2013 among other things \u2013 believe to have seen cryptographic proof. Digital currency veteran and\u00a0R3-architect\u00a0Ian Grigg has been publicly backing Wright's claim, too.\nThe fourth source maintaining that Wright is the man behind the alias Satoshi Nakamoto\u00a0is\u00a0New Liberty Dollar issuer\u00a0Joseph VaughnPerling. VaughnPerling says he met Wright at a conference in Amsterdam three years before publication of the Bitcoin white paper \u2013 and that Wright introduced himself as Satoshi Nakamoto at that time.\u00a0\nThis is not a new story: VaughnPerling has been saying he met Satoshi Nakamoto for years.\nMore recently, VaughnPerling appeared on the Bitcoin Core Slack channel, where he predicted Satoshi Nakamoto would reveal himself around this time.\nTo learn more, I reached out to VaughnPerling via the Bitcoin Core Slack channel myself. Late at night, at 2 a.m. local time, VaughnPerling responded. He seemed slightly pressed for time, and it had been a long day for me, so we only chatted for about 30 minutes.\nTo avoid too much interpretation from my end, I have decided to publish our full conversation.\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine\u00a0has not been able to find any other sources to confirm the information provided by VaughnPerling such as the message from the trustee of the Tulip Trust.\nJoseph VaughnPerling: You had some questions?\nAaron van Wirdum: The main question I have right now is: If Wright is Satoshi ... why would he publish fake proof? Any idea?\nJVP: I have some very good ideas. If I were in Dr. Wright's position, I would do exactly as he has done.\nI also have a message for Dr. Wright from the trustee of the Tulip trust that is controlling the coins that he wants to move. Not yet announced:\n\n\u201cThe Tulip Trading Trust trustee, appointed by Dave Kleiman as of Oct 12nd 2012. It has been rumored that Craig Wright will need to access Tulip Trading Trust assets. Trustee acts in the interest of the beneficiary alone and must defend against undue influence by others. In order to authorize movements of trust assets the beneficiary must come forward and make a direct request of the trustee our way \u2013 NOT via 3rd party nor any intermediaries. Any coin movement affecting the trust asset without prior authorization will be considered a trust violation and invalid irrespective of any claim of constructive bailment. The Trust alone has control over its assets. Tampering or manipulating with trust assets by anyone (including the beneficiary) might have material legal and tax implications. Beneficiaries are invited to a conference call 12:00 UTC Friday to discuss interests. Principals only.\u201d\n\nAVW: Can you help me out here? Who's who in this message? Is Wright a beneficiary?\nJVP: It is not my place to speculate on the transactions and assets of others.\nAVW: So you don't know?\nJVP: What I know and when I know it is not something I am interested in sharing. At least as\u00a0regards the matter\u00a0of the finances of others. It would show me to be a nosy one. And that much is already apparent to anyone looking at me. My nose is hard to miss.\nAVW: As I interpret that message, Dave Kleiman locked up Satoshi's holdings with Tulip Trust. In order to move Satoshi\u2019s coins, like Wright said he would, he needs access. Which he may or may not get ...\nJVP: Close, but it shows that you are not entirely familiar with how a trust works.\nAVW: That is correct.\nJVP: Did you have other questions?\nAVW: Why do you have this message?\nJVP: He will know why.\nAVW: Why are you sharing it with me?\nJVP: It will also be shared with some selected cryptographers.\nAVW: But I can publish it?\nJVP: Kind of you to ask. Yes.\nAVW: So you're really sharing it with the world then. Which brings us back to \"why\"...\nJVP: I would like for Craig Wright to have his privacy. He has already done more for us than we can repay, but it is not just this. I would like him to be able to do what he wants to do, without interference. We would all be better off when that occurs.\nAVW: How does sharing that message help?\nJVP: He is following a wrong path, because he must. He is doing it the least-wrong way possible. He is on Meifumando. It is as it has to be.\nAVW: What is the wrong path? And what is the right path?\nJVP: The world can learn much from what he has done and how. He is showing what cryptography does and does not do. It is a lesson that the world needs to learn before mass adoption can occur.\nAVW: Mass adoption of Bitcoin?\nJVP: The world was not ready for Bitcoin when it appeared. When the world learns these simple lessons, it will be more ready.\nAVW: Why is Bitcoin not ready for mass adoption?\nJVP: People do not understand what cryptography does and does not do. People do not understand pseudonymous. Having a key means you have a key. It does not mean you had it previously, or that you will have it in the future.\nAVW: Right ... So?\nJVP: He is forced on a stage, so he provides a masterful lesson that many who call themselves cryptographers seem to have forgotten.\nAVW: In what way is he forced?\nJVP: He said it himself, the decision to appear was made by others. Did you not even watch his video on BBC?\nAVW: Of course I did.\nJVP: Watch it again. You missed a lot.\nAVW: But he didn't say in what way he was forced, did he? Or how, or why ...\nJVP: I will say this much. If I were in his situation, I would have done as he did, though probably not even as well as he did.\nAVW: Wright's\u00a0Twitter account\u00a0bio says Ian Grigg and yourself maintain it. Is that true?\nJVP: Dr. Wright deleted his Twitter account for his own protection. A friend of his picked up the account as it came available to preserve it for him.\nAVW: So Ian and yourself are currently controlling that Twitter account?\nJVP: There may be others involved as well, but we are the ones that are taking the bullets.\nAVW: How well do you actually know Wright? You speak like you know him very well, but you just met him at a conference once, didn't you?\nJVP: I met him at a conference in 2005, he wore the moniker. We discussed what became Bitcoin at great length. He knew all there was to know about Bitcoin in 2005, and he shared it with me. I did not learn his government-registered name until much later.\nAVW: So you did get to know him later on?\nJVP: That's a story for another time.\nAVW: Did you know Dave Kleiman as well?\nJVP: Dave Kleiman was an exceptional man. If you want to know more about Dave, you should talk to the\u00a0SANS\u00a0folks.\nOne of the top SANS people is also having a conference in Las Vegas in September, where the Trustee of the Tulip Trust is expected to appear.\nAVW: Expected to appear?\nJVP: Very high probability.\nNot all details are decided, but I have heard that they may be even auctioning consultations with her.\nAVW: You realize all of this is a really weird story, right?\nJVP: Yes, and you have seen only the snowdrift on the tip of the iceberg. The level of weird is off the scale.\nAVW: Do you know the full story?\nJVP: I doubt even Craig knows the full story, but I could fill about 20 books.\nAVW: No offense, but: Why should I trust any of this? Why should I trust anything you say?\nJVP: Do your own research. Keep on your quest for knowledge. When you find someone who can teach you, listen carefully. When you find someone that can learn from you, be kind.\nAVW: You're skilled at avoiding questions through what sounds like ancient wisdoms.\nJVP: You are a reporter, the ancient wisdom is multiple sources, so ... do your own research \u2026\n\u00a0\nAuthor\u2019s note: The transcript was slightly edited for readability. Typos were fixed, punctuation improved\u00a0(VaughnPerling uses double-spaces),\u00a0the order of some questions was changed, and seemingly irrelevant text (like our chit-chat introductory talk) was removed.

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nFor the vast majority of Bitcoin Core contributors, the Lightning Network is viewed as the best option for scaling Bitcoin to many millions of new users. But the system has not yet been implemented on the Bitcoin blockchain, which has left many to wonder whether it is wise to put so much hope and reliance behind an untested solution.\nAt a recent event at the Coinbase offices in San Francisco, Lightning Network creators Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja gave a presentation on their design for scaling Bitcoin via a generalized network for payment channels. During their talk, Dryja and Poon responded to concerns from the audience about how the Lightning Network may eventually become somewhat centralized via so-called supernodes.\nSome Nodes Will Be Better-Connected Than Others\nCoinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam brought up the issue of supernodes during the Lightning Network presentation, and Poon responded to this concern, stating:\n\u201cI think there will be [some nodes] more-connected than others. It\u2019s important to make the nodes non-identifiable and easily interchangeable. When it comes to highly-connected nodes, it\u2019s not infinitely cheap. It\u2019s not going to be supernodes similar to BitTorrent or Skype peers (the way Skype worked five or ten years ago), simply because there are costs involved.\u201d\nThe main cost Poon was referring to here was \u201clocking up\u201d Bitcoin for the purposes of routing payments. On the consumer side, Dryja and Poon have noted that locking up money is a bit of a misnomer because users can still spend that money on the Lightning Network. Having said that, there is a time-value component for those who wish to make money via payment routing.\nAlthough many Bitcoin holders are hoping to make a return on their holdings via the Lightning Network, Dryja and Poon have also explained that the network may not be the gold rush that some were expecting. The duo believes fees on the network will be practically zero.\nPoon: There\u2019s No Advantage for Supernodes\nThe main reason Poon is not too worried about the potential existence of well-connected nodes is that there isn\u2019t much of a financial incentive to create those supernodes. He explained, \u201cIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s not possible. It\u2019s just, what do you get out of it?\u201d\nPoon expounded on this point:\n\u201cIf you have infinite money and want to connect to everyone, then yeah, that can happen, but there\u2019s no real advantage for you, as a node, to do that. That\u2019s why I\u2019m actually not that concerned about a node topology that\u2019s centralizing \u2012 because there\u2019s no network effect that benefits you. Because they\u2019re relatively interchangeable, so if you start extracting a fair amount of rent on it, they\u2019ll just go with someone else.\u201d\nPoon did mention that well-connected nodes on the network will likely be used for smaller micropayments. This is due to the lower upfront capital costs associated with routing payments valued at around a penny to those that are for something like a cup of coffee.\nDryja added that there may be advantages for direct payment channels between two counterparties, but there won\u2019t be much difference between payments that use two versus three or four hops.\nFurther Analysis from BitGo\u2019s Jameson Lopp\nOne individual who has been thinking and writing about the technical challenges of the Lightning Network quite a bit lately is BitGo engineer and Statoshi.info creator Jameson Lopp.\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine\u00a0reached out to Lopp for his perspective on Poon\u2019s comments. In regard to the incentives (or lack thereof) to run a supernode, Lopp stated:\n\u201cIf you assume that routing fees are positive (because they can be negative in certain situations) then there is an incentive to run a highly connected routing node in order to extract more fees. On the other hand, there is a disincentive to run a popular routing node because it requires keeping the private keys \u2018exposed\u2019 on a running machine that is connected to the Internet, which is fairly risky.\u201d\nLopp added, \u201cIt remains to be seen where the equilibrium will settle between these opposing dynamics.\u201d\nLopp also noted that fears related to the Lightning Network need to be based on more than just centralization, as it\u2019s more about the risks associated with a particular type of centralization that could be problematic. He noted, \u201cThe problem with any centralization argument is that you first need to explain the potential outcomes you're fearing.\u201d\nLopp went on to explain that the possibly centralized aspect of the Lightning Network that worries him is the topological centralization of the node network because it would make the network more fragile and prone to collapse under stressful situations.\nLopp explained that a few entities routing the majority of the payments on the network may not be as much of an issue if those entities are running many nodes. However, he continued:\n\u201cThere would still be a concern that those few entities could choose to turn off all of their nodes, wreaking havoc until such time as Lightning Network users could re-establish new channels and \u2018heal\u2019 the network via on-chain transactions.\u201d\nLopp also noted possible censorship and privacy issues related to centralization among a small number of entities:\n\u201cCentralization among a small number of entities would also pose privacy and censorship issues, making it harder to route around uncooperative entities or those known to collect data for the purposes of deanonymization.\u201d\nBlockstream\u2019s Rusty Russell, who is working on his own implementation of the Lightning Network, has noted his belief that the layer-2 protocol will likely feature a Tor-esque arms race between those who wish to preserve privacy and those who wish to abolish it. Russell and other Lightning Network developers are also working on Tor-style onion routing for the network.\nLopp told Bitcoin Magazine that many of the fears about the Lightning Network can only manifest in conjunction with mempool backlogs, which would make it difficult to re-establish a channel on the Lightning Network.\nCoinbase Is Concerned About Centralization Risks\nRepresentatives from Coinbase were rather concerned with the potential centralization risks associated with the Lightning Network during Dryja and Poon\u2019s presentation. The Lightning Network creators were highly appreciative of this acknowledgement of the importance of decentralization from the Bitcoin exchange.\nAt least one Coinbase representative mentioned that the company is not necessarily looking to make money off the Lightning Network.

The paper highlights \u201creal business cases\u201d for the technology, arguing that financial services need to be reformed and not simply improved.\nThere has been some misunderstanding at the root of the debate around digital currencies and finance: the idea that digital currencies are based on a new \u201ctechnology\u201d that can be applied to financial markets as they are.\nMassimo Morini, who penned the paper, \u201cFrom \u2018Blockchain hype\u2019 to a real business case for Financial Markets\u201d recently spoke to Bitcoin Magazine and said that things are different.\n\u201cDigital currencies have displayed a radically new business model for transactions, where the use of cryptography and a single distributed ledger makes many passages in the process less reliant on trust in the counterparty,\u201d he said. \u201cThe same is true for the logic of smart or automated contracts that many people in finance are investigating.\u201d\nIt is only by making the business process less reliant on trust that banks can fruitfully exploit the lessons surrounding digital currencies. In the debate around digital currencies and finance, the concept of trust is typically used in a black-and-white sense: a totally trustless model vs. a model based on absolute trust. However, Morini adds that this is another mistake to avoid.\n\u201cThis is not real. Different business models involve different levels of trust other than zero or full trust,\u201d he said. \u201cThe financial industry does not need to remove trust as much as Bitcoin, since the financial players are identifiable off-chain and are usually already committed in the market, within a precise legal framework.\u201d\nThey could, Morini added, benefit from removing trust from many passages of their business model, which is still based on the \u201cconsensus-by-reconciliation\u201d approach.\nIn the \u201cconsensus-by-reconciliation\u201d business model, many aspects of a deal, especially in the derivatives market, are left to the individual interpretation of a paper contract with every player giving a private representation in its private ledger with no shared source of authority. As a consequence, uncertainty dominates and litigations are possible, which can lead to legal troubles and unexpected losses. This increases risk and capital requirements with a bottleneck effect as it requires frequent reconciliation steps.\nMorini says, though, that there is a way that blockchains can solve these problems within the financial industry.\n\u201cAn initial validation through a consensus algorithm, a single authoritative representation on a distributed ledger and the enforcement of atomic consensus through smart contracts would do away with many of the problems, making the market more transparent, safe and efficient,\u201d he said.\nBut introducing a single distributed ledger or a smart contract into the financial industry is not an easy transformation not simply because of the technical issues like scalability and privacy; the evolution of the market has to be taken into account, too. For example, Morini explains that changing contracts, accounting standards and regulations need to follow the market evolution. He is optimistic, though, that changes will eventually take place.\n\u201cWe talk of changes allowing more transparency and safety, so I expect they will come, but it may take a while for the market players to understand and implement them,\u201d he said. \u201cThis regards regulators, bodies that define market standards and the banks themselves.\u201d\nIntroducing bilateral smart contract consensus on a distributed ledger within the financial industry would have a significant impact; however, non-collateralized derivatives would not benefit so much from consensus on a bilateral portfolio, as the risk of double spending and default would still be high, says Morini.\n\u201cUnder an up-to-standard collateral agreement the resources to run a deal can become part of the deal itself,\u201d he said. \u201cMore certainty and determinism via a shared ledger, with smart contracts managing a deal-common valuation can cut risks and costs to a fraction compared to the current standard.\u201d\nIn order for banks to reform themselves to implement the blockchain technology, Morini says that they need to change their ways.\n\u201cBanks need to be ready to move from traditional privacy on their valuation and reporting approaches to a new system where at least the parties of a deal accept to share some of the accounting and to automate, at least in part, the enforcement of consensus.\u201d\nSince its introduction, blockchain technology has been growing at an exponential rate and is predicted to continue improving on its technology in the future. Recently, Morini co-organized the\u00a0QuanTech Conference where he saw two demonstrations of blockchain services targeted toward financial contracts. One demo was based on\u00a0R3\u2019s Corda distributed ledger platform incorporating smart contract templates. The second was based on the Decentralized Clearing Network by Robert Sams\u2019\u00a0Clearmatics, including valuation provided by open source financial software company OpenGamma.\n\u201cBoth were just demos,\u201d said Morini. \u201cBut they were inconceivable a few months ago.\u201d\nDespite the fact that fully replicated distributed databases can be found dating back to the early \u201890s, banks have yet to introduce a distributed ledger. In fact that transforming a fully replicated and distributed database into an automatized marketplace and as an authoritative ledger was not a trivial conceptual step. Bitcoin was created in a free anonymous market, and the \u201csuccess of this was the necessary stimulus to understand the effectiveness of a single ledger, an automated business logic, and a clever use of cryptography,\u201d said Morini.\n\u201cConsider that digital currencies created the right environment for the development of many services that did not exist before digital currencies, that can now be very useful in finance. A good example is what\u00a0Oraclize did in Ethereum,\u201d said Morini.", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 10}

The signups for the alpha release are open. The project is the brainchild of Mihai Alisie, cofounder of Bitcoin Magazine.\nThe Akasha, a Sanskrit word, is the unseen medium that pervades the universe and, in Eastern religions and spiritual traditions, serves as a substrate for the \u201cAkashic Records\u201d \u2012 a permanent repository embedded in the fabric of space-time for all the information that is ever produced in the universe. Alisie\u2019s project doesn\u2019t go that far yet: it just wants to establish a permanent repository embedded in the fabric of the Internet for all the information that is ever produced online.\n\u201cEver since I joined Vitalik [Buterin] in the Ethereum project as cofounder in late 2013, I\u2019ve dreamed about the ways Ethereum could be used to solve some of the biggest issues we face as a civilization,\u201d says Alisie. \u201cHowever, it wasn\u2019t until early 2015 when I first realized that we are about to create the missing puzzle piece that will enable us to tackle two of the most important challenges we face today as a modern information-based society: freedom of expression and creative perpetuity.\u201d\nThe problem that the Akasha project wants to solve is the impermanence of information online. Information \u2012 web sites, documents, email archives, video, etc. \u2012 can be either purposefully deleted by the governments and/or corporations that control today\u2019s Internet, or, more simply but equally tragic, just disappear for lack of maintenance of the central servers where it\u2019s hosted.\nIn fact, today\u2019s Internet is becoming centralized, with billions of users dependent on a handful of large services. Today\u2019s Internet is also fragile, because it relies on a centralized distribution model, with servers that come and go. If a server goes down for any technical or commercial reason, or is taken down by the authorities, all the web pages stored on that server disappear.\n\u201cThe next time you stumble upon a 404 page remember that it is a small tragedy in itself. It is almost as if our collective brain has lost a piece of its memory, sometimes forever,\u201d says Alisie. \u201cWe are basically living in an information age plagued by arbitrary censorship and digital amnesia, affecting every Internet user.\u201d\nThe Internet Archive, with its Wayback Machine that stores snapshots of web pages and entire sites, can permit recovering lost information if a suitable snapshot is available, but sometimes it doesn\u2019t have the time to make a backup copy if the original is deleted soon after creation, which can happen in case of rapid government intervention.\nIt would be good to have a backup system built into the fabric of the Internet, but for that to happen the Internet must evolve toward a decentralized, distributed infrastructure independent of central servers. A limited but conceptually sound model for a decentralized Internet is provided by the BitTorrent network, where files are not stored centrally but locally on the computers of the network\u2019s users. In Alisie\u2019s words:\n\u201cWhat would happen if there was no server to delete information from and instead the content would live forever on a decentralized network serving data through a fractal of nodes? We\u2019re about to find out.\u201d\nAfter a lot of study and prototyping work, the Akasha team has found a suitable technology stack to implement a decentralized, distributed Internet. The cornerstones of the Akasha stack are Ethereum and the InterPlanetary File System, augmented by Electron, React with Redux, and Node.js.\nThe InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that connects all participating nodes with the same file system and permits building versioned file systems, blockchains, all the way to a permanent distributed Web. IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other. Recently, OpenBazaar, a blockchain-based decentralized marketplace, started integrating the IPFS into its platform.\nIn an article titled \u201cLocking the Web Open, a Call for a Distributed Web,\u201d Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle, an early Internet entrepreneur also known for founding other pioneering initiatives such as the Internet Credit Union, Alexa and the early supercomputer company Thinking Machines, challenged funders, visionaries, coders and activists to build the decentralized Internet with technologies similar to those used by the Akasha project.\nSince Akasha is built on Ethereum, it will have a built-in infrastructure suitable for micropayments. \u201cIn the first phase ETH will be the native token used inside the Akasha ecosystem,\u201d notes the Akasha website. \u201cWe chose to focus first on building a working decentralized application and learning from the actual use what sorts of problems we should be solving with a custom token.\u201d\nPerhaps Akasha could advance toward implementing the native Internet payment system and other advanced features foreseen in Ted Nelson\u2019s Project Xanadu, a conceptual precursor of today\u2019s World Wide Web, which were never implemented due to lack of enabling technologies. \u201cHumanity needs a better home of Mind,\u201d concludes Alisie referring to John Perry Barlow\u2019s \u201cA Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace.\u201d\u00a0\nEditor's note: Mihai Alisie was one of the original founders of\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine, along with Vitalik Buterin.", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 6}

In a speech given at an event organized by Digital Catapult and Imperial College\u2019s Centre for Cryptocurrency Research and Engineering (IC3RE), Hancock outlined some of the government\u2019s current plans to leverage blockchain technology for government applications.\nThe \u201cpolicy hack day\u201d for government representatives was organized by Digital Catapult and the IC3RE on April 26 in order to help government officials identify possible applications of blockchain technology in public service delivery. According to an Imperial College press release, Hancock \u201creinforced the importance of digital technologies not just for digitizing existing processes but also for transforming the manner in which government services are delivered for the benefit of citizens.\u201d\n\u201cBlockchains \u2012 distributed ledgers, shared ledgers \u2012 are digital tools for building trust in data,\u201d explained Hancock. \u201cRather than a single central authority demanding trust and declaring: \u2018I say this data is correct,\u2019 you have the distributed consensus of everyone in the chain, saying in unison: \u2018we agree that this data is correct.\u2019\u201d\nHancock added that data held in the blockchain comes with its own history, and that history is a fundamental part of proving its integrity. \u201cThis fact is enormously powerful,\u201d he said. While cautioning against considering the emerging blockchain technology as a generally applicable solution for all problems, Hancock emphasized that the technology offers efficient solutions for important use cases.\nTo place distributed ledger technology in a historical context, Hancock invited the audience to consider parallels with older technologies \u2012 typewriters and carbon copies. In fact, carbon copies revolutionized government work by providing more physical security and more protection against tampering, since multiple copies of a document could be held in different places. \u201cThe carbon copy gave you simple, instant, distributed, consensual data,\u201d said Hancock.\nHancock recalled that Bitcoin \u2012 the first operational application of distributed ledger technology \u2012 proved that distributed ledgers can be used to track currency as it is passed from one entity to another. But the establishment of distributed consensus, permitted by blockchain technology, could have countless applications beyond payments. The U.K. government is committed to exploring nonpayment applications of distributed ledgers, with the goal of streamlining public service work.\n\u201cWe\u2019re exploring the use of a blockchain to manage the distribution of grants,\u201d said Hancock. \u201cMonitoring and controlling the use of grants is incredibly complex. A blockchain, accessible to all the parties involved, might be a better way of solving that problem.\u201d\nSimilar applications could permit making all sorts of government expenditures more efficient and transparent, from student loans to humanitarian aid. \u201cThink about the Student Loans Company tracking money all the way from Treasury to a student\u2019s bank account,\u201d said Hancock. \u201cOr the Department for International Development tracking money all the way to the aid organization spending the money in country.\u201d\nThe Guardian notes that the U.K. has had difficulties with government information systems. Record-keeping problems have emerged in the passport agency, the tax credit system and the National Health Service, which was forced in 2011 to announce the abandonment of a multibillion pound scheme to computerize every patient record. These are the kinds of problems for which the government is beginning to envisage blockchain-based solutions.\nAlso at the policy hack day, the U.K. government\u2019s Chief Technology Officer Liam Maxwell summarized other possible government applications for distributed ledger technologies, from identity management to automating contracts in local authorities, tracking provenance in food supply chains and even a blockchain-based Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).\nHancock\u2019s considerations are but the last of many endorsements of blockchain technology by high-profile representatives of the U.K. government. In January, Bitcoin Magazine reported that a new report produced by the U.K. Government Office for Science, edited by Sir Mark Walport, chief scientific adviser, explored how distributed ledger technology can revolutionize service and recommended specific government actions.\nIn 2015, the U.K. government launched a new research initiative to bring together the Research Councils, Alan Turing Institute and Digital Catapult with industry in order to address the research opportunities and challenges for digital currency technology, and increased research funding in this area.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 4}

Jack Markell. \u201cWe think the benefits could really be tremendous.\u201d Markell\u2019s office has already begun working with the state\u2019s powerful bar association to determine how best to incorporate the technology into state law and will start a pilot program to move state archival records onto an open distributed ledger.\nSymbiont, a smart securities company created in 2015 to interface traditional financial markets and cryptographic blockchain technology, is participating in the Delaware blockchain initiative. After securing $1.25 million of seed funding from influential financial market leaders including Duncan Niederauer, former CEO of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), soon after launch, Symbiont closed a $7 million funding round in January, valuing the company at $70 million.\nThe blockchain system will be faster and cheaper than the existing process since it automates a number of processes, including share registry, capital-table management and shareholder communications, said Symbiont CEO Mark Smith. The system likely will benefit private companies that incorporate in the state by making it easier to keep track of all the equity issued and the different shareholder rights after multiple financing rounds.\nMore than 1 million companies are incorporated in Delaware, including half of all publicly traded companies in the U.S. and 65 percent of the Fortune 500. Incorporation services have been an important part of Delaware\u2019s economy, but the state seems to be losing its competitive advantages to other business-friendly jurisdictions in the U.S. and abroad, which are making efforts to attract new businesses. Delaware must now make special efforts to keep companies in the state and attract new ones, and a simplified and more efficient record-keeping system could certainly help.\n\"Delaware has long been the jurisdiction of choice for the most innovative companies in the world,\" Markell said in a press release. \"The Delaware Blockchain Initiative demonstrates the state's commitment to ensuring this remains the case for the growing blockchain technology sector. By creating the opportunity for a broad range of corporations \u2012 from Fortune 500 companies to startups \u2012 to take advantage of distributed ledger and smart contract applications, we are laying the groundwork for a more modern, secure and transparent business environment for years to come.\"\nThe governor\u2019s office press release confirms that the state is working closely with Symbiont to develop the technical aspects of the Delaware Blockchain Initiative. Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, the leading blockchain technology legal team, is developing the legal infrastructure.\n\"It is our mission at Symbiont to work with market-leading institutions, and we are delighted to work with the State of Delaware,\" said Smith. \"Given its leadership position in incorporation services, it's an ideal proving ground for smart contracts.\"\nOn May 2, Markell unveiled the details of the Delaware Blockchain Initiative at the opening keynote presentation at the Consensus 2016 conference in New York City.\nAt Consensus 2016, after recalling Delaware\u2019s track record in deploying new technology in a timely manner in state administration, including electronic corporate record transmissions, electronic director votes and virtual stockholder meetings, Markell explained how the state would be proceeding in technological and regulatory direction with blockchain, International Business Times reports.\u00a0\nThe governor emphasized that the initiative is expected to help the private companies that need to keep track of shareholder rights after multiple rounds of financing, each with different terms and conditions.\n\"We see companies allocate significant financial resources to correct and validate stock authorization and issuance errors that could have been correctly and seamlessly handled from the outset,\" said Markell. \u201c\"Distributed ledger shares hold the promise of immediate clearance, immediate settlement and bring with them dramatic increases in efficiency and speed in the sophisticated commercial transactions for which Delaware is known.\u201d\u00a0\n\"I think we are a good fit for Delaware because we have a very flexible and extensible system,\u201d added Symbiont\u2019s Smith. \u201cSo our platform is really designed around smart contracts and being neutral to the underlying ledger layer. It's not about the ledger layer for us, it's about the intelligence of the smart contracts.\"\u00a0\nSmith mentioned a new initiative called Smart Loans, soon to be incorporated in Delaware.\nPhoto\u00a0Jeffrey\u00a0/ Flickr(CC)", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 9}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nJudging from various reports in the media over the past year, Bitcoin is in a serious crisis that threatens its very existence. Longtime Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn even left the ecosystem entirely and claimed the project is now a failed experiment. Of course, Bitcoin has been proclaimed dead roughly 100 other times.\nScalability is the main concern in Bitcoin right now, but some, including Blockchain Capital Managing Director Brock Pierce, have argued that this is more a sign of success than anything else. The fact that the system needs to scale in order to welcome new users is a sign that people find this technology useful for a variety of use cases.\nWhile it\u2019s important to not become complacent (as longtime cypherpunk Zooko Wilcox-O\u2019Hearn recently warned). Blockstream\u2019s Johnny Dilley said recently that much of the distress and panic coming from certain segments of the community is unwarranted. During an interview on The Crypto Show, Dilley said that progress on scalability is being made by the Bitcoin Core developers, and development gridlock is not as big an issue as some would think.\nWhat Is the Worst That Could Happen?\nOne of the main reasons there is a belief that Bitcoin is reaching a crisis point has to do with blocks filling up to near capacity (at times). As blocks fill with transactions, a bidding war ensues for the right to get one\u2019s transaction into a block (and confirmed) in a timely manner. In response to this potential issue, Dilley told The Crypto Show:\n\n\u201cThe absolute worst thing that could happen to Bitcoin right now is the classic analog: Nobody goes to that restaurant anymore; it\u2019s always full.\u201d\n\nThis point reiterates Pierce\u2019s recent statement on how Bitcoin\u2019s scalability issue is a sign of its success. In his remark, Dilley was echoing comments made by BitTorrent creator Bram Cohen in June 2015.\nTo get a second opinion on Bitcoin\u2019s possible crisis point, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Digital Currency Council Director of Curriculum & Content Dan McArdle, who believes on-chain transactions should be kept as cheap as possible for as long as possible (via an increase to Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit and other means).\nIn regard to Dilley\u2019s (or more rightly Cohen\u2019s) restaurant analogy, McArdle responded, \u201cWell, that one restaurant may be crowded, but by not expanding quickly when there's ample demand, it's inviting competitors to eat its lunch.\u201d\nMcArdle added that Bitcoin has had no competition in the blockchain-based electronic cash market up to this point, but he fears the door to more competition is opened as Bitcoin is \u201chot-wired for settlement,\u201d as Bitcoin Classic developers Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik have referred to it, via Bitcoin Core\u2019s development roadmap for capacity increases.\nScaling Progress Continues to Be Made\nWhile figuring out how to allow more people to use Bitcoin is indeed an issue, Dilley said that work is being done to help solve this problem.\n\u201cTo be clear, the slow, mediated, not-compromised and technically sound progress continues to be made,\u201d he said. \u201cThe things that are in Bitcoin\u2019s best interest continue to get done.\u201d\nThe recently released Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 is perhaps the strongest evidence to back up Dilley\u2019s claim. This release includes a soft fork for CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY, which allows for relative locktimes and is hugely important for the development of the Lightning Network, which Blockstream CTO and Bitcoin Core contributor Greg Maxwell views as Bitcoin\u2019s best chance at handling increasing demand for Bitcoin transactions. Bloq co-founder Jeff Garzik disagrees and views sidechains as a better option.\nBitcoin Core 0.12.1 was also the first time the group of contributors behind the project used BIP 9 (Version Bits) to deploy a soft fork. This method of deployment allows multiple soft forks to be rolled out simultaneously, which means improvements can be implemented more quickly.\nIs Bitcoin Threatened by Political Gridlock?\nSome members of the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as Bitcoin Foundation chief scientist Gavin Andresen, worry that the difficulties associated with making changes to Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules are slowing down the development process, but others, such as Bitcoin Core contributor Cory Fields (who is Andresen\u2019s colleague at the MIT Digital Currency Initiative), feel that the inability to implement controversial changes is a sign of strength in terms of Bitcoin\u2019s level of decentralization.\nDuring his interview on The Crypto Show, Dilley compared gridlock in Bitcoin development to gridlock in Congress:\n\n\u201cThe differences between political gridlock in Congress and political gridlock in Bitcoin are: One, one doesn\u2019t tax your ****, and two: Bitcoin keeps working.\u201d\n\nDilley\u2019s point was that Bitcoin would keep working in a scenario where complete gridlock happened and no further changes were possible.\n\u201cIf every person who could develop on Bitcoin died today (and we assume that there are no security flaws that are going to arise tomorrow that need rapid action) \u2012 it will keep working,\u201d he said.\nBitcoin Magazine also asked McArdle for his thoughts on political gridlock in Bitcoin. McArdle referred to this as a \u201cfascinating concept\u201d and admitted that he\u2019s divided on this one. He explained:\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, I think gridlock is good if initial conditions are set well (which is, of course, subjective). The U.S. federal government, by design, experiences gridlock in order to ensure that only very important changes occur (theoretically). On the other hand, Bitcoin is a technology that doesn't exist in a vacuum or within some physical border. There has to be a good balance between being nimble and being incorruptible. The ecosystem is only beginning to define its best practices.\u201d\n\nAvoiding a Startup-esque Development Process\nOne last point made by Dilley on The Crypto Show was that Bitcoin does not use the sort of fast-paced development process that is often found at startups in Silicon Valley. Dilley noted why, in his view, this approach has not been taken by Bitcoin Core contributors:\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about $6.5 billion of value, we\u2019re talking about the first attempt for a truly sovereign money. To take an approach where it\u2019s just go as fast as you can until it breaks is not really something that you want to be in place when it comes to Bitcoin.\u201d\nDilley also noted that the fast-paced approach may work when developing a new photo-sharing app, but things work differently when you\u2019re talking about people\u2019s money. He added, \u201cIf Bitcoin goes dark for six hours, the game is over, and cryptocurrency gets set back 10 years.\u201d\nA Crossroads Rather Than a Crisis\nAlthough some say Bitcoin currently is in a crisis, McArdle defines the current situation as a crossroads. He told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n\u201cThere are competing visions for how to upgrade the system and they have different long-term tradeoffs. But on a technical level, either will work, and one (or both) will soon be implemented, so I don't think it's fair to say that this is a full-blown \u2018crisis.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn terms of his preference for Bitcoin\u2019s future direction, McArdle added:\n\u201cThrowing in the towel on main-chain scaling now, in favor of a \u2018settlement-layer\u2019 approach due to the realization that blocksize can't scale forever is a little bit like throwing the baby out with the bathwater.\u201d\nMcArdle believes Bitcoin should scale via on-chain and layer-2 solutions.\n\u201cIt doesn't have to be one or the other,\u201d he said, \u201cand main-chain fees don't have to rise soon, even with significantly increasing usage.\u201d\nAs far as the declarations that the Bitcoin experiment is over, McArdle finds such claims to be vastly premature and more-or-less absurd. Although he\u2019s concerned that many in the Bitcoin ecosystem are willing to accept higher on-chain fees, ignore the competitive landscape and opt for more complex solutions (at least in his view), he added, \u201cNone of that means Bitcoin is failing by any means.\u201d\nMcArdle shared these final thoughts on Bitcoin\u2019s crossroads moment:\n\n\u201cWhen I first started researching Bitcoin in 2011, I realized that it had the potential to be the best form of money humanity has ever created. And that's still true today. After all, money in all forms, be it seashells or government-issued digits in a bank account, is just a societal ledger used to reduce the friction of exchange. Bitcoin is the most irrefutable, global, low-friction ledger ever created. We should make sure that however Bitcoin grows, all of those properties remain intact.\u201d\n", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 11}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nA panel at a recent cryptocurrency event hosted by the Cato Institute discussed the differences between public blockchains (such as Bitcoin) and the distributed ledger technology currently being researched by various Wall Street firms and consortiums. Although many people view consortium blockchains as competition for Bitcoin, the reality is that these systems are mostly intended for different use cases.\nWhile Wall Street\u2019s distributed ledger technology may offer substantial improvements over their current systems, these permissioned ledgers may not be able to provide the level of openness and regulatory arbitrage offered by Bitcoin.\nBitcoin Enables an Open-Access Approach\nLedgerX CEO Paul L. Chou was one of the participants on the recent Cato panel, and noted that the openness of the Bitcoin blockchain was the first thing that attracted him to this new technology. Chou recalled his excitement when first learning about Bitcoin:\n\u201cI think, for me, the most exciting thing was really this idea of an open-access ledger that anybody could use and anybody could, importantly, program on. So if you\u2019re a 12-year-old kid with no relationships to Wall Street ... before, it was impossible to get access to any of the ledgers that banks use right now. Now, for the first time, if you\u2019re a talented 12-year-old programmer, you can build an application that \u2012 whether you like Bitcoin as a currency or not \u2012 it is moving some sort of value around in an automated way.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll find the next Mark Zuckerberg of finance potentially with this open-access approach,\u201d Chou said. \u201cYou want the people who can just tinker on the side and not have to go through a lot of these meetings and things to get access to all these systems that banks currently use.\u201d\nOther payment platforms, such as PayPal and Ripple, also allow developers to build applications on top of their systems without much restriction; however, permission from the traditional financial system usually comes into play when it comes to unleashing that new financial application in the wild. The process is much more open with Ripple when compared to PayPal, but the early days of payments on that network essentially require large hubs to allow unconnected users to transact with one another; it still isn\u2019t a completely open system in that sense.\nIn addition to the perks of an open-access ledger, Chou also noted, \u201cI see a lot of very exciting potential applications for Bitcoin in microfinance.\u201d\nHe further explained:\n\n\u201cI worked on Wall Street at Goldman Sachs, and the business model there is very high-touch, very large clients with a lot of depth who need a lot of coverage. That\u2019s fine for one model, but there\u2019s also, I think, room for a model where it\u2019s very low-touch, where the amounts that we\u2019re talking about that people want to save or invest are not that significant to justify a Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley kind of going into that market.\u201d\n\nWall Street\u2019s Blockchains May Be Held Back by Regulation\nR3CEV General Counsel Jacob Farber, who was also featured on the panel, shared the current perspective of financial institutions that are experimenting with distributed ledger technology. Although Farber noted financial institutions are not religious about their focus on nonpublic blockchains, he also pointed out the main reasoning behind their current point of view:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this not very specific but probably reasonably correct sense that, from a regulatory perspective, knowing who the entities are that are running a network is important if you\u2019re a regulated financial institution using the network.\u201d\n\nFarber added that it makes sense for banks to look at permissioned ledgers when the systems they\u2019re attempting to upgrade are already based on a permissioned model. He also claimed permissioned ledgers may be preferred over open systems for some specific financial applications for technical reasons.\nIn terms of whether Wall Street may eventually switch to a public blockchain, such as Bitcoin, Farber noted, \u201c[If] we\u2019re presented with a solution that solves all of our problems, is regulatorily acceptable, is better, and it is an open system, I don\u2019t know [whether] that wouldn\u2019t be just as appealing.\u201d\nPermissioned Ledgers Are Not Unbreakable Chains\nWith the conversation moving back to Chou, the LedgerX CEO stated that there\u2019s definitely room in the market for permissioned ledgers.\n\u201cCertainly, our clients\u2019 account balances and the fees we charge them are not on some public ledger that anybody can view at any time,\u201d Chou said. \u201cI think the real elephant in the room when we talk about this debate is whether elements of the Bitcoin proposal make sense in a permissioned environment.\u201d\nChou noted that mining is a crucial aspect of the original Bitcoin proposal. He indicated that a lack of mining in a supposed blockchain proposal changes the implications of the distributed ledger technology one is building:\n\n\u201cI know a lot of people are taking the approach where they channel transactions and their blocks together, but there\u2019s no mining at all. But they still think it\u2019s some sort of unbreakable chain when, in fact, that\u2019s not the case.\u201d\n\nThis gets back to Farber\u2019s point about regulation. To many, Bitcoin\u2019s core value proposition is censorship resistance, and it appears that (for now) forms of bank-powered distributed ledger technology will not threaten this use case. In this regard, the centralization of mining power may be a more serious, existential threat to Bitcoin\u2019s usefulness.", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 12}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nAs Bitcoin blocks get closer to full capacity, some members of the community are claiming many of the transactions on the network are nothing more than spam.\u00a0\nDefining a spam transaction on the Bitcoin network is somewhat difficult. In fact, Mastering Bitcoin author Andreas Antonopoulos believes it\u2019s impossible for such transactions to exist.\nAccording to Antonopoulos, the fact that someone is willing to pay the fee associated with a particular transaction means that the transaction is not spam by default. During a meetup at Paralelni Polis in Prague, Czech Republic, Antonopoulos explained his position on spam transactions on the Bitcoin network.\nA Top-Down Approach to Spam\nAntonopoulos noted there are two approaches that can be taken:\n\n\u201cOne is a paternalistic, top-down approach that says, \u2018This is what is allowed. This is what is not allowed, and by making a list, we will prevent the network from filling to capacity.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn Antonopoulos\u2019 view, this sort of approach would break net neutrality, which he believes applies to Bitcoin; but the reality is that Bitcoin does not work on net neutrality as a requirement. For example, the Eligius mining pool applies a penalty or simply will not mine some transactions it considers to be spam.\nAntonopoulos also explained how picking out spam with a top-down approach would cause Bitcoin to miss out on potential new applications of the blockchain. He noted:\n\n\u201cIf we start making decisions about what is spam and what is not, we are now choosing the future of Bitcoin and constraining it according to a set of applications that only we can imagine. And the brilliant person who creates the application we can\u2019t imagine \u2012 that maybe looked like spam to us \u2012 doesn\u2019t get carried across the network because we made the top-down decision to say that transaction is illegitimate.\u201d\n\nIf You Pay the Fee, the Transaction Is Not Spam\nAntonopoulos said that any transaction a user attaches a fee to is legitimate by definition. He added, \u201cThe very act of paying the fee legitimizes the transaction.\u201d\nAntonopoulos also explained how the market for block space allows miners to prioritize some transactions over others. He stated:\n\n\u201cUse the market to solve this problem, and allow the market to establish the minimum fee that meets the requirements of supply through the miners and their need for propagating blocks fast, and the demand of the users for the applications they care about. And if you pay the fee, your transaction is legitimate.\u201d\n\nAntonopoulos went as far as to say the existence of this market means there is no such thing as a spam transaction in Bitcoin. He explained:\n\n\u201cThere is no spam transaction. There is no such thing as an illegitimate transaction. There are only transactions that did get mined and transactions that didn\u2019t have enough fee to get mined.\u201d\n\nSometimes Bitcoin Is Not Needed\nPeople want to use the Bitcoin blockchain for many different use cases, but the people who are going to have mostly unconditional access to the blockchain are going to be the ones paying the highest fees. The need for censorship resistance in one\u2019s online transactions is the main use case of the Bitcoin blockchain that is not found anywhere else (outside of altcoins).\nAs fees rise, the users who don\u2019t necessarily have to use the Bitcoin blockchain will find alternatives. These alternatives could be off-chain iterations of the current Bitcoin network. Those who require the use of a public blockchain will pay the higher fees.", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 12}

While the team admits \u201climitations\u201d in the project\u2019s current state \u2012 for instance, a store must run the OB client in order to appear online \u2012 buyers and sellers are now free to come together and buy and sell goods for various forms of payment, including bitcoins.\u00a0\nUnlike Silk Road and similar darknet-located platforms, OB promises no anonymity and warns users upon signup that their IP addresses are public.\u00a0\nThe platform, largely inspired by modern social media, is likely to evolve like other social media sites, where people interact with you \u2012 by, for instance, following you \u2012 so that you become aware of their store.\u00a0\nThe stores of OB are diverse. For instance, Dragibus sells a quarterly print publication on the botany, cultivation, history and usage of medicinal and entheogenic plants.\u00a0\nPhysical products abound on OB, as well.\nSurf and Skim City, which has had a brick and mortar store in Florida since 2006, is one of the best developed stores on the application. The store is selling on OB because it believes there is a \u201cbig need for decentralization\u201d in ecommerce. At their storefront, they offer a 2 percent discount on Bitcoin purchases, the sort of rebate Bitcoin merchants will need to offer if they want to increase demand for the digital currency. The shop is run by a group of professional skimboarders/surfers in Florida who have been Bitcoiners for many years.\u00a0\nAccording to Mark Cole, founder of Surf and Skim City, \u201cOB is the first thing to show what Bitcoin is capable of.\u201d \u00a0He laments some of OB\u2019s glitches, but his tech team has been working with a \u201chelpful\u201d OB support team on the bugs. Cole says the website almost immediately received an order for a custom-made Apex 10-3 skimboard. The team wants to run it 24/7, but instead runs the OB store whenever they can.\u00a0\n\u201cI think the developers will find a way to get that achieved,\u201d Cole said.\nFounder and programmer Brian Hoffman told Bitcoin Magazine the platform has been downloaded 100,000 times, and believes it\u2019s mostly Bitcoiners.\u00a0\n\u201cLooking at what is available on the marketplace, it\u2019s a very strange mix of products and services,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cWe are seeing legal and illegal goods pop up. The legal goods are selling better than expected. One of the great things happening is people are buying from other countries where, in most cases, they tend not to do so on other platforms because it is too risky. There\u2019s not a lot of trust there on existing marketplaces, which makes it harder to sell goods across borders.\u201d Customers on OpenBazaar are also excited about not paying fees.\u00a0\nOverall, \u201cnothing crazy\u201d has happened on the OpenBazaar network, according to Hoffman. The moderation process, one of the main features of the platform, has gone smoothly, with \u201cmoderators stepping up and helping to do refunds, and helping things along, which is pretty unique. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s another marketplace out there where people are crowdsourcing support. That\u2019s where the community has come in,\u201d Hoffman told Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0\nOpenBazaar has three classes or \u201clayers\u201d of users: buyer, merchant \u2012 just like in regular ecommerce platforms \u2012 and also a moderator layer. Hoffman says the OB team has been surprised by buyer willingness to bypass the moderation layer.\n\u201cThe realization we\u2019ve come to is, a lot of people are more trusting than we assumed they\u2019d be,\u201d he said. \u201cWe designed the whole system so there would be a moderator to provide protection, but lots of people go to a store and they will try and find more about that storefront, then come back later and purchase directly.\u201d\u00a0\nOn OpenBazaar, users can find huge wall-size maps of planets (an atlas of Mars, for instance), as well as service-based stores, where someone will livestream and create a custom OB theme for storefronts for $5. While some have advertised goods such as tax-free cigarettes, illicit products have not fared well on the OB platform.\u00a0\n\u201cWe were prepared to see a lot of that,\u201d Hoffman said, \u201cbut we haven\u2019t really, so far.\u201d OpenBazaar promises no anonymity to users. There are fewer than five such stores on the platform.\u00a0\n\u201cI think they are just exploring,\u201d Hoffman speculates. \u201cThey don\u2019t look legitimate, and then they disappear. On the other hand, there is one store that is selling knock-off Viagra, which I don\u2019t believe is legal, but they\u2019re selling away on the marketplace and don\u2019t seem worried. It hasn\u2019t been super-problematic right now; obviously these kinds of things become an issue when they become bigger. The illicit businesses will then get the attention of law enforcement.\u201d\u00a0\nCurrently, in order to receive privacy, users must take steps on their end. \u201cIf you run the application out of the box,\u201d Hoffman says, \u201cyou are easily discoverable. If you are a little technical, you could pull a storefront\u2019s IP address out of the software and find out where [the seller is] at. Of course, sellers could run through multiple VPNs to avoid that.\u201d\u00a0\nThe level of difficulty to set up an OpenBazaar store is similar to that of other platforms, such as Shopify. OB isn\u2019t exactly targeting serious businesses: \u201cFor someone who wants to jump on craigslist, I think an app [like OB] is a very simple way to get involved. It takes you a few minutes to get a store up and running and get a listing.\u201d The desktop app, however, is just the first iteration of OB. Mobile is set to follow shortly after the release of desktop.\u00a0\nThe OB technology is more difficult to run on a mobile device than a desktop. \u201cWe have some thoughts on how to change that in the future,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cFor now, the desktop application is the primary way for people to use OB.\u201d Despite all the emphasis on the ecommerce functions of OpenBazaar, the site in many ways operates like a social media platform.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen we built the products, it seemed natural to have it wrap around the social media concept, because we knew that buyers and sellers were going to need to be engaging with each other to establish more trust,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cThey were going to need a chat function, and the moderator then also needs to be involved. There has to be this open discussion between all of them.\u201d\u00a0\nOB also wanted to incorporate ways for other storefronts to be promoted within the application.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a true marketplace,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cWhen we designed it, we wanted it to be very social. I think that is an important part of the future. People are already using platforms to sell, like Instagram, Twitter or Facebook. We don\u2019t want to build a social network, but we wanted to add the social features we think would be beneficial to the OB community.\u201d The open-source project hopes to expand that in the future. \u00a0\n\u201cWe want people to engage with their brand,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cSo if we have a really popular store on OB, in the future we will be able to blast out updates to followers along with coupon codes and notices of who is following you. Things like that, we will expand as we go.\u201d\u00a0\nOB intends to grow the community throughout the remainder of the year, turning now to OB1 \u2012 the project\u2019s own store on the platform, and the reason it earlier landed $1 million in venture capital. \u00a0According to Hoffman, that project might offer additional services to the OB ecosystem, such as search functions.\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 11}

The Zug area is known as the \"crypto-valley,\" as it hosts more than a dozen companies specializing in Bitcoin-related activities.\u00a0\nThe pilot project, officially approved on May 3, will start on July 1 and continue until the end of 2016. After an analysis of the results, the city will decide whether it wants to continue accepting Bitcoin payments in the future.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is the first time worldwide that bitcoins have been accepted as a currency on a state level,\u201d said Niklas Nikolajsen, co-founder and CEO of Bitcoin Suisse, a Bitcoin exchange based in Baar, not far from Zug.\u00a0\nEngadget notes that the project is an ideal testbed. Zug has a laissez-faire approach to its economy, even for the relatively market-libertarian climate of Switzerland. And it\u2019s an important financial center \u2012 3 percent of the world's oil trades through the area \u2012 with an innovative fintech sector.\u00a0\nFortune notes that the Zug initiative could be motivated by the low transaction costs offered by Bitcoin. In fact, the city is looking for ways to cut costs to compensate for the lack of income from taxes, which are very low.\nIn recent years entrepreneurs and programmers have made Zug\u2019s crypto-valley a leader in fintech and digital-currencies, according to the Greater Zurich area website. New trading markets, new encryption technologies or new digital currencies are being developed, with room for a wide spectrum of possibilities, including Bitcoin.\u00a0\nAmong the blockchain-based fintech companies active in the area, Monetas wants to develop a decentralized, global system for financial and legal transactions \u2013 lightning-fast, with very low transaction fees and without intermediaries. The Ethereum Foundation is also based in the area.\n\u201cWhen digital financial services first came about, we had to build a global center where you could find a safe and supportive environment for emerging technologies,\u201d said Monetas CEO Johann Gevers, referring to the vision to establish a crypto-valley in Zug.\u00a0\nSwitzerland has a long tradition of privacy, stable direct-democratic politics and top class computer expertise, including cryptography and security. The tax environment is extremely advantageous, and the regulatory environment is also favorable because digital currencies are treated as foreign currencies in Switzerland, which means that it\u2019s not necessary to create new laws and regulations, and digital currency trading is exempt from VAT. These are among the reasons Xapo, a provider of secure Bitcoin wallet and vault storage, decided to relocate its corporate headquarters to the Zurich area in 2015.\nNot everyone is persuaded that the initiative is a good idea. Representatives of the conservative-nationalist SVP party wrote to the city council inquiring about the legal basis for the council deciding which currencies it could accept.\u00a0\n\"It is highly concerning that a state institution should accept Bitcoin, since it is not a secure currency,\" city council member Gregor Bruhin told Neue Zuercher Zeitung. \"The city of Zug could undermine the status of cash with its actions.\"\u00a0\nMueller is much more optimistic: \"I can imagine that in the near future it will be possible to pay your tax bill with Bitcoin,\" he told the paper.\nThe Zug initiative is interesting because it\u2019s an official project of a city that, despite being small, managed to become an important financial center in the heart of Europe, and could be imitated by other cities \u2012 and even nations \u2012 in Europe and worldwide. A lot depends on the result of the pilot project, to be evaluated after the end of the year, and it seems likely that adoption by citizens will be the most important factor in deciding whether and how to continue and expand the project.", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 12}

In the past, BitPagos has become known in the Bitcoin community by enabling merchants in inflation-riddled countries, such as Serrano\u2019s birthplace of Argentina, to convert credit card payments into bitcoins.\nThey\u2019ve often been referred to as the opposite of BitPay, which is a Bitcoin payment processor that allows merchants to convert bitcoin payments into local currency within one business day of the sale.\nBitPagos\u2019 latest project is an attempt to bring a new type of credit system to the unbanked in countries such as Argentina, where much of the population does not have the ability to shop online. During his presentation, Serrano noted that online commerce accounts for only 2.2 percent of all the shopping taking place in Latin America.\nHow Does Ripio Work?\nRipio Credit allows its users to pay any bitcoin-accepting merchant in installments denominated in their local currency. After downloading the app, users are put through an application process that involves handing over some identifying information such as a picture of their government-issued ID and a selfie. The information provided by the user is reviewed to determine the creditworthiness of the applicant.\nDuring his presentation at TechCrunch Disrupt, Serrano stated, \u201cThis is a very difficult problem, but we have been working on these issues for several years \u2012 long before BitPagos.\u201d\nSerrano noted that most of the BitPagos team comes from other payment companies in the region such as Mercado Libre. BitPagos is essentially creating a new reputation system to determine whether individuals who usually are not banked (or offered credit) can gain access to credit through their app.\nEssentially, BitPagos is making bitcoin payments upfront for their users, while the users are responsible for paying back their purchase via Bitcoin, a bank account or local, physical cash payments.\nWhy Use Bitcoin?\nAfter his presentation, Serrano was asked to explain why Bitcoin was used at all. Serrano said:\n\n\u201cBitcoin is, for the merchant, a much better system: It\u2019s instantaneous [and] it has a much lower cost for processing. It also helps us build a [merchant] network that will give a lot more value to the user [from the start].\u201d\n\nAs an example of the efficiencies offered by Bitcoin, Serrano noted that Avalancha, a BitPagos ecommerce partner, offers a 10 percent discount for payments made with bitcoin. Serrano explained that the merchant is willing to give that discount because it is a \u201cbetter network.\u201d\nSerrano continued:\n\n\u201cIf [a merchant] processes with a credit card company in Argentina, he will get paid a month later in a country that has 20 percent inflation.\u201d\n\nHow Will BitPagos Fight Fraud?\nSerano also was asked how BitPagos\u2019 new app will be able to fight fraud. Serrano noted that fraud is something BitPagos has been battling against for a long time, and he believes it is not going to be a major issue going forward \u2012 mainly due to the company\u2019s experience in the past.\u00a0\n\u201cWe know a lot of the [traits] that a fraud user will have,\u201d he said.\nSerrano also mentioned that BitPagos\u2019 ability to determine the creditworthiness of a particular user will improve over time as the user\u2019s activity is monitored.\nImage via Ripio", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 13}

He has been a Bitcoin core developer and has worked for various other companies, such as BitPay. Recently, he started his own blockchain-as-a-service firm, Bloq, which will serve enterprise clients who wish to develop stems on a private, public or confederated blockchain.\u00a0\nIn a recent discussion with Bitcoin Magazine, Garzik expressed his belief that, currently, blockchain technology is moving from Step Three to Step Four in a model he crafted.\u00a0\n\u201cStep One is digital currency, the very first use case of blockchain,\u201d Garzik said.\nThat means Step One in the evolution of blockchain technology, as Garzik explains it, is obviously Bitcoin. Bitcoin, introduced in 2008, has caught the imagination of large swaths of the collective imagination, from major financial institutions to hackers in their mom\u2019s basements.\u00a0\nStep Two, which, according to Garzik, Bitcoin has already surpassed, includes companies researching how digital currencies \u2012 or tokens \u2012 can be used in interbank transfers. Financial institutions are doing this in order to make the modern methods of money transmission more efficient.\u00a0\nWhile credit cards and debit cards work well, people lament the need still for paper checks or wire transfers, which can take days. Moreover, the latter costs a large percentage of the overall transfer.\u00a0\nAs Garzik puts it: \u201cStep Two is digital assets, where you have financial institutions putting digital assets on the blockchain.\u201d\n\u201cStep Three is smart properties,\u201d Garzik said. \u201cPutting physical assets on a blockchain, whether it\u2019s a jet, a boat, a plane, real estate or something like that.\u201d This phase has been theorized about for years and the\u00a0mainstream media is undoubtedly catching on to things like how the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain can unite to power the cities of the future. For many, this comes down to managing property on the blockchain.\u00a0\nSmart property refers to ownership determined by blockchains with smart contracts. Smart property can also include shares in a company or access rights to a software or computer. Smart property streamlines the ownership process, diminishing the chances for fraud and reducing mediation costs.\nNick Szabo first introduced the notion of smart property in his 1998 paper, \u201cThe Idea of Smart Contracts.\u201d\u00a0\nThe blockchain industry \u2012 which in Garzik\u2019s mind includes at its heart the Bitcoin technology \u2012 is moving into an exciting phase: Step Four.\u00a0\n\u201cStep Four ties all of that together into a mesh network of cross-chain smart contracts that guard the assets and the assets mature,\u201d Garzik said. \u201cReally move beyond simple encryption needs for managing and securing assets. Right now, I think we are moving from Step Three to Step Four with some of the exciting things going on in the Ethereum community and similar technologies on the smart contract side. With Rootstock most notably, similar [things are] happening on the Bitcoin side as well.\u201d\u00a0\nIt\u2019s this development that is \u201cexciting to me in the very near term,\u201d Garzik said.\u00a0\nBloq recently launched its Blockchain Operating System, called BloqEnterprise, which is designed as an enterprise-grade blockchain backend with customer service. This \u201cmulti-pronged blockchain software solution is designed to give users the ability to create, update, customize and analyze their own public, private and permissioned blockchains.\u201d\u00a0\nGarzik partnered with Matthew Roszak in November 2015 on Bloq.\u00a0\n\u201cOpen source is key to rapid innovation,\u201d said Garzik, \u201cand this has been true of both the early days of Linux and cryptocurrency. But at some point, there needs to be an enterprise-grade solution for a technology to be reliable enough to play in the Fortune 500. You can\u2019t sit around and hope that unpaid volunteers come up with an update. Red Hat solved this problem for the Linux market, and Bloq will solve it for the blockchain.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 13}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nMost people in the Bitcoin community know Paul Sztorc for his work on the Truthcoin concept (now backed by Roger Ver and currently in development as Bitcoin Hivemind), but the former Yale statistician also recently joined blockchain startup Bloq (of which Bitcoin Core contributor Jeff Garzik is a co-founder) under the role of economist.\nIn a recent message to the Bitcoin development mailing list, Sztorc attempted to jump-start the conversation on a potential BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) to enable two-way pegged sidechains on the Bitcoin network.\nSztorc noted the inclusion of a new opcode (currently going by the name OP_CheckVotesVerify) that could be added to Bitcoin via a soft fork. Although the main purpose of his email was to kick off the technical discussion around a specific two-way peg implementation, Sztorc also noted four of the key benefits that sidechains may bring to Bitcoin.\n1. Optional Hard Forks\nThe first benefit of sidechains mentioned by Sztorc was what he called \u201coptional hard forks.\u201d He noted, \u201cSidechains allow 'opt in' adoption of new features.\u201d\nIn addition to allowing innovation to take place that would usually happen on a blockchain in an alternative cryptocurrency (altcoin) network, Sztorc added that the changes to Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules found in Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin XT could also be implemented as sidechains.\nWhen those alternative protocol designs are implemented as sidechains, it makes the changes optional because users can still decide to remain on the main Bitcoin blockchain. If Bitcoin Classic or Bitcoin XT were implemented via a hard fork (activated by 75 percent support from the network hashrate), it would essentially coerce everyone on the network to play by these new rules.\n2. Staging Upgrades\nAccording to Sztorc, sidechains also allow Bitcoin to be upgraded in stages. He explained:\n\n\u201cSidechains allow complex updates to Bitcoin to be tested in a realistic environment (where actual BTC are at risk and utilizing actual network mining resources). If these updates fail, they can be revised; if they succeed, they can be incorporated into the mainchain.\u201d\n\nCurrently, new features are not tested on the live Bitcoin network. Instead, test networks are created to try out new features without risking large amounts of real value. For a large portion of the Bitcoin community, including Sztorc, altcoins are mainly viewed as testnets.\n3. Directing Blockchain Resources to Bitcoin\nWith the flexibility offered by sidechains, it makes more sense for resources (developers, money, public attention, etc.) to be directed toward the Bitcoin currency network. Instead of splitting the idea of cryptocurrency into many different networks, sidechains allow the vast majority of the innovation to take place on the same network. In this regard, sidechains are intended to strengthen Bitcoin\u2019s network effects.\n4. Returning to a Culture of Permissionless Innovation\nOne last benefit of sidechains mentioned by Sztorc was that, with this improvement to Bitcoin, more time can be spent on permissionless innovation.\nSidechains mean \u201cless time spent debating controversial features,\u201d he said.\nThis final point ties in with the first point of optional hard forks. With sidechains, consensus from the entire network is not needed to try out something new.\nWhat Happens Next?\nAlthough the sidechains concept has received large amounts of interest and praise from the Bitcoin community (both technical and otherwise), doubts still exist. Most notably, Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd has voiced his concerns over the security of merge-mined sidechains.\nAs recently as this month, Todd has said, \u201c[Merge-mined sidechains] are a broken idea that fundamentally means miners have the ability to steal coins, and makes the scaling problem a lot worse.\u201d\nBitcoin Foundation Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen (who often disagrees with Todd\u2019s point of view) also sees possible issues with sidechains. In a recent AMA on 8btc, Andresen wrote, \u201cI think sidechains are a good idea, but the main problem is finding a good way to keep them secure.\u201d\nThe most recent work in regard to a two-way peg mechanism for sidechains comes in the form of a paper by RSK Labs (the company behind Rootstock) co-founder and Chief Scientist Sergio Lerner. The paper builds on work by Blockstream on the original sidechains concept and a more-recent proposal, drivechains, from Sztorc.", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 16}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nMicropayments have been touted as one of Bitcoin\u2019s main use cases since the early days of the technology, and a recent trial of the Bitcoin-powered content platform PopChest by YouTube Star NurdRage indicates that these claims may not be overblown.\u00a0\nNurdRage has been testing out various alternative content monetization schemes lately, and a test of PopChest generated a 400 percent increase in revenue for the science-focused YouTube channel.\nPast Tests With Bitcoin-Focused Content\nThe early testing ground for PopChest\u2019s micropayments-based content monetization model has been TheProtocol.TV. Although people can see how Bitcoin-powered micropayments could work in theory, the reality is that not many people are holding bitcoins right now. TheProtocol.TV provided PopChest with a useful testing ground, which focused on content generated for those who are likely to already hold bitcoins.\nTheProtocol.TV has been able to achieve some early success with content focused at individuals who are interested in Bitcoin or blockchain technology. An interview with Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin has generated 225 paid views at 49 cents each.\nNurdRage Gets Positive Results\nThe real test for PopChest took place earlier this year when the startup ventured out of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin Magazine recently caught up with PopChest CEO and co-founder Valerian Bennett to get the results from this experiment. Bennett was able to lay out the data related to NurdRage\u2019s use of the PopChest platform:\n\u201cOn average, his previous 10 YouTube videos got around 40,000 views \u2012 worth about $50 each. We got 800 paid views at 25 cents per, which equates to $200. So two percent of his audience produced four times the revenue.\u201d\nThis project has been helpful in PopChest\u2019s attempt to promote its platform outside of the Bitcoin community.\n\u201cThe cool thing is his content isn't Bitcoin-specific,\u201d Bennett said.\nAnother sidenote shared by Bennett was that the majority of the traffic to NurdRage\u2019s PopChest portal came from YouTube. Some content creators use YouTube as sort of an advertisement for their own content portals. Bennett went into further detail on the YouTube-based strategy:\n\u201cUsing \u2018influencer marketing\u2019 techniques, we were able to set up more than 300 fans with their first Bitcoin wallet through a link provided directly in NurdRage\u2019s YouTube comments section. We didn\u2019t need \u2018everyone\u2019 to have bitcoins, we just needed his most passionate followers to have bitcoins.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s Next for PopChest?\nDuring Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s conversation with Bennett, the topic of the Brave browser also came up. Bennett noted that he\u2019s the local meetup organizer for Brave in Los Angeles.\nSimilar to Brave\u2019s monetization model, PopChest\u2019s development roadmap also includes a plan to allow viewers to earn money by watching ad-supported videos (as opposed to paying for commercial-free videos). This sort of activity is already popular in some smartphone-based games where users watch advertisements in exchange for game tokens. On PopChest, users would be paid in bitcoins, which means much more flexibility is offered in terms of what can be done with the earnings.\nPopChest also just launched its own YouTube-style portal last week. Bennett is hoping it will encourage more publishers to use the micropayments platform. Additionally, the PopChest player now has Chromecast support, which lets viewers pay for videos with bitcoins and immediately watch them on their televisions. Support for other devices, such as AppleTV and Roku, is slated for the future.\nFor now, improvements to Bitcoin micropayments are still needed for PopChest to reach its full potential. The startup is looking forward to the development of layer-2 protocols, such as the Lightning Network and payment channels, which could allow for instantly-confirmed, sub-penny transactions with extremely low fees.\u00a0\n\u201cBeing able to back up the promise of Bitcoin micropayments with hard data is an exciting accomplishment for PopChest,\u201d Bennett told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cNow, the goal is to get these tools in front of as many content creators as possible to build a truly open platform with micropayments at its core. Publishers will make more money and viewers can opt-out of watching commercials to reclaim their most valuable asset: their time.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 17}

Micah Winkelspecht, the founder and CEO of Gem, said in a recent interview with Venture Nashville that the decision to increase the company's focus on health care was made after a six-month period of growing interest from the industry.\u00a0\nBetter Records for Better Care\nCurrently, most hospitals have closed bookkeeping, which prohibits information learned in one corner of the world to quickly be sent to another. It can also limit the speed that information one doctor learns to be passed to his or her colleagues. This can especially present a challenge for people who relocate or become sick when they travel and are unable to connect with their local doctor to retrieve their medical records.\u00a0\nAnd an enormous amount of new medical research is introduced every year. It can be extremely difficult for any doctor or group of doctors to keep up with the newly released content or old practices that become outdated. It can even be difficult for doctors to determine whether a practice they read about in a new medical document is even accurate until they test the material for themselves.\u00a0\nWinkelspecht explained in a guest post in the Distributed Ledger that integrating the blockchain into the health care sector has made it possible to \u201cbuild a global repository of data in the industry that each party can trust reliably.\u201d Every company has access to the same data that is shared transparently so that there is only one log of events that everyone agrees is the truth.\nThe Future of Decentralized Health Care Technology\nGem already has several clients in the health care sector, Winkelspecht told Venture Nashville, and the blockchain resources being developed for them are in the proof-of-concept stage. He admits that a concept in development includes \u201cuniversal health care records\u201d and suggests that other blockchain health care advancements will include \u201csupport of claims processing and management, transport of Internet of Things (IoT) data from health care devices to patient profiles, workflow simplification backed-up by \"smart contracts,\" and new approaches for medical-prescription documentation and fraud reduction, among many other opportunities.\u201d\u00a0\nWinkelspecht predicts that blockchains gaining traction in the health care industry will likely disrupt existing data centers because a blockchain provides data accessibility from both patients and health care professionals, as well as guaranteeing that sensitive information remains secure and the information is not altered or used nefariously.\u00a0\nWinkelspecht also stressed his company\u2019s focus on blockchains and their impact on the health care industry, rather than Bitcoin and other currencies. The blockchain is a powerful tool that enables the advancement of technology not only within, but across every industry, he explained.\n\u201cBlockchain-enabled data integrity will open the door to the next great commercial technological disruption because it allows for frictionless, trusted communication among nontrusting parties,\u201d\u00a0Winkelspecht said. Along with financial services, health care is one of the earliest and most promising blockchain use case application opportunities.", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 17}

The DAO wants to be a model for a new kind of organization, created and run using blockchain software rather than conventional corporate structures.\nThe DAO \u2012 an acronym for Distributed Autonomous Organization \u2012 is similar to an open venture capital fund based on Ethereum smart contracts. Everyone can purchase DAO voting shares, called DAO tokens, with ETH (the currency unit of the Ethereum blockchain). Shares in The DAO can be purchased using ETH until May 28th. The Fortune article emphasizes that The DAO, concerned with possible regulatory issues, states its tokens are not a form of equity.\nVentureBeat notes that The DAO is structured as a series of smart contracts granting token holders voting rights (somewhat similar to more traditional corporate equity) and \u201ccontrol\u201d over their proportion of invested ETH. The DAO\u2019s infrastructure enables voting on any sort of expenditure the organization could make (such as hiring and paying contractors to work on their proposals, investing the ETH fund into another asset, and even \u201csplitting\u201d the DAO).\n\u201cThe DAO\u2019s inception last Saturday led to both the highest increase of new accounts and the highest ever number of Ethereum transactions,\u201d wrote Stephan Tual in May 6 in an article titled \u201cThe Inexorable Rise of The DAO.\u201d Today, the DAO is about to become the largest crowdfunded project in human history, noted Erik Voorhees on May 14. \u201cTo say the DAO is a momentous event in the history of Ethereum, and blockchains in general, is an understatement,\u201d added Tual.\nThe DAO is a for-profit Distributed Autonomous Organization that wants to leverage the wisdom of the crowds to benefit DAO Token Holders. According to The DAO\u2019s Manifesto, the project wants to blaze a new path in business organization for the betterment of its members, existing simultaneously nowhere and everywhere and operating solely with the steadfast iron will of immutable code. The goal of The DAO is to diligently use the ETH it controls to support projects that will provide a return on investment or benefit to the DAO and its members, and benefit the decentralized ecosystem as a whole.\nAny DAO Token Holder can submit a proposal to the DAO, which can offer services that directly benefit it (improvement to the DAO code or addition of a GUI for example), or indirectly generate rewards to the DAO (in the form of a product or service). Proposals are written in plain English and backed by a software code in the form of a smart contract that defines the relationship between The DAO and the contractor: deliverables, responsibilities and operating parameters. Accepting a proposal requires a majority decision after a debating period of two weeks minimum, and a participation rate of 20 percent or higher calculated proportionally to the value of ETH requested in the proposal.\nThe German startup Slock.it,\u00a0specializing in blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, submitted one of the proposals currently being discussed by The DAO. As reported by Bitcoin Magazine in December the company is realizing Nick Szabo\u2019s vision of smart contracts embedded in IoT-enabled devices, with smart locks linked to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\u201cIf you can lock it, we will let you rent, sell or share it,\u201d promises the company\u2019s website. \u201cWhen someone purchases a Slock, it will be connected to the Slock smart contract in the Ethereum blockchain and controlled by it,\u201d said Slock.it co-founder Christoph Jentzsch. Slock submitted to The DAO an ambitious Internet of Things (IoT) + Blockchain proposal centered on the Ethereum Computer, a multi-functional device designed to decentralize the sharing economy.\nJentzsch authored a DAO Whitepaper, which is considered a reference document for The DAO. \u201cThe DAO will be deployed as an exact implementation of the Standard DAO Framework,\u201d notes The DAO\u2019s website. \u201cThe Whitepaper therefore describes perfectly how the DAO functions and is a great place to start learning more.\u201d\nAnother proposal to The DAO, submitted by Mobotiq, outlines a vision of modular electric vehicles that can be rented P2P, which is a perfect fit for the blockchain. Integration with Ethereum could enable the development of fully autonomous, self-renting vehicles.\nThe DAO has a distributed open governance structure, which seems to leave a door open to hostile takeovers by 51 percent attacks. As a failsafe mechanism to prevent that, there are \u201ccurators\u201d who monitor compliance and control the whitelist, the list of contractors authorized to receive ETH from the DAO. Curators do not add centralization to the DAO; they are nominated by the DAO Token Holders themselves, and can be fired at any time, for any reason. The current DAO\u2019s curator multisig holders include Vitalik Buterin and other leaders in the Ethereum space.\nInternet entrepreneur and activist David Orban, co-founder and moderator of the popular Facebook group \u201cBitcoin and the Internet of Money\u201d thinks there are important reasons to invest in The DAO, besides the possibility of a good financial return.\u00a0\n\u201c[Participation in The DAO] doesn't imply or promise that the exchange rate of DAO Tokens and ETH with any other digital or fiat currency should increase in favor of DAO,\u201d says Orban. \u201cOn the other hand, just participating, with any even minuscule amount, allows the acquisition of hands-on knowledge in what aims to be a revolutionary platform for decentralized project management and resource allocation.\u201d\nOrban is persuaded that The DAO can be a pathfinder and a model for very ambitious crowdfunded initiatives to tackle important challenges, including a new global phase of the space program. \u201cWith The \u0110AO now being implemented this is starting to make sense,\u201d says Orban. \u201cFrom the $10M order of magnitude crowdsales two years ago, to the $100M crowdsale today, we will get to $1B in a couple of years, and then to $10B in another two-three. Those are meaningful numbers to fund a Mars mission (if not a Mars colony yet).\u201d\u00a0\nSee also this author\u2019s 2009 essay on \u201cA Virtual World Space Agency,\u201d which didn\u2019t mention DAOs only because the concept wasn\u2019t yet popular at the time.", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 16}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nAs of this weekend,\u00a0GreenAddress\u00a0is the first Bitcoin wallet to include\u00a0a replace-by-fee option. With it, users can increase fees on their transactions with the click of a button--a feature welcomed by some, as it increases the likelihood a miner will include a transaction in a block. This can help transactions get \u201cunstuck\u201d in case of heavy transaction load, and benefits fee market dynamics. Others dispute the feature; critics fear that replace-by-fee could harm reliability of unconfirmed transactions, as payments can in some cases be reverted.\nTo test the feature, GreenAddress enabled a preview of the option on my own GreenAddress wallet several weeks ago. This, in turn, allowed me to test which parts of the broader Bitcoin ecosystem are ready for replace-by-fee \u2013 and which parts are not.\nThe results below are based on ad hoc experimentation from my own perspective as a user \u2013 not an official analysis conducted with scientific precision.\nGreenAddress from the Sender\u2019s Perspective\nThe first test, of course, was GreenAddress itself, from the sender's perspective. (Tested on the Chrome extension version of the wallet.)\nSince this weekend, the GreenAddress replace-by-fee option is switched on by default. (Users that don\u2019t want to utilize the feature need to disable it in the \u201cSettings\u201d panel.) When switched on, each transaction sent from the wallet includes a replace-by-fee flag. This way, network nodes and miners know it's eligible to be replaced by a conflicting transaction that includes a higher fee.\nAfter sending my first replace-by-fee transaction, I was automatically redirected to the \u201cTransactions\u201d screen, where all past wallet-transactions are displayed. And, underneath the (still unconfirmed) replace-by-fee transaction, a new tab had appeared: \u201cbump fee.\u201d\nWhile opt-in replace-by-fee as included in Bitcoin Core allows replacing any unconfirmed transaction (even if this means unconfirmed transactions are \u201ccanceled\u201d), GreenAddress users can only resend bitcoins from the same inputs to the same outputs, but with a higher fee. It only allows users to \u201cboost\u201d a transaction to increase the likelihood a miner will include it in a block.\nClicking on the \u201cbump fee\u201d tab opens a mini-menu. On top of the menu, text displays how fast the transaction is expected to confirm. In my case, it was expected to be included in the next block. Nevertheless, the menu allowed me to bump the fee: times 1.5, times 2 or times 3.\n\nHowever, and more important, if a transaction is not expected to be mined in the first available block because the fee is too low, GreenAddress offers a different option. In that case, the mini-menu offers users the option to include a fee big enough to have the transaction included in the next two, three or six blocks.\n\nHaving bumped the fee, a new icon appears underneath the transaction, which reads \u201cupdated,\u201d accompanied by a button to display the old transaction ID. Meanwhile, the \u201cbump fee\u201d button is still there, too, meaning I could bump the fee once again.\nAll in all a very straightforward and easy-to-use process.\nWhat the Pools Are Doing\nWallet software in itself is not sufficient to replace transactions. (Or: bump fees.) Whether replace-by-fee is active on the Bitcoin network really depends on miners.\nA series of test transactions revealed that a majority of miners currently does not apply any replace-by-fee policy. All of the big Chinese pools \u2013 AntPool, F2Pool, BTCC and BW.com \u2013 ignored the fee boosted transactions completely, as did KnCMiner. This currently adds up to more than 75 percent of hash power on the network.\nOther pools did apply a replace-by-fee policy, presumably the opt-in version. These include BitFury, Slush Pool, BitClub and CKPool, which adds up to nearly 20 percent of all hash power. (The other 5 percent of hash power on the network is controlled by pools or miners representing less than 1 percent of hash power, which didn\u2019t happen to mine any blocks during my tests..)\nSo what does this mean?\nWhile 20 percent may seem low, it's actually not so bad when keeping in mind the main purpose of replace-by-fee: \u201cboosting\u201d a fee to ensure a transaction is mined.\u00a0\nOf course, with only 20 percent of hash power applying a replace-by-fee policy, there\u2019s only a 20 percent chance the very next miner will pick up the boosted transaction. But there is also about a 3-out-of-4 chance that the boosted transaction will be included in a block within one hour. And it will almost certainly be included in a block within several hours.\nNeedless to say, that is a significant improvement compared to transactions that won't confirm for days, as has been the case during some \u201cstress tests\u201d on the network.\nUsers who want to (ab)use replace-by-fee to revert an unconfirmed transaction, meanwhile, only have about a 20 percent chance this will succeed. At least 75 percent of the time they\u2019ll pay their \u201cvictim\u201d even though they didn\u2019t want to. (Reverting a transaction isn\u2019t possible with GreenAddress in the first place, of course.)\nWallet Security\nUsers maliciously reverting unconfirmed transactions bring us to the next point.\nTo counter these risks, wallet software can warn users on the receiving end of a transaction if a transaction is flagged to potentially be replaced.\nOf all tested wallets, however, only Mycelium (on Android) and \u2013 indeed \u2013 GreenAddress (Chrome app) show such a flag. Both wallets clearly visualize a replace-by-fee enabled transaction as such, giving users the option not to accept such a transaction until confirmed if they wish. (AirBitz apparently does it too, but I don\u2019t have the right operating system to test this myself.)\n\nInterestingly, Bitcoin Core doesn't flag for incoming opt-in replace-by-fee transactions, and as such Bitcoin Core forks Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Unlimited don't either. Rather, these wallets simply show both the original and the replacement transaction as unconfirmed. Until one of these transactions makes it into a block, of course, at which point the confirmed transaction is shown as confirmed - and the conflicting transaction as rejected.\nBlockchain (web), Bither (iOS 7), Blocktrail (iOS 7 and web), Breadwallet (iOS 7), Coinbase (web), Copay (iOS 7) and Electrum (desktop) don't flag for replace-by-fee transactions either. Blocktrail, Bither and Breadwallet simply show both the original and the boosted transactions as two different incoming transactions, while Copay and Coinbase ignore the latter. For Electrum, it depends on which Electrum server the wallet software connects to, but in most cases it shows only the newest transaction.\n(When asked why their software doesn't flag for replace-by-fee transactions, both Bitcoin Core and Electrum developers explained that unconfirmed transactions shouldn't be trusted either way, and a flagging system could give users a false sense of security.)\nEditors note: Shortly before publication, Bitcoin Core developers pointed out that an RBF-notification might be added soon, after all.\nWhile unable to test it myself, Bitcoin Wallet (Android) applies yet another strategy: it doesn't show replace-by-fee flagged transactions at all, unless and until it has at least one confirmation.\u00a0\n(Bitcoin Wallet developer Andreas Schildbach told me adding a flagging system in the software would be tricky, and he believes this is the most responsible solution for now.)\nPayment Processors\nI tested the big two payment processors: BitPay and Coinbase. This time around, I didn't actually try to replace (\u201cboost\u201d) my transaction. I just wanted to see how they'd handle the flag.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly \u2013 CEO Stephen Pair supports opt-in replace-by-fee \u2013 BitPay seemed to handle replace-by-fee payments without any problems. Having paid for a pizza delivery through Bitcoin's biggest payment processor, the order was immediately confirmed on-screen. As such, it didn't feel like I was waiting too long for my transaction to come through.\nIt did, however, take several minutes \u2013 seemingly until a block was found \u2013 until I also received a confirmation email. Presumably this is because BitPay\u00a0does\u00a0wait \u201cbehind the screens\u201d until a transaction is included in a block, to make sure they can't be defrauded.\nWhile it worked well for me, it did leave me wondering what would happen if the transaction had taken significantly longer to confirm. If that would have meant I had to wait longer for my pizza to arrive, a warning might have been in place...\nCoinbase did not handle my first replace-by-fee transaction well: my payment for Reddit Gold, made several weeks ago, was not acknowledged at all. Not before it was included in a block, and not after it was included in a block. After seeing the payment request page time out twice, the order was eventually canceled. (I had to email Reddit to get my gold.)\nHowever, a second, more recent try suggests Coinbase has improved its service since: my Wikimedia donation was confirmed instantly. Moreover, a message popped up telling me they\u2019d wait for a confirmation due to a low fee. Wrong reason, but right service.\n\nBlock Explorers\nFinally, I did a quick round to see how different block explorers handle opt-in replace-by-fee transactions.\nThe first block explorer I tested, Blocktrail, clearly visualizes replace-by-fee transactions. It was the only block explorer that not only flags a transaction when eligible for double-spends, it also warns users if a conflicting transaction is detected. And, once that conflicting transaction is included in a block, it's made clear that the replaced transaction was double-spent, and won't confirm.\n\nBlockchain.info does not flag replaceable transactions, and instead just shows a transaction as unconfirmed. It's only after a conflicting transaction is sent that Blockchain.info visualizes a note warning users of a potential double-spend, though still no mention of replace-by-fee. And, after a conflicting transaction is included in a block, Blockchain.info issues no additional warning; it seems as if there is still a small chance the original transaction might confirm.\nAs for other block explorers ...\nMuch like Blockchain.info, Blockcypher does not visualize a replace-by-fee flag, but it does show a double-spend warning after a second transaction is sent. BitPay's open source block explorer insight.bitpay.com, bitcoinchain.com and chain.so show only the first initial transaction, with no replace-by-fee flag.", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 17}

The project, part of the Brooklyn Microgrid \u2012 a distributed energy development group in the Park Slope and Gowanus communities of Brooklyn, creating a connected network for local energy \u2012 also shows how distributed ledger technology could enable the emerging \"energy Internet.\"\nThe project starts small: \u201cOn one side of President Street, five homes with solar panels generate electricity. On the other side, five homes buy power when the opposite homes don't need it. In the middle is a blockchain network, managing and recording transactions with little human interaction.\u201d But the idea is big, and could represent the future of community-managed energy systems.\nThe project, called TransActive Grid, is a joint venture between Brooklyn Microgrid developer LO3 Energy and blockchain technology developer ConsenSys, a startup focused on Ethereum applications, whose partnership with Microsoft for cloud-based blockchain applications has been recently covered by Bitcoin Magazine.\n\"We're setting up a market on this street for renewable electrons to test if people are interested in buying them from each other,\" says LO3's founder Lawrence Orsini. \"If you produce energy far away, there's a lot of losses, and you don't get the value of those electrons. But if they're right across the street, there's a lot of environmental and system efficiency that's being realized from being very close to one another.\"\nThe Transactive Grid is a pilot project that, if successful, could be extended to the whole Brooklyn Microgrid. According to Orsini, 130 homes have expressed interest so far. Orsini\u2019s key point \u2012 that the local exchanges enabled by smart energy grids can be much more efficient and environmentally friendly than traditional top-down energy distribution systems \u2012 could permit important overall cost savings, benefit society as a whole and demonstrate the power of distributed ledgers.\nTransActive Grid includes a hardware layer of smart meters and a software layer using the blockchain and smart contracts \u2012 self-enforcing contracts on the Ethereum blockchain which provide an auditable, non-repudiable and cryptographically secure history of automated transactions. The participants\u2019 homes are equipped \u00a0with smart meters linked to the blockchain to track the electricity generated and used in the homes and manage transactions between neighbors.\n\u201cThe microgrid project is developing distributed power generation and storage assets in the physical world while ConsenSys is building an Ethereum-enabled platform layer in the digital world on top of which the business logic can reside so that we can begin to explore empowering participants within the microgrid to transact with each other peer-to-peer,\u201d notes John Lilic, a ConsenSys specialist who works at the intersection of blockchain technology and energy markets.\nLilic explains how the energy meter data from the participants within the microgrid becomes an oracle that feeds into Consensys\u2019 token issuance and management system to create tokens representing the electricity surplus generated by the prosumers\u2019 solar arrays. The tokens, which indicate that a certain amount of energy was produced from a renewable energy source, can be transacted on the blockchain and transferred from one smart meter wallet to another.\n\u201cProsumers\u201d \u2012 producers and consumers at the same time \u2012 is a new buzzword that is becoming popular in the emerging sharing economy. In the TransActive Grid concept, prosumers can control their own local energy: Consumers can choose whether to buy energy from their neighbors or other renewable energy sources. Home energy producers can sell their surplus to their neighbors, and communities can keep energy resources local, reducing dissipation and increasing micro and macro grid efficiency.\nIt seems evident that the application development focus in the blockchain world is shifting from payments and financial applications to smart contract-based management of physical resources in the Internet of Things (IoT), of which networked smart energy meters represent an instance.\nBlockchain technology, which is decentralized, secure and self-executing, permits developing sophisticated data networks for efficient, self-executing community management of energy networks. \u201cIt could be what finally allows us to shift from a top-down energy system of big power plants to a two-way system of local control and greater self-reliance,\u201d concludes Fact Coexist.", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 25}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nLawmakers and regulators in the United States could be doing a much better job attracting innovative fintech startups to the country, Coin Center Executive Director Jerry Brito said at a recent cryptocurrency-focused event hosted by the Cato Institute.\nAlthough the United States started out as the leader in Bitcoin regulation, it is now falling behind other jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, where innovation in fintech and digital currency is being embraced with open arms.\nThe U.S. Has Been a Leader in Bitcoin Regulation\nIn 2013, the U.S. Senate held the first hearings on Bitcoin. In that same year, FinCEN released the first announcement by any government agency related to the technology. The IRS was also the first tax agency in the world to clarify the tax treatment of Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Additionally, BitLicense in New York was the first licensing regime in the world directed at digital currencies.\n\u201cAlthough certainly imperfect, each of these pronouncements brought clarity and certainty to an emerging industry, and these approaches were copied around the world,\u201d Brito said at the Cato event.\nOther Countries Are Going Further\nBrito also noted that the United States\u2019 role as the regulatory leader for Bitcoin around the world is not guaranteed to last.\u00a0\nOther countries are beginning to start regulatory regimes that don\u2019t merely tolerate cryptocurrency firms, but welcome them with open arms, he said.\nBrito pointed to the United Kingdom as a specific example of a country looking to foster growth in the digital currency space:\n\n\u201cThe U.K., for example, has created a regulatory framework that bends over backward to make it easy and quick for innovative startups and entrepreneurs to comply with the appropriate consumer protection regulations and safely enter the market.\u201d\n\nProject innovate was an initiative Brito used to bring home his point about the U.K.\u2019s embracement of fintech. This project offers dedicated teams to startups to make sure they understand the various regulations that apply to them.\nOnce a business is regulated in the U.K., it\u2019s also able to operate throughout the rest of the European Union. Brito pointed to Circle\u2019s recent partnership with Barclays as an example of this sort of regulatory structure creating an environment for more connections between startups and the traditional banking system.\nIn the past, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne has stated that the plan is to make London \u201cthe global center for fintech. ... The race is on, but we are determined to win it.\u201d\nCurrent Status of Regulation in the U.S.\nSo how is the U.S. doing in comparison to the U.K.?\nBrito said that only one BitLicense has been issued (to Circle), and at least 27 companies are still waiting in line for approval. He also noted that efforts to offer regulatory clarity, such as digital currency legislation in California, have stalled. Brito added that Coin Center is currently working with legislators in half a dozen states on various proposals for the regulation of digital currencies.\nAnother key issue often brought up on the regulation of fintech firms in the United States is that a different license is required for practically every state.\u00a0\n\n\u201cNot only is this time-consuming and costly, but the states have not all explained if and how cryptocurrency businesses need to comply,\u201d Brito said. \u201cAt the federal level, we only see the most tentative steps toward a pro-innovation agenda.\u201d\n\nWhat Can the U.S. Do Differently?\nIn addition to pointing out the current issues with digital currency regulation in the United States, Brito also offered some possible solutions.\n\n\u201cSerious action by federal banking regulators [is needed] to make it clear to banks that it\u2019s perfectly fine \u2012 and even encouraged \u2012 to establish relationships with innovative fintech and digital currency firms,\u201d he said.\n\nBrito also pointed out the obvious need to create a new regulatory environment where startups are not forced to get a license from every state in which they wish to operate.\n\u201cPolitically, these options are uphill battles, but if we don\u2019t think big, somebody else will,\u201d he said.\n\u00a0\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

The decision comes after \u00a0Otto de Voogd had evidently exercised his right to remain silent over the course of two years.\u00a0\nIn February 2014, de Voogd\u2019s BTC.ee announced it \u201ctemporarily stopped trading due to threats issued by Estonian police.\u201d The Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit and Border Guard Board emailed de Voogd, demanding details about the company\u2019s registration, anti-money laundering procedures and other due diligence processes \u2012 proof that he was operating in accordance with the law.\nIf he failed to comply, de Voogd faced three years in prison and a maximum fine of \u00a032,000 euros. But authorities never brought formal charges against de Voogd, who calls himself a \u201cBitcoin hobbyist.\u201d\u00a0\nDe Voogd crowdsourced a small part of his legal battle. (He keeps an overview of expenses and donations here.)\u00a0\nHe told Bitcoin Magazine he worried that if he provided the information requested by the authorities it could be used against him in court. Estonia previously charged another person for trading 2,000 euros worth of bitcoins. De Voogd, who has had approximately 9,000 euros in lawyers fees and 1,000 euros in donations, indicates his trades totaled a modestly higher amount.\nHe admits to profiting from the sale of bitcoins \u2012 to the tune of about 270 euros. Many traders in the space make approximately one percent profit. A Bitcoiner from the Netherlands, de Voogd claims Estonia acted in violation of European Law by extending anti-money laundering laws to Bitcoin without justifying and registering the changes with the European Commission.\u00a0\nThroughout his trial, de Voogd claimed a \u201csystematic attempt by Estonia to thwart Bitcoin.\u201d He cites an imposed VAT on the total value of Bitcoin, which differs from other European nations which impose VAT mostly on margin or profit.\u00a0\n\u201cEvery step of the way Estonia did the utmost,\u201d de Voogd says,\u201cto hinder and hamper Bitcoin use, and by extension all other blockchain-based tokens and assets.\u201d\nIn an April decision regarding de Voogd\u2019s case, Estonia\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that Bitcoin trading is subject to anti-money laundering regulation and state supervision.\nThe Estonian Supreme Court determined Bitcoin trading would be regulated by the nation\u2019s anti-money laundering legislation.\n\u201cEstonia is trying to heavily restrict the use of Bitcoin,\u201d de Voogd said. \u201cIncluding the requirement to meet customers in person, as well as the requirement keep IDs of all customers and report those who trade more than 1,000 euros more per month.\u201d Estonia is the only European Union nation to apply such strict requirements to Bitcoin.\u00a0\nWhen BTC.ee was shut down by law enforcement agencies in 2014, de Voogd demanded clarification of the nation\u2019s laws. BTC.ee\u2019s volume of all the trades over the course of one year was below the normal European Union anti-money laundering reporting threshold for a single transaction, de Voogd told Bitcoin Magazine. Most transactions were under 100 euros worth, he says.\u00a0\n\u201cThe whole purpose of my activity was to help people get started by trying some Bitcoin, so people coming in to ask questions and buy a small amount was great,\u201d de Voogd said. \u201cBut it was not a profitable activity, not even worth the time I spent on it. If you add that **** that Estonia created over my trading, it was certainly not worth it.\u201d\nBitcoin aside, Estonia appears to be a leader in digital innovation. Bitcoin Magazine \u00a0has covered the nation\u2019s E-Residency program. But, in discussions about Bitcoin regulation, Estonia takes a hardline approach. For instance, it was the only country in favor of VAT on Bitcoin in the European Court of Justice. Germany and Sweden argued in favor of a VAT on only the service fee. Estonia did not get its way. The court ruled Bitcoin exempt from VAT.\u00a0\nDe Voogd doesn\u2019t live in Estonia anymore. He plans to lodge a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights regarding \u201cthe violation of my privilege against self-incrimination, among other things.\u201d He no longer considers Estonia a Western nation.\u00a0\n\u201cOne should act with the same caution one would in Russia, and make sure you have explicit permission to do something before you do anything,\u201d he warns. \u201cPermissionless innovation is not part of their system, you must wait until something is explicitly authorized.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 26}

The idea has been around for a long time, though. Nick Szabo, the cryptographer known for his research on digital currency, wrote an article about smart contracts as early as 1995. Szabo\u2019s article, \u201cSmart Contracts,\u201d was published in early 1996 in the magazine Extropy, and forecast with prescient accuracy the benefits and parameters of the blockchain contract applications in development and making blockchain news headlines today.\nSzabo defined a contract as being \u201ca set of promises agreed to in a meeting of the minds [which] is the traditional way to formalize a relationship.\u201d Such contracts are a pillar of a free market economy and can be useful in business relationships, marriages and politics.\u00a0\nIn his 1995 article, Szabo predicted that the digital revolution would drastically change the way humans make contracts, and he questioned even then whether our traditional contracts would continue to have a use in the cyberspace era.\u00a0\nSzabo saw early on that computers were making it possible to run algorithms that used to be too costly, and believed algorithms eventually would be developed for what he termed \u201csmart contracts.\u201d He defined this as \u201ca set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on the other promises\u201d without the use of artificial intelligence.\u00a0\nSmart contracts would improve execution of the four basic contract objectives, which Szabo described as observability, verifiability, privity and enforceability. Among other use cases discussed in the following sections, smart contracts according to Szabo would enable both parties to observe the other\u2019s performance of the contract, verify if and when a contract has been performed, guarantee that only the details necessary for completion of the contract are revealed to both parties and be self-enforcing to eliminate the time spent policing the contract.\u00a0\nMultinational Small Business\nIn the 1995 marketplace, multinational businesses, rather than local ones, conducted the majority of international commerce. Szabo predicted that in a future marketplace there would be such a thing as a small and multinational business, similar in size to a local business in 1995. He believed the change could happen as quickly as the telecom boom.\u00a0\nFor local businesses in 1995, communication and transport costs had become extremely low with the advent of technological innovations such as fiber optic cables. Still, legal issues created a barrier for local businesses who wanted to enter the global playing field. Szabo predicted in his article that smart contracts would overcome that barrier, drastically lowering legal costs along with the requirement of compliance with every local legal code and regulation.\nVirtual Personas\nSzabo also suggested that people might create different virtual personas to cater to different parts of one\u2019s personality or lifestyle. One might have a persona for work life, for family life, for friends and many more. Each persona could be unique and only share data that the person felt comfortable sharing in that part of his or her life.\u00a0\nSzabo defined a \u201cnym\u201d as \u201can identifier that links only a small amount of related information about a person, usually that information deemed by the nym holder to be relevant to a particular organization or community.\u201d Nyms can include nicknames, brand names or aliases. A nym can have built-in equity from the positive associations of other nyms with a similar name or from a reputable person or group of people.\u00a0\nSzabo defined a true name as \u201can identifier that links many different kinds of information about a person, such as their birth name or Social Security number.\u201d Szabo predicted that knowing the true name of someone could provide massive economic value to a person(s); one example he cited was allowing an organization to send targeted product information, knowing the person is interested.\nA goal for everyone in the virtual world would be to create a \u201creputable name,\u201d which would be a nym or a true name that carries positive attributes and is highly regarded. Szabo predicted that one day people would sell virtual personas, similar to the way that companies sell brand names.\u00a0\nSmart Property\nWith an increase in the use of smart contracts, Szabo believed we would begin to embed smart contracts into our physical property, which he described as \u201csmart property.\u201d These embedded smart contracts would automatically grant access to the rightful owner of the property or guests, depending on the parameters of the contract.\u00a0\nSzabo provided the example of a leased car, whose embedded contract could automatically return control of the car to the loaner if the lessee failed to make payments on time. In this way, smart property would provide value only to the real owner, and could eliminate the possibility of theft.\u00a0\nVisual Smart Contract Representation\nWith smart contracts, communicating the exact terms of an agreement with all parties involved is necessary. Fine print or misrepresented information is a huge problem with traditional contracts, whereas smart contracts can have \u201cfine print\u201d written into the code that is hidden from one of several of the parties in a transaction. For example, a POS system at a grocery store, a basic version of a smart contract, can collect data about the customer, such as their name, and store it in a database without the customer knowing.\u00a0\nSzabo\u2019s solution for mainstream useability was that smart contracts should integrate a visual representation for the elements of a transaction. This would allow parties to not rely exclusively on looking at code to agree on the semantics of a contract and would eliminate any risk of hidden actions present in the code.\nSzabo\u2019s vision as articulated in 1995--the equivalent of light years ago in digital time--was remarkably accurate and has established a template that, while many at the time may have doubted, no one can now deny is becoming a reality.", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 26}

The announcement was accompanied by a signing ceremony at the Georgian Ministry of Justice.\n\u201cBy building a blockchain-based property registry and taking full advantage of the security provided by the blockchain technology, the Republic of Georgia can show the world that we are a modern, transparent and corruption-free country that can lead the world in changing the way land titling is done and pave the way to additional prosperity for all,\u201d said Papuna Ugrekhelidze, Chairman of the National Agency of Public Registry of Georgia.\nCurrently, buying or selling land in Georgia requires physically going to a public registry, which could take as long as one full day and cost between $50 and $200, depending on how quickly the parties want the transaction to be notarized. The pilot project will move elements of this process onto the blockchain and cost buyers and sellers in the range of 5 to 10 cents.\nBitFury, based in San Francisco, is a Bitcoin company that, so far, has been known mainly for mining. In January, Bitcoin Magazine reported that the company, the third-largest mining operation by total hashrate, will be mass-producing its custom 16nm ASIC chip and selling the chip directly to consumers. It appears, however, that BitFury intends to diversify.\nThe current version of the BitFury website describes the company as a full-service blockchain technology company that uses the technology of the public blockchain to allow companies to successfully digitize their assets and safely transact them over the Internet \u2012 making the world safer, simpler and more efficient. The project seems a significant step in that direction.\n\u201cWe are launching the property rights registration project for Georgian citizens so that they can register property on the blockchain,\u201d said Valery Vavilov, founder and CEO of BitFury. He added that using the blockchain will add security to the data, permit much faster operations and simplify the process while lowering its costs.\n\"We are thrilled to be leading the game-changing effort in Blockchain land titling,\u201d Vavilov told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThe Blockchain is a transformational technology that will completely change how we view trade, ownership, identity and trust. If we can successfully chart the path ahead in this space so people can record, secure and transfer their property on the blockchain, we can help millions of people around the word have access to capital and the advanced economic opportunity. \u00a0We thank the innovative and forward-thinking Georgian government and renowned economist Hernando de Soto for their leadership and partnership in making this effort a reality.\u201d\nDe Soto, known for his work on the informal economy and on the importance of business and property rights, is president of the Institute for Liberty and Democracy (ILD) in Lima, Peru. The Institute\u2019s projects with developing countries include managing property formalization in Peru, implementing land titling in El Salvador and helping streamline the legal frameworks governing property and business rights in Tanzania and Egypt.\n\u201cOf the 7.3 billion people in the world, only two billion have a title that is legal and effective and public regarding their control over an asset,\u201d said De Soto. \u201cWhen something is not legally on record as being owned, it can therefore not be used \u2026 as collateral to get credit, as a credential that you can be able to transfer part of your property to invite investment in. Things are owned, but when they\u2019re not adequately paperized or recorded, they cannot fill the functions of creating capital and credit.\u201d\nAccording to Vavilov, the blockchain will be used as a notary service. In November, Bitcoin Magazine covered the plans of the Estonian government for another official blockchain-based notarization service. Estonia partnered with blockchain-based \u201cGovernance 2.0\u201d initiative Bitnation to offer a public notary service to Estonian e-residents based on blockchain technology.\u00a0\n\u201cVia the international Bitnation Public Notary, e-residents, regardless of where they live or do business, will be able to notarize their marriages, birth certificates, business contracts and much more on the blockchain,\u201d stated a joint press release.\nIn 2015, Bitnation also developed and tested workable DIY land titles recorded on the blockchain in Ghana, where 70 percent of land lacks proper title, preventing investment and borrowing in real property markets. Bitnation\u2019s land titles initiative in Ghana wasn\u2019t controlled by the government, but P2P-managed at the grassroots level.\nBitcoin Magazine contacted Bitnation Founder and CEO Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof for comments on the initiative of the Republic of Georgia.\u00a0\n\u201cThe risk with doing land titles on the blockchain is that it might be used by a central entity, like a government, as a justification for state coercion, in the same way democracy, the social contract, and the constitution are used to justify the nation-state oligopoly on governance,\u201d said Tarkowski Tempelhof. \u201cIt might also be used to seize land. The fact that the blockchain makes it more transparent and secure doesn't remove the fact that the entries into the land registry are still managed by a small group of coercive actors with their own special interests.\"\nPhoto\u00a0Nino Ozbetelashvili\u00a0/ Creative Commons", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 27}

Advancements in information-sharing technology, including data analytics, cloud computing, wireless sensors, smart contracts, decentralized autonomous organizations and blockchain technology seem to be fuelling not just a disruption but a revolution, fuelled by the invention of Bitcoin and blockchain tech.\nAccording to a recent\u00a0report, almost 90 percent of 800 experts\u00a0surveyed by the World Economic Forum (WEF) believe that the Internet of Things (IoT) will reach a tipping point of 1 trillion connected devices in a decade. Moreover, 58 percent of the experts believe that 10 percent of global gross domestic product will be stored on blockchain technology by 2025.\nFrom smart young men and women in their basement garages to pioneering giants such as Intel, a race is underway to make possible what seems futuristic: traffic managing itself, lights operating on their own, cars communicating with each other, charging stations buying products from manufacturers, refrigerators ordering your dinner \u2012 and that\u2019s only the low-hanging fruit.\nThe first industrial revolution followed the invention of steam power in 1784; mass production sparked the second revolution of the 1870s; and the invention of electronic and IT systems in the 1970s led to the third revolution. The fourth revolution showing signs of being well underway could be identified as that of the \u201ccyber-physical systems.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Rise of the Intelligent Machines\nWhat has slowly been building for two decades has started to gain steam due to the invention of digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Sometimes referred to as programmable money, these currencies and systems allow machines to have their own Bitcoin addresses, which function much like bank accounts due to Bitcoin\u2019s permissionless nature. In combination with other technologies, \u201cbank account power\u201d gives machines, in effect, a level of intelligence that allows them to manage and allocate funds according to stated rules.\u00a0\nA new study describes a business model for these machines, one currently practiced by a handful of startups such as Slock.it. In describing the need for intelligent machines to have access to data, and the issues that arise when they encounter difficulties due to centralized providers\u2019 account requirements, the study suggests a solution in the creation of \u00a0decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). To fund DAO creation, a token is issued and then freely traded, with its value reflecting the productivity of the DAO. In this way the machine can access the data directly and pay for it digitally.\nIn its foundation, the DAO is simply code. But this code allows it to speak by sending or receiving information, act by making payments, and even think \u2013 albeit what we have told it to think \u2013 by analyzing data and making decisions, according to the rules, on the amount that is to be invested and the nature of such investment.\nBillions Are Pouring In\nAccording to a May 2015 report by CNN Money, a small number of well-capitalized Silicon Valley companies were a year ago sitting on hundreds of billions\u00a0of dollars due to the uncertainties of the recent recession. However, as new opportunities arise, they are now apparently starting to invest more as they position themselves for what a Cisco\u00a0report estimated in 2013 to be an almost $15 trillion IoT market in the next decade.\nFintech, a subset of IoT and itself an umbrella term for technology-empowered financial innovation with blockchain tech a front-seat driver, experienced more than 60 percent growth in the first quarter of this year with global investment rising to $5.3 billion.\nThe sleeping giants are once again moving. Intel quietly went to China and, signalling a shift in pace, asked their manufacturers to focus on IoT products. HP announced a new partnership to study \u201cintelligent transportation.\u201d IBM opened a completely new IoT research center in combination with the University of South Carolina. Meanwhile, Microsoft is keen to introduce developers to Azure IoT, with some taking advantage of the opportunity to ensure their beer is cool and refreshing.\nWhile many components are needed to build this new future, permissionless, programmable money is the energizing fuel. For the first time, digital currencies allow machines to exchange value, trade, negotiate, buy and sell. Previously, giant centralized institutions acted as gatekeepers, requiring permission for access to their infrastructures, thus making it difficult, if even possible, for machines to hold money. Bitcoin has helped change that.\nOne of the genius aspects of Bitcoin is that it turns money into pure and free information, thus transforming physical cash and gold into the natural habitat of machines which are experts at managing, storing, manipulating and communicating information.\nHowever, like the laying of the railroads or the Internet cables, we are still at the infrastructure-building stage. Some suggest that advancements in technology are now becoming exponential, and, according to the WEF study, will hit a tipping point in the next 10 years, transforming the world in the process and giving rise to a full-blown revolution of intelligent machines.\nSources:\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/developer-s-introduction-to-azure-iot/\nhttp://www.valuewalk.com/2016/04/intel-chinese-firms-develop-iot-products/\nhttp://www.telecompaper.com/news/ibm-university-of-south-carolina-open-iot-research-centre--1138755\nhttp://www.digitimes.com/news/a20160319PD201.html\nhttp://gunnarpeipman.com/2016/02/beer-iot-building-universal-windows-application-to-monitor-cooling-process/\nhttp://uk.businessinsider.com/accenture-report-investors-backed-fintech-with-56-billion-2016-4\nhttp://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac79/docs/innov/IoE_Economy.pdf\nhttp://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12083-016-0456-1#page-1", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 25}

The company intends to leverage blockchain technology to address the trade-off between patient centric care and operational efficiency by creating a healthcare ecosystem connected to universal data infrastructure. \u201cShared infrastructure allows us to create global data standards without compromising privacy and security,\u201d notes the new Gem Health website.\nThe Gem Health blockchain network includes identity schemes, data storage, and smart contracts applications that execute against shared data infrastructure. Using the Gem Health network, different healthcare operators can access the same information, which will permit the development of a new class of blockchain-based applications that will unlock wasted resources and solve important operational problems in healthcare.\nClosed book-keeping and medical record repositories prevent effective interoperability and collaboration between different healthcare providers, which is an important issue for people who relocate or become sick when they travel and are unable to connect with their local doctor to retrieve their medical records. It\u2019s also important to note that new medical research is introduced every year, which makes it difficult for individual physicians and healthcare providers to keep up with medical innovation.\n\u201cA lot of healthcare companies started reaching out to us,\u201d \u00a0Gem Founder and CEO Micah Winkelspecht told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cA lot of companies were suffering from these same pain points - working with siloed data that we could bridge together. Use cases of distributed ledger technology span the entire healthcare continuum, a whole range of processes from wellness and prevention to billing and claims. We need a patient centric model for healthcare and particularly how to secure clinical data.\u201d\n\u201cOne of the most interesting groups that reached out to us when we started talking about the blockchain and healthcare were physicians themselves,\u201d added Winkelspecht. \u201cMany of them see the problems with today\u2019s technology and are fed up with the current system. Physicians want to help. And so we want to create platform for all the different stakeholders to collaborate.\u201d\nIn a recent article published in Distributed, Winkelspecht argued that it is now possible, using blockchain-enabled data sharing with guaranteed data integrity, to build a global repository of data within the healthcare and other industries, which each party can trust reliably. \u201cGone are the silos and separate, differing views of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery company now has the same data, shared transparently\u201d. In particular, blockchains will permit creating a robust and resilient healthcare ecosystem with industry-wide workflows involving data moving around among multiple parties.\nWinkelspecht is bullish about the potential of Ethereum to provide a suitable, evolving technology framework for Gem Health. \u201cWe chose to develop this network on the Ethereum blockchain because we\u2019re driven by customer need and look for platforms that satisfy those needs,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause Ethereum is trying to build a global computer for general use, it is good platform for diverse use cases. It doesn\u2019t make a lot of strong assumptions and it has a really great community building lots of different tools.\u201c\nGem, which recently raised $7.1 million in Series A funding round, is betting that blockchain networks will underpin entire industries, transforming how we collaborate and share value. The early focus on payments and financial applications is, according to the company, a limitation to overcome. \u201cWe found that a lot of the discussion around blockchain was so focused on the financial industry and we felt that that was a limiting view of the blockchain,\u201d said Winkelspecht. \u201cWe decided to start creating some content around non-financial use cases of the blockchain and found that there was a lot of interest beyond just the financial sector.\u201d\nEarly support by a major operator like Philips Healthcare, which employs 37,000 employees in 100 countries and makes up 42 percent of the global sales revenue of the Royal Philips group, is a positive signal for\u00a0Gem Health\u2019s adoption in the wider healthcare sector.\n\u201cLike the financial industry, it\u2019s going to start with small groups working together on proof of concepts and pilot projects to tackle specific use cases,\u201d concluded Winkelspecht. \u201cOut of those use cases, we\u2019ll develop a common fabric for the entire industry. A blockchain to run the entire healthcare continuum: the free and instant transfer of healthcare data.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 26}

Participants on the panel were Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra, Blockstream Core Tech Engineer Mark Friedenbach, Lightning Network co-creator Joseph Poon and Bitcoin Core contributor Jonas Schnelli.\nDuring the Q&A; portion of the panel, an audience member asked the participants to share their opinions on the previous presentation, in which the World Bitcoin Network\u2019s James D\u2019Angelo posited the idea of replacing Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work with elected individuals who would be trusted with mining blocks. The panel seemed generally bearish on D\u2019Angelo\u2019s proposal. Generally, the panel disagreed with the idea of turning Bitcoin into a democratically controlled currency.\nBitcoin Is Not a Democracy\nFriedenbach was the first to respond to the audience member\u2019s question, and he made a point of directly taking on the idea of Bitcoin as a democratically controlled currency. He noted:\n\n\u201cBitcoin is not a democracy. It was never designed to be a democracy. Democracy is antithetical to what Bitcoin represents, which is consensus even in the face of mob-rule voting the other way.\u201d\n\nThe idea that changes to Bitcoin should be governed democratically has been popularized by some supporters of Bitcoin Classic. Most notably, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has referred to hard forks as elections.\nBitcoin Runs on Consensus\nFriedenbach went on to explain that any change to the consensus algorithm in Bitcoin that does not have universal support from nodes will result in a fork. He added, \u201cThat is as user-protecting as it is scary when things break.\u201d\nIn Friedenbach\u2019s view, the difficulties associated with making changes to Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules are what make the system valuable in the first place. He stated:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the source of everything that makes Bitcoin great in terms of irrevocability of payments and the fact that you can't have your funds seized. This is all because it is really difficult and very hard to change the Bitcoin protocol.\u201d\n\nWhile systems that do not require consensus can evolve faster, it\u2019s also more likely for the wrong changes to be made when near-universal agreement on those alterations is not required. With a system based on consensus, Bitcoin holders can be assured that a bitcoin today will still be a bitcoin tomorrow. Although this makes it harder for Bitcoin to upgrade at the base level, innovation can still take place at layers above the Bitcoin blockchain.\nAdvocates of Bitcoin\u2019s use as digital gold tend to agree with the near-universal consensus requirement of Bitcoin development, while individuals focused on the P2P payments aspect of the system, such as Bitcoin Classic developer Gavin Andresen, would like to see the protocol evolve more quickly -- without the need for approval by nearly everyone on the network.\nPolitical Money Already Exists\nFriedenbach also agreed with remarks made by Bitcoin Core contributor Cory Fields in terms of the healthy contentiousness found in the community. In regard to the block size debate, he stated, \u201cIf this was political money, 18 months ago this would have been over.\u201d\nPoelstra agreed with Friedenbach\u2019s comments on Bitcoin as apolitical money. He stated:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a solution to replace Bitcoin with a political currency. There are lots of political currencies out there today. If you think that\u2019s a solution, you\u2019re welcome to switch to a political currency. Changing Bitcoin to be another one -- however you could do that -- I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a solution. That\u2019s just shutting down Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nA transcript of the full panel discussion is available online thanks to Bryan Bishop.\nUpdated at 11:24 am EST on 5/28/2016 to add a link to the panel transcript.", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 27}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nAlthough Bitcoin is more than 7 years old, making payments on the network is still a rather cumbersome task. With a user interface that requires users to send money to long strings of letters and numbers rather than human-readable names, it\u2019s no wonder that many individuals have a hard time figuring out how to use this new financial technology.\nBIP 70 (Payment Protocol), which was authored by Bitcoin Foundation Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen and former Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn, has been a step in the right direction, but the relatively new BIP 75, which was co-authored by developers from Netki (Justin Newton and Matt David) and Breadwallet (Aaron Voisine and James MacWhyte), takes the main ideas in BIP 70 one step further.\nWhat is the Payment Protocol?\nThe Payment Protocol creates a method of communication between a merchant and their customers before a payment is made. This communication protocol allows customers to see human-readable payment destinations, which can be authenticated via digital signatures. The protocol also creates a proof-of-payment for the customer, and it automatically provides a refund address to the merchant from the customer\u2019s wallet.\nThis version of the Payment Protocol has been helpful in creating a checkout process for merchants that is similar to other options on traditional point-of-sale systems.\nHow Does BIP 75 Improve Upon the Payment Protocol?\nOne of the main downfalls of BIP 70 is that it doesn\u2019t work well for P2P payments. While it gets the job done for transactions between a customer and a merchant, Bitcoin wallets are unable to receive payment requests when they\u2019re offline. Store-and-forward servers can be used to forward new payment requests to wallets when they come online, but this setup creates new privacy and security concerns. BIP 75 is an attempt to solve this issue by encrypting all communication in the Payment Protocol end to end.\n\u201cBy adding encryption at the application layer we create secure private communications, even in the case where there is a store and forward server for mobile or desktop wallets,\u201d Netki founder and CEO Justin Newton, who co-authored BIP 75, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThis additional encryption also protects the users in the case that the transport layer security is compromised.\u201d\nBIP 75 also allows the sender of a payment to create a cryptographically-signed invoice request for the receiver. This enables the receiver to validate the identity of the sender before they release an address in the returned payment request. Then, the receiver sends the encrypted payment request back to the sender.\nNetki Senior Software Engineer and BIP 75 co-author Matt David clarified the differences in digital signature usage between BIP 70 and BIP 75 for Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n\u201cA digital signature exists only in the Payment Request message portion of the BIP 70 process, and therefore, the signature is only from the receiver. In BIP 75, there are digital signatures from both parties (via certificate signatures) as well as message signatures from each side to prove ownership of the messaging keys, which are used to calculate the encryption key for the Payment Protocol transaction.\u201d\n\nThe human-readable names used in this updated version of the Payment Protocol make the entire payment process much more user-friendly. Personal logs of transactions are also improved because the names of people from past transactions are stored in a log rather than just a list of random Bitcoin addresses.\nWallet Names\nThe Wallet Names discussed in BIP 75 would allow users to store static domain-style names, such as kyle.bitcoinmagazine.com. This enables what essentially amounts to address books in Bitcoin wallets. Wallet names can be mapped to BIP 32 wallets, which means users can use a single address for all payments without compromising on privacy. A new Bitcoin address is generated for each payment to avoid address reuse.\nIn terms of how Wallet Names are mapped to Bitcoin addresses in this system, Newton told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n\u201cWallet Names can point to a web address where the sending wallet can retrieve a unique address per transaction via a BIP 21 formatted response, or can initiate a BIP 75 Payment Protocol transaction, resulting in a signed Payment Request (including a unique address) generated by the receiving wallet.\u201d\n\nWith this BIP implemented, Bitcoin wallets will look less like the early days of the Internet and more like modern payment applications such as Venmo.\nThanks\u00a0to Netki Senior Software Engineer and BIP 75 co-author Matt David and Netki COO\u00a0Dawn Newton\u00a0for reviewing this article for technical accuracy.\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

In the fall of 2015, BitPay and BTC Media (parent company of Bitcoin Magazine) commissioned Josh Dykgraaf, an artist based in Amsterdam who specializes in 3D and photo illustrations, to design an infograph as a guide to navigating the emerging Bitcoin and blockchain ecosystem. The infographic has been so popular, and the growth in the ecosystem so dynamic, that BTC Media commissioned Dykgraaf to create an updated poster which made its debut in March at SXSW\u00ae, and is available as a digital download (JPEG, PDF)\u00a0or printed copy.\nOn January 3, 2009, the Genesis block, or the first block in the Bitcoin blockchain, was created. In the coinbase parameter, there was a simple message: \u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\u201d From that one block, Bitcoin was born.\u00a0\nBitcoin has come a long way from that initial statement by Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. The technology is growing up and changing, from its early days as a project adopted by impassioned technologists and libertarians to a technology widely researched and used by financial institutions worldwide.\u00a0\nBitcoin had a rough road ahead of it, as did many early technologies, including the Internet. It dealt with newspaper headlines lambasting Bitcoin because of its connection to Silk Road and drugs. Early adopters suffered millions of dollars in losses when early exchange Mt. Gox imploded. \u201cBitcoin is Dead,\u201d many prophesied.\u00a0\n\nAnd yet, as Bitcoin approaches its eighth birthday, we see things changing. It is turning into that curious, wide-eyed technology with ideas as widespread as any normal eight-year-old. Cross-border payments, machine-to-machine transactions, smart contracts, microtransactions and stock settlements all have been discussed and developed. Nothing is off limits; no question goes unasked.\u00a0\nFrom the early days of mining using a laptop computer, now Bitcoin miners have industrial-sized data centers with hundreds of thousands of high-powered, specialized machines. In January 2014, the Bitcoin network hashrate was only 10 million GH/s. Today, it is more than 1 billion GH/s and growing quickly as new mining machines are built and sold. Around January 2014, there were around 50,000 Bitcoin transactions daily. That measure of network utility has increased to more than 200,000 Bitcoin transactions daily.\nA big part of this growth in transactions is linked to the growth in Bitcoin-accepting merchants. In mid-2014, there were approximately 65,000 merchants who accepted Bitcoin. Now, there are more than 100,000, which represents a 50 percent increase. TigerDirect, a publicly traded online electronics retailer, has seen incredible results. Of all the buyers that used Bitcoin, 46 percent of them were brand new to TigerDirect. Further, orders placed with Bitcoin were 30 percent larger.\u00a0\nBitPay, a Bitcoin payment processor, also has seen a significant increase in volume. It announced in a blog post written at the beginning of 2016 that it has experienced a transactional increase of 50 percent in the last two months and an increase of 110 percent in the past 12 months. BitPay also saw record-breaking months for Bitcoin transactions in November and December of 2015, with more than 100,000 BitPay invoices processed each month. BitPay explains in the post, \u201cAt these rates, every 25 seconds a shopper somewhere in the world was spending Bitcoin at a BitPay merchant.\u201d In Latin America, total transactions were up 1,747 percent in 2015. \u00a0Bitcoin as a tool of transaction is growing.\u00a0\nBitcoin as an asset class is also maturing. For the majority of 2015, the price stayed relatively nonvolatile and constant, fluctuating between $200 and $300. It was only toward the end of 2015 that the price experienced a significant increase, reminiscent of the early years, to finish the year as the world\u2019s top performing currency (down from -67 percent in 2014 to +35 percent in 2015). From January 1, 2013 to January 1, 2014, the price went from $13.41 to $808.05, going as high as $1,147.25 on December 4. Just one month earlier, on November 4, 2013, the price was $225.20. Even the \u201cbubbles\u201d in Bitcoin are maturing. On the other hand, the market cap of Bitcoin is down from an all-time high of nearly $14 billion to around $6.5 billion at the time of writing.\u00a0\nVenture capital funding continues to pour into the space. In 2013, Bitcoin companies raised only $93.8 million. In 2014, firms raised $314.7 million. In 2015, Bitcoin and blockchain companies raised more than $1 billion.\nRegulations are also changing. Before, there were politicians decrying Bitcoin because of its use on the underground marketplace Silk Road. Now, organizations such as Coin Center and the Chamber of Digital Commerce work to help these politicians and regulators draft rules that will ensure Bitcoin can continue to grow worldwide. New York has led the regulatory charge with its recent BitLicense initiative. The European Union also recently ruled that Bitcoin was not subject to VAT, providing significant clarity for those participating in the ecosystem.\u00a0\nFinally, the development of blockchain companies and enterprise solutions continues to grow. In 2015, Bitcoin and blockchain enterprise development generated over $1 billion in capital investments, with the first quarter of the year surpassing the total amount of funding for the entire previous 12 months. To date, more than 65 banks and financial institutions have made investments in the industry, and businesses in diverse fields ranging from health care to insurance to global supply chain trade networks have entered the arena.\nThe year 2016 has seen Augur, a decentralized prediction market, announce that it had raised $5.1 million in a crowdsale. Ethereum, the smart contract and publishing platform, raised $18.4 million in its own crowdsale. It is expected that OpenBazaar, the completely decentralized peer-to-peer ecommerce site, will launch in the coming months. Blockchain technology is rapidly ushering in a new world of data integrity that will impact industry and commerce on a magnitude comparable to the dawning of the Internet.\nBitcoin is not just on the fringes anymore; it is becoming mainstream. Whether it's miners, payment processors, wallets, developer tools, large-enterprise blockchain solutions or innovative new fintech accelerators, the reality is simple. Bitcoin and its blockchain are growing up. And the future they are opening to the world is as vast as that unlocked by any of the greatest technologies in history.", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 27}

From distributed interoperable health records to proof of adherence for medication, the healthcare industry is ripe for digital innovation. More generally, technology is a hyper-deflationary force, and this could be particularly effective in delivering quality health care through more effective channels such as mobile apps.\nInvestments in the digital health space have increased significantly in the past two years. This is largely possible because of improved low-power sensors and user-friendly cloud platforms that interface with those hardware devices. The Rock Health Funding Database shows a $4.5 billion increase in venture funding in digital health from 2014 to 2015.\nSmart contract technology is built on top of virtual currencies such as Bitcoin and is a hallmark of \"Bitcoin 2.0\" platforms. Blockchain is the fundamental infrastructure needed for Bitcoin transactions to work, and an enabling technology for the next generation of asset-based platforms.\nA smart contract is simply a piece of code that is stored on the blockchain. It can be triggered by particular blockchain transactions and, in return, read or write data to that blockchain. The rise of smart contracts can be understood in the framework described by Carlota Perez in her excellent book, Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital: The Dynamics of Bubbles and Golden Ages.\nEssentially, most technological revolutions have two phases: the first where the groundwork is done, called the installation phase, and the next, focused on innovating and building on the groundwork, called the deployment phase. For example, in the installation phase of the Internet revolution, most companies built the core infrastructure to make the Internet available to the general public. In the deployment phase, companies started building applications on top of the infrastructure such as social media services. Blockchain development is in the installation phase and smart contracts will be part of the deployment of its infrastructure.\nThere are four major areas where the blockchain and smart contracts can become deeply integrated into digital health.\nSmart Property Management: Tracking Medication\nBlockchain can bring the same level of trust and accountability to supply chains as it does with currency or financial assets. The decentralized management of a pharmaceutical supply chain through tamper-evident technology can be really beneficial in tracking counterfeit drugs. This use case is a supply chain issue that was brought up by Primrose Mbanefo from Accenture in a working group meeting of the Hyperledger Project.\nMbanefo pointed out that consumers want reassurance for the fact that the drugs they take actually contain the active ingredient and in the appropriate proportions as advertised. According to Mbanefo, the counterfeiters are failing to include the right amounts of active ingredients in medicines and this issue can be addressed by making the supply chain more transparent. The blockchain could provide proof of origin to verify that a particular shipment of drugs actually came from a specified factory or manufacturer.\nIBM also is working on the issue of supply chain transparency through privately deployed blockchains for an enterprise. With the addition of Watson, supply chains can be managed as a smart property that self-reports, proving the authenticity of a drug at every stage of its manufacture, delivery and eventual consumption.\nPublic Health Banks\nFor a patient visiting the hospital, there are accurate records on the symptoms and conditions, tests ordered, treatments offered and the outcome. In the near future, records on patient treatment plans could be released (upon consent) anonymously into public health banks, which are decentralized networks where information is managed and coordinated through a blockchain.\nThen, public health institutions can form smart contracts with these health banks to broadcast alerts or potential threats to partner hospitals or healthcare providers. For such a health bank, accessing information would be cheap or free, but posting or broadcasting to all nodes would cost significantly more. In this manner, the network can sustain itself through revenue from its partners. From the patient side, this process is not much different from checking a box to \"send anonymous usage data\" that we often do in apps today. The data available from such a health bank can provide population statistics and trends that may not be visible from a \u201cmicro-scale\u201d view of individual patients.\nAside from the data, the blockchain can facilitate an electronic health record (EHR) system that can manage access to data between multiple parties at the scale of a health bank. Currently the Precision Medicine Initiative is building the technology core and infrastructure that would power the collection and storage of biological data (such as conditions and treatments) of more than a million volunteers.\nUniversal EMRs: Health XML\nCurrently, all medical records associated with patients are stored in closed databases called practice management suites. Most hospitals and private clinics use different vendors for their practice management suites and most of them maintain that data in silos. Recently, there has been more of a push to move this data into the cloud in a format called Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The hope is that the use of EHRs will standardize the storage of patient data and allow for better interoperability between different healthcare organizations.\nThis process will also make it frictionless for patients to access their own medical data \u2013 like sharing a collection of photos via Google Photos. The administrator simply selects the data objects that the patient requested and generates a link to share them. This unique link will be sent to the patient, and he or she can open it up to view all the data released by the hospital.\nThe blockchain can be used to manage the distribution of those encrypted datalinks per patient based on addresses. The infrastructure for storage (the blocks) can be constructed in such a manner that each block corresponds to a specific type of data, for instance, tagging a block with metadata to separate a block storing links for scans from another block storing the links for medication. Then the front-end wallet could retrieve these blocks and use the metadata as a health-XML language to put them together in a patient profile. Simple transactions can be used to verify the patient and unlock each block, putting together that profile for a patient in a secure manner.\nOnce the data is in the cloud, a variety of computations can be performed on it. In the future, doctors can prescribe the use of devices like Fitbit for improving personal health. Smart contracts can be implemented on personal fitness data and act as a rewards program for improving health per visit to the doctor.\nProof-of-Adherence\nRecent studies in mobile health on management of chronic conditions and medication through apps has brought attention to smartphone-enabled medication adherence programs. The goal of these programs is to provide a self-management framework for patients that leads them to just the right level of medication based on their physiological data. These programs are turning out to be effective; if patients don\u2019t experience severe side effects, they show high-levels of adherence toward their medication [1].\nMost of these programs are either powered by text messages or using simple server-client mobile apps. As the patients go through those programs, a tremendous amount of data is automatically recorded on patient behavior. This data is further analyzed to develop best practices and patterns.\nAn extension to the health-XML idea mentioned above can be used to run these clinical trials on a small portion of the population. The patients can be divided into cohorts based on their physiology and the data can then be reported on the blockchain. Some of the labor intensive processes can be replaced or partially automated based on recommendations made by intelligent agents who are reading a blockchain and establishing an average baseline for each cohort.\nThese intelligent agents would be available on-demand and work for a limited period of time on a subscription basis. The subscription would be powered by a deposit made by the administrator monitoring the cohorts. This bot-economy will use the blockchain as the infrastructure that the intelligent bots can consume. The more sophisticated bots will be \"hired\" more often and, in this manner, companies can design bots adaptively to provide recommendations to the administrator as the data changes.\nBlockchain-based technologies will become the foundation for digital innovation that can reach millions of lives. A unique combination of artificial intelligence, smart contracts and the blockchain will become the nervous system of our society, helping us live longer and healthier lives.\nReferences\n[1] McGillicuddy, J.W., Gregoski, M.J., Weiland, A.K., Rock, R.A., Brunner-Jackson, B.M., Patel, S.K., Thomas, B.S., Taber, D.J., Chavin, K.D., Baliga, P.K. and Treiber, F.A., 2013.

How Bitcoin\u2019s Security Processes Became a Model for the Open Source Community", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/what-is-gitian-building-how-bitcoin-s-security-processes-became-a-model-for-the-open-source-community-1461862937/", "birthday": "Apr 28, 2016  1:02 PM EST", "date": "2016-04-28 18:02:00", "content": "Aaron van Wirdum is interested in decentralized consensus, FOSS, privacy in the digital age, censorship resistant payments, and more of that stereotypical Bitcoin stuff. Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nOne of Bitcoin's most important security features, a crucial property that makes the system trustless, is its open source nature. Because Bitcoin\u2019s code is open source, anyone able to read code can check for themselves whether it does what it's supposed to do.\u00a0\nPlus, as per\u00a0Linus's Law: Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.\nBut open source code doesn't necessarily eliminate all risk. Users still need to trust that the software they run on their computers actually reflects the open source code as it should. To eliminate this risk, Bitcoin developers have developed a fierce security policy which goes beyond the open source nature of Bitcoin itself: \u201cGitian Building.\u201d\nGitian Building is even increasingly embraced by the wider open source community. Development teams behind Tor, Debian, Mozilla and other open source projects are embracing the practice spearheaded by the Bitcoin Core development team, and it might very well become an open source standard before long.\nHere's why Gitian Building is important, and how it works.\nOn Source Code and Binaries\nThe problem that Gitian Building solves, at its heart, is that humans and computers do not speak the same language.\nBitcoin Core is written in C++, one of several programming languages. Programming languages \u2013 while obviously very different from actual languages \u2013 can be written and read by humans. And it's this C++ code that's open source, and therefore checkable and verifiable.\nBut computer CPUs cannot actually read these programming languages. Instead, CPUs have their own \u201cmachine language\u201d: binaries. Binaries, as the name suggests, are often represented as \u201cones\u201d and \u201czeros.\u201d But more important: binaries are not readable by humans.\nFor a program written in human readable code (such as C++) to be executed on a computer, it must be \u201ctranslated\u201d into binaries. This \u201ctranslation\u201d process is called \u201ccompiling,\u201d and is done using special software: a compiler. Someone, somewhere needs to compile code into binaries.\nIf it weren't for Gitian Building, the compiling process would present a potential single point of failure.\nThe Risk\nSo what, exactly, the risk if there is no Gitian Building process?\nLet's say that Wladimir van der Laan, Bitcoin Core's lead developer, is tasked with compiling Bitcoin Core's code into binaries. This would mean he\u2019d have to insert C++ code in the compiler installed on his computer, and the Bitcoin Core binaries come out on the other end. He then distributes these binaries through bitcoin.org, bitcoincore.org and perhaps other platforms.\nThe problem is obvious. While anyone able to read C++ can check and verify Bitcoin Core's open source code, they still need to trust that the binaries as published by Van der Laan reflect this same code.\nBut if, for example, Van der Laan\u2019s computer is compromised, his compiler could be replaced with software that creates malicious binaries instead \u2012 perhaps binaries that look like Bitcoin Core when running on a computer, but that actually steal bitcoins. Or, Van der Laan might be coerced by someone with nefarious intentions, and is forced to publish malicious binaries. Or\u00a0perhaps Van der Laan will one day go crazy and intentionally spread malware himself.\nIt's unlikely anyone would realize any of this until it's too late; while the code is open source, no one can actually read the binaries.\nGitian Building\nThe easy way to solve this problem would be to have several developers all build binaries from the same code and cross check these binaries against each other. If their binaries are identical, they know the binaries are accurate, and none of them would be compromised. Plus, anyone else could compile the binaries, too, and check whether the developers are still acting honestly. This type of cross checking would eliminate a single point of failure.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, it's not that simple. Binary building is a very unpredictable process, involving many variables. If different developers for instance use different compilers, different operating systems, or even compile the binaries at different times, the binaries might look very different. This makes simple cross checking useless.\nTo solve this, a Bitcoin ecosystem contributor going by the pseudonym \u201cDev Random,\u201d along several Bitcoin Core contributors, created Gitian.\nGitian is an open source software program that offers what is known as a \u201cbuild environment.\u201d A build environment is perhaps best described as a \u201ccomputer within a computer,\u201d but with a specific purpose: a virtual space to compile binaries, completely free of any variables. \u201cGitian Building,\u201d the process of compiling binaries in Gitian, ensures that whatever computer is used, the binaries turn out exactly the same.\u00a0\nThis, in turn, enables different developers to reliably cross check their binaries against each other. And, of course, it allows anyone else to verify whether the binaries match the source code as well.\nFor a more in-depth explanation of Gitian Building, see this CCC-talk by The Tor Project's Mike Perry and Electronic Frontier Foundation's Seth Schoen:\nThanks to Bitcoin Core developer BtcDrak.", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 28}

According to the company, IBM has created essential new cloud services for tamper-proof, trusted blockchain networks.\n\"Clients tell us that one of the inhibitors of the adoption of blockchain is concerns about security,\" said Jerry Cuomo, vice president of Blockchain, IBM. \"While there is a sense of urgency to pioneer blockchain for business, most organizations need help to define the ideal cloud environment that enables blockchain networks to run securely in the cloud.\"\u00a0\nIBM is launching several initiatives to address the security needs of clients, startups, and developers, including cloud services with the highest Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 and Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) in the industry to support the use of blockchain technology in government, financial services and healthcare.\n\"Blockchain is a highly innovative and promising technology. However there are a lot of issues to be solved for enterprise systems,\" said Eiji Ueki, director and executive vice president of NTT DATA. \"IBM\u2019s new blockchain cloud service is directly trying to address those issues. We believe this will help accelerate the maturation of blockchain technology.\"\nIBM is offering new cloud services to help businesses quickly host secure, tamper-resistant networks and scale to thousands of users, including tamper-resistant storage of crypto keys and services to enable blockchain peers to run in protected environments to prevent leaks through shared memory or hardware. According to the company, the new cloud services achieve the ideal criteria for cloud-based blockchain networks by providing an auditable operating environment with comprehensive log data that supports forensics and compliance.\n\"When considering a cloud environment for a blockchain network or in a regulated industry, organizations must ask the right questions because not all cloud environments are equally secure,\" Cuomo told Bitcoin Magazine. \"A trusted cloud environment is critical to many industry compliance requirements. To address this, IBM is launching new blockchain services on the IBM Cloud that can help organizations in industries such as banking, healthcare and government.\u201d\nIBM is a premier member of Linux Foundation\u2019s Hyperledger Project, a collaborative effort started in December to establish, build and sustain an open, distributed ledger platform that will satisfy a variety of use cases across multiple industries. \"The Linux Foundation believes a shared infrastructure that is open to critical inspection and collaboration will be pivotal in driving global adoption of blockchain for distributed ledgers,\" Linux Foundation executive director Jim Zemlin told Bitcoin Magazine in an interview.\nIn February, Bitcoin Magazine reported that IBM is making tens of thousands of lines of code available to the Hyperledger Project to help developers easily build secure distributed ledgers that can be used to exchange most anything of value. IBM is persuaded that Hyperledger could make blockchain-based services faster, more scalable and easier to use, and expects Hyperledger software to provide special advantages for owners of IBM hardware.\nNow, IBM intends to make it easier to use IBM\u2019s code based on the Hyperledger Project in any environment, including its cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) Bluemix, and is offering Bluemix services to help developers quickly build applications. For application developers who want to get a blockchain environment running almost instantly and start building applications, the beta release of IBM\u2019s blockchain on Bluemix provides access to the very latest Linux Hyperledger code, updated as the code continues to emerge.\n\u201cBluemix Services make it easy for Factom developers to work with IBM blockchain code,\u201d said Paul Snow, chief architect of Factom. \"IBM is the single largest contributor to open source technology, and the Internet would not be what it is today without their contributions. Exploring blockchain technology with IBM is exciting, and our approaches are complementary. We are thrilled to see how they will help grow the industry.\"\nFor organizations that need the flexibility to run blockchains on different cloud servers or devices, a signed, certified distribution of IBM\u2019s code submission to the Hyperledger project is now available on Docker Hub, a cloud-based registry service for building and shipping application or service containers.

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nThe Lightning Network may well be Bitcoin\u2019s primary solution to the issue of scalability, but many skeptics believe there are unresolved issues with this layer-2 system for the blockchain. The possibility of too much centralization via so-called \u201csupernodes\u201d is one of the common criticisms of the Lightning Network, and attached to that is the fear of these new, mostly -centralized payment hubs having the capacity to censor transactions.\nBitcoin Magazine recently reached out to BitGo Engineer and Statoshi.info creator Jameson Lopp to get his thoughts on the possible privacy issues associated with the Lightning Network.\nLightning Network May Offer Better Privacy\nAlthough a loss of privacy is sometimes mentioned as a possible, negative aspect of the Lightning Network, the reality is that it may offer better privacy than the current base layer of the Bitcoin blockchain. This is mainly due to the fact that the blockchain is an open, mostly -transparent ledger that can be viewed by anyone via a block explorer.\nLopp made this point during an interview with Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n\u201cI expect that privacy will actually be better on the Lightning Network than on-chain because transactions are not broadcast to the entire network. It will be much harder to collect analytics on the Lightning Network because routing nodes only know the hop before and the hop after when routing, not the entire route.\u201d\n\nAlthough not perfect, the Lightning Network does offer the advantage of keeping information related to specific transactions away from an open, transparent ledger. Whether the Lightning Network can offer better privacy than a traditional bank account (where only the bank and the parties involved in a transaction know about it) is an unknown at this point.\nWill Nodes Be Forced to Comply with AML and KYC Laws?\nOne of the main concerns associated with a Lightning Network that has a few entities running nearly all of the nodes is that these nodes will be forced to comply with Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. To this point, Lopp responded, \u201cI understand the AML/KYC fear, but routing nodes are non-custodial.\u201d\nLopp went on to explain that BitGo has based its business around being non-custodial because it means it doesn\u2019t have to deal with all of the regulatory issues associated with holding user funds.\nThe BitGo engineer also noted that the Lightning Network could still operate in an environment where the laws are changed to fit that regulation-avoiding model. Lopp believes that, much like the Internet, users could simply go around nodes with onerous requirements for routing payments. He added, \u201cIn that [scenario], we'll still see plenty of non-compliant nodes.\u201d\nA Never-Ending Battle of Privacy vs. Surveillance\nIt\u2019s possible that the battle between privacy and surveillance will never end. Having said that, those attempting to break privacy on the Internet are usually responding to new technologies created by privacy-minded individuals and organizations.\nAt this point, it appears that an attack on the level of privacy offered by the Lightning Network would be similar to an attack on the Tor network. Lopp told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cI imagine that they would need to be a well-funded attacker in order to be able to watch a significant portion of traffic.\u201d\nBlockstream\u2019s Rusty Russell and Lightning\u2019s Olaoluwa Osuntokun have been working on bringing onion routing to the Lightning Network, and it\u2019s clear that privacy is given the utmost respect by the developers working on this project.\n\u201cI foresee a Tor-style arms race in the future on two fronts,\u201d Russell told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cOne will be the battle against analytics (such as timing attacks) and bugs. The other will be against centralization, which as Bitcoin is learning, is a hard problem that, which is mainly met by (1) making it easy to decentralize, and (2) making sure people are aware of the danger.\u201d\nThere are always tradeoffs between privacy and usability. Zcash appears to be the most privacy-conscious blockchain today, but there are a few issues with the system when it comes to efficiency. Open Transactions could also be used to implement truly anonymous digital cash, but the federated server model in that system is not as secure as a blockchain (or even the Lightning Network) when it comes to control over one\u2019s funds.", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 29}

The market is estimated to be worth $15 trillion by 2025 according to a Cisco \u00a0report published in 2013.\u00a0\nThe details are not yet fully established, but the aim is to adapt and develop existing blockchain technology to the needs of Chinese businesses and set standards across the industry to ensure regulatory compliance in an environment where regulators are very positive, open and interested in blockchain technology. \u00a0\u00a0\nIt is China\u2019s answer to the rapidly moving blockchain scene, using a structure comparable to the Linux Foundation with an open source model intended to grow China\u2019s blockchain development community and willing to co-operate with any local or global organization.\nWanxiang Blockchain Labs was instrumental in bringing attention to the opportunities that blockchain technology now offers to China as Chinese organizations have expressed huge interest since the Shanghai Global Blockchain Summit in late 2015.\nBlockchain technology \u201cis just starting to explode\u201d in China, Zhao Kui, CEO of Linguo Education, which is planning on exploring blockchain technology, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cHot money is going in\u201d \u00a0Eric Zhao, from the Chinese Academy of Sciences who closely follows blockchain related developments, told Bitcoin Magazine.\nWhile almost all western global banks are exploring blockchain technology, announcing numerous hackathons and research labs, comparable announcements have been lacking from Chinese counterparts.

A second source agreed, stating they were facing immense pressure from inside financial institutions.\nThat may be about to change. Jeff Yang, a former developer at IBM now running a startup focusing on smart contract templates deployable on both Ethereum and Hyperledger, told Bitcoin Magazine that \u201cBlockchain is becoming hot in China\u201d and regulators are \u201cwelcoming\u201d of blockchain invention, but there is a lack of \u201creal code dev force.\u201d\u00a0\nYang said he is working with a top local Chinese bank, which is interested in using blockchain technology for \u201creal scenarios\u201d such as \u201cinterest rate swaps\u201d and is creating a presentation introducing Blockchain\u2019s use cases for a number of banking executives.\u201d\nIt is too early to state how blockchain technology may develop in China, but new blockchain-based companies are being formed almost daily, with interest in blockchain technology increasing considerably since late 2015. Globally, major IT companies, such as Intel, IBM and Cisco, have created a consortium, Hyperledger, with the aim of developing and maintaining an open source protocol for the use of smart contracts in a permissioned way for industrial use.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, R3 recently announced Corda, a blockchain-based protocol for financial applications which is soon to be open sourced.

Through parallel processing, it re-uses \u201coutputs that would otherwise be created and discarded on a continuous basis.\u201d Furthermore, it achieves gains on top of other optimizations such as \u201ctiming, pipelining, path balancing, custom cell and full custom designs.\u201d\nThe new technology is a result of algorithmic discoveries that \u201cwere widely believed to be impossible,\u201d allowing for a reduction in chip silicon area and lower power consumption by using fewer gates for each hashing core. This shortcuts the number of computations required for mining, as the mining hardware can re-use information acquired over time or share information with other hashing cores.\n\u201cChip designers get a game-changing improvement over whatever they already have achieved today,\u201d says technology inventor Hanke. \u201cFor the Bitcoin mines of the future, AsicBoost will make all the difference between a profitable and an unprofitable mine.\u201d\nThe results have the potential to lead to a dramatic improvement in performance in a zero sum industry where every little gain counts.\nThe Arms Race in Bitcoin\u2019s Mining Industry\nBitcoin mining has always been a competitive endeavor with the short-lived CPU mining period quickly giving way to GPUs, followed by ASICs. Considered an arms race as each hash-share gain increases profits at the expense of competitors, competition is intense, with hardware constantly improved and older versions quickly becoming obsolete.\nA dramatic illustration can be seen during a three-month period between December 2015 to March 2016 when difficulty more than doubled from 75 petahash to 175 petahash, more than halving the reward for mining hardware in use during December 2015. The increase in difficulty followed an increase in price which reached a low of approximately $170 in 2015 to stand currently at $440.\nThe stakes can be high. Aquifer filed for bankruptcy in February 2015, claiming Bitcoin mining-related losses between $1 million and $10 million. In the same year, BTC Guild, one of the oldest mining pools, closed. Mining companies, therefore, are in constant search for more efficiency, leading to specialization.\nSome miners, such as Genesis Mining, provide customer-focused services, such as cloud mining. Other companies, such as F2Pool, own no hardware, focusing instead on running a mining pool used by cloud mining providers, innovative mining businesses such as HaoBTC or small miners with few terahashes. Still other miners, such as BitFury and Antpool/Bitmain, design their own hardware and sell mining hardware to the public, as well as running a mining pool.\nThe current level of profitability for mining farms, which employ rows upon rows of mining hardware, is unclear, with few willing to provide concrete numbers. Jihan Wu, cofounder of Bitmain, one of the largest mining pools and home of the recently announced Antminer S7, told Bitcoin Magazine that the level of profitability depends on electricity prices as well as the cost of mining rigs, but he could not provide specific numbers.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, BitFury launched a new 16nm SHA256 ASIC to \u201cdeliver the maximum performance and efficiency possible\u201d according to its website. BitFury recently announced an investment in BitPesa for an undisclosed amount as well as a new project to build a \u201cblockchain-based\u00a0property registry\u201d having previously donated $100,000 to MIT\u2019s Digital Currency Initiative developers fund, according to Alex Petrov of BitFury who told Bitcoin Magazine that it was BitFury\u2019s initiative to create the fund which supports Bitcoin developers.\u00a0\nWith mining revenue dependent on the strength of the Bitcoin ecosystem, and as its profits grow through efficiency gains, we may expect more investments and diversification. Meanwhile, the mining-efficiency race, which has built the world\u2019s most powerful supercomputer to secure the $7 billion Bitcoin ecosystem, continues.", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 29}

Both claim Wright provided sufficient proof - including cryptographic proof - to convince them Wright is the man who invented Bitcoin. A third digital currency veteran \u2013 R3 architect Ian Grigg \u2013 followed up with a blog post confirming the revelation as well, and said Wright led a small team, which also consisted of Dave Kleiman, who died in 2013.\nA large segment of the Bitcoin community remains skeptical of Wright's claims, however. Most important, as first discovered by Bitonic CEO Jouke Hofman, the cryptographic signature posted as proof by Wright turned out to be publicly available \u2013 not something only Satoshi would have known. The invalidity of this proof was later confirmed by both Bitcoin Core and Libbitcoin developers, with Bitcoin Core developer Jonas Schnelli even calling Wright out as a scammer.\nIn the wake of the news, the Bitcoin Core development team decided to revoke Andresen's commit access out of fear the former lead developer's account may have been hacked. However, at Consensus 2016 in New York, Andresen\u00a0refuted these claims and confirmed he believes Wright really is Satoshi. Andresen also explained on Reddit that he had seen additional cryptographic evidence when he met Wright in London, but was not allowed to keep it.\nToday is not the first time Wright has made headlines as the alleged inventor of Bitcoin. In December of last year, both Wired\u00a0and Gizmodo\u00a0outed the Australian as Satoshi Nakamoto. Nor is this the first time these claims have been disputed. Following the December revelations, large parts of the story were quickly challenged by Bitcoin developers and the wider Bitcoin community.\nThis story is developing and will be updated as more information becomes available.", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 2}

Prosumers \u2012 a buzzword in the emerging sharing economy \u2012 are consumers who also put energy back into the network from domestic wind turbines and solar panels.\nThe European Union is aiming for an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2050, but European energy distribution networks are organized top-down, for large providers that distribute energy to consumers either directly or through smaller local providers.\nMore and more consumers are becoming prosumers, who produce part or all of their own energies with renewable \u201cgreen\u201d technologies such as solar energy, and are willing to trade energy with their peers. It\u2019s estimated that in countries like Belgium, 8 to 12 percent of households have become prosumers, and the trend is expected to continue. However, recent studies show that if 50 percent of households were to become energy-trading prosumers, the European energy distribution networks would become inefficient and waste significant amounts of green energy.\nLocal energy exchange grids could permit reducing wastes and making the system as a whole more efficient. But for this to happen the European power grids need to be turned into \u201csmart grids\u201d that permit producing and consuming energy locally, cutting down on the transmission loss which occurs over longer distances.\nEnter Scanergy, a scalable and modular system for energy trading between prosumers. The project, funded by the European Union\u2019s Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration, is based on an intelligent multi-agent system that can manage the electricity produced and consumed both on a lower level (dwellings and neighborhoods) as well as on a higher level (cities).\u00a0The Scanergy system enables the smart energy trade between prosumers, while coping with the inherent real-time dynamism in electricity demand and supply.\nThe project suggests an online currency to boost local trade between energy producers and consumers.\n\u201cProsumers create decentralized digital money themselves,\u201d says Mihail Mihaylov, a researcher at the AI lab of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB). \u201cThey want to know what their return on investment is. This is one problem our proposed concept addresses. We lower the risk of policy change.\u201d\nScanergy won the best demo award at the International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems in Istanbul in May 2015. The demo used featured a replica of a 62-home typical Belgian neighborhood complete with an electrical substation and tiny solar panels that drew power from a spotlight overhead.\nBesides the VUB, Sensing & Control Systems of Barcelona is participating in the Scanergy project. The company specializes in bringing to the market web-based solutions related to remote control, monitoring and real-time tracking in several markets, including energy management.\n\u201cNow our next step is to validate this in a real scenario, said Sergio Jurado, who coordinates the project at Sensing & Control Systems. \u201cWe need to work with producers and retailers in a large-scale deployment.\u201d\nThe Scanergy project includes a real-time automated market trading system called NRG-X-Change, Intel IQ \u00a0reported.\n\u201cThis exchange system checks the supply of renewables and the overall demand for electricity in a given neighborhood via its smart meters every 15 minutes, then automatically brokers trades with other neighborhoods for any excess or shortfall,\u201d according to Intel IQ. \u201cIt pays a Bitcoin-like digital currency the researchers call NRGcoin to those who feed energy back into the grid according to actual electricity usage rather than predicted usage.\u201d\nMihaylov, Jurado, and other researchers authored the paper \u201cNRGcoin: Virtual currency for trading of renewable energy in smart grids,\u201d published in the Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on the European Energy Market (EEM14).\nThe paper introduces NRGcoin. Prosumers in the smart grid trade locally produced renewable energy using NRGcoins, the value of which is determined on an open currency exchange market. Similar to Bitcoin, this currency offers numerous advantages over fiat currency, but, unlike Bitcoin, it is generated by injecting energy into the grid, rather than spending energy on computational power.\n\u201cIn addition, we propose a novel trading paradigm for buying and selling green energy in the smart grid,\u201d note the researchers. \u201cOur mechanism achieves demand response by providing incentives to prosumers to balance their production and consumption out of their own self-interest.\u201d\nThe interest demonstrated by the European Commission promises to stimulate the emerging sector of blockchain applications for prosumer-oriented, P2P energy markets. However, introducing yet another altcoin, instead of relying on the proven Bitcoin blockchain or the fast-growing Ethereum blockchain, seems awkward.\nAlso, giant administrations like the European Commission aren\u2019t known for moving with the agility needed by fast-developing emerging technology. In fact, as reported by Bitcoin Magazine earlier this week, the TransActive Grid project of Brooklyn Microgrid developer LO3 Energy and blockchain technology developer ConsenSys, a startup focused on Ethereum applications, is creating a connected smart grid for local energy exchange based on the Ethereum blockchain and has a working pre-operational prototype.\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 2}

But the existence of a genius protocol does not guarantee its success. For Bitcoin to thrive, there must be a great deal of social and economic change. To foster such change, the Bitcoin ecosystem needs better and more mature communications. It\u2019s a deficit that is costing the Bitcoin ecosystem in lost potential each day it persists.\nBitcoin and the blockchain are brilliant and fascinating technologies. But Bitcoin\u2019s social capital needs are manifold. To deliver on its promises of global financial inclusion, user-defined privacy, enhanced liberty and a stable money supply for all the world\u2019s people, the Bitcoin ecosystem needs a larger and more sophisticated community of software and protocol developers, greater assurance against mining centralization, and a thriving community of node operators. The embrace of the financial services community would speed adoption. Bitcoin needs the reality and perception of low volatility; it needs protocols and practices that assure privacy, flourishing marketplaces, a congenial regulatory environment and a positive reputation. (This list of social capital needs is drawn from this author\u2019s 2014\u00a0study of impediments to Bitcoin\u2019s success.)\nEfforts are going into developing Bitcoin\u2019s social capital. The\u00a0Open Bitcoin Privacy Project\u00a0is doing salutary work on the privacy piece.\u00a0Coin Center\u00a0is demystifying Bitcoin for regulators. But the dominant theme in Bitcoin-land remains the \u201cblock size debate,\u201d which will determine how Bitcoin adds capacity,\u00a0as it must. Perhaps it helps to frame the debate as\u00a0politics in a \u201cnon-political\u201d money system\u00a0and\u00a0governance by competition. Whatever the case, there is an ongoing failure to communicate and persuade.\nThe drawn-out block size debate does not undermine Bitcoin\u2019s essential genius. It just means that community members are burning a lot of energy on one dimension of the Bitcoin ecosystem, energy that is not available for other dimensions. The result is delay in achieving widely agreed-upon goals. Bitcoin will fail to achieve both its social potential and its potential value against major currencies while community members use their energies this way.\nIt\u2019s one thing to say that communications should improve, quite another to say how to improve them. But in a\u00a02011 study of government data transparency \u2014 which is harder to deliver than it sounds \u2014 I identified four key practices, two of which might be applied to the block size debate. Transparency improves if an authoritative source of information exists. Information sources should also be complete (a subset of \u201cavailability\u201d in the government data study). Information flows and uptakes work better if everyone knows where to look, and comes to rely on being fully informed by looking there.\nThe communications of Bitcoin Core advocates do not follow this model. The creation of the\u00a0Bitcoincore.org\u00a0website and other communications have been good faith efforts, but there has yet to emerge a source where the point of view and plans represented by Core can be found and digested. Instead, nuggets of information distribute themselves like Easter eggs across various forums and listservs.\nA non-technical expert should be able to look in on Bitcoin development and relatively easily learn what is happening: where we\u2019ve come from and where we\u2019re going; the risk management philosophy that animates Core; and other essentials. This information should be available in non-jargon to people of ordinary sophistication and experience. In the absence of such communication, scaling debates and others will probably be more intense and longer lasting. Investment won\u2019t flow and involvement in Bitcoin won\u2019t grow as it could.\nValue is a product of subjective belief. Communicating about Bitcoin will help foster growth in use and demand, raising the price of Bitcoin while serving human needs that are still dire in many parts of the world.\nCore is a disconnected group of people who may differ even with each other about important priorities and details in their vision. A cost of that form of organization is paid in greater misunderstanding, more time spent on debate and slower progress. It\u2019s a cost that can be mitigated.\nThe communications problem is particularly acute, though, when the block size debate undercuts other dimensions of the Bitcoin ecosystem. When debaters exhibit personal animosity toward others, make churlish comments and foment derision for the other side, they are signaling to observers of Bitcoin in important segments of society that Bitcoin is not an attractive thing to be involved in. They undercut Bitcoin acceptance among potential adopters.\nParticularly dismaying are the communications of a C-level executive at a prominent Chinese mining firm whose Twitter feed is often tart and disrespectful toward others. These public communications are available for anyone\u2019s perusal, of course, and they help fuel online chat that it is less than collegial and productive. His CEO cited to me no particular policy about company communications, saying that he prefers not to censor people and that he is not the \u201cfather\u201d or \u201cmaster\u201d of his employees. Rather, this executive\u2019s communications are consistent with \u201can understanding\u201d among them.\nThere is a belief among Bitcoin\u2019s \u201ctriumphal\u201d community that miners can be relied on to behave well because of their interests in profits. Markets may be perfect in the aggregate, but individual actors are not, and some may not recognize that insolence might be bad for business. Just like Core, Bitcoin companies can improve their communications and message control for the benefit of the ecosystem and themselves.\nA winnowing process is underway to determine who are the good businesspeople, technologists, pool operators and other Bitcoin ecosystem participants. The technologies that best scale Bitcoin will continue to be debated. The social capital Bitcoin needs will develop, including more and more mature communications. But it\u2019s a slow, human process, and the longer it takes, the slower Bitcoin's promises of global development, liberty, progress and profit will take to deliver.", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 3}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nChainAnchor is an MIT project that was brought to the attention of the Bitcoin community in late April\u00a0by Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd. In his blog post, Todd questioned whether this project may have been an attempt to bring Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance to Bitcoin.\nMIT Connection Science Managing Director David L. Shrier responded to Todd\u2019s blog post directly on Reddit, saying, \u201cChainAnchor was never intended for [B]itcoin.\u201d\nWhen first asked about why a preliminary version of the ChainAnchor paper discussed Bitcoin, Shrier pointed Bitcoin Magazine to another Reddit comment where he said, \u201c[ChainAnchor] was never intended to apply to Bitcoin. In the course of seven subsequent drafts, we have sought to clarify this.\u201d\nWhen then asked why there are explicit references to implementing ChainAnchor as an overlay on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, Shrier told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cIn a very early draft of the project, its focus on permissioned blockchains was not well explained, which is why we clarified.\u201d\nShrier went on to point to the current version of the ChainAnchor paper, which is more explicit about its use in permissioned ledgers (as opposed to permissionless blockchains such as Bitcoin) and dated two days prior to Todd\u2019s blog post; however, the preliminary draft provided by Todd on his blog stated:\n\n\u201cIn the second deployment mode \u2013 called the semipermissioned overlay \u2013 ChainAnchor is deployed as an overlay above the current permissionless public blockchain in Bitcoin. The goal of the overlay approach is not to create a separate chain, but rather use the current permissionless blockchain to carry permissioned-transactions relating to Users in ChainAnchor in such a way that non-ChainAnchor nodes are oblivious to the transactions belonging to a permissioned-group.\"\n\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to David Shrier again in regard to this excerpt specifically, and Shirer clarified, \u201cRigorous research requires exploring ideas, even ones that don't prove out. The \u2018semi-permissioned\u2019 idea wasn't a good idea (in my personal opinion), but one that we explored in the interests of rigor. It's not how the system was designed.\u201d\nMIT\u2019s ChainAnchor FAQ says the original draft of the paper \u201cmade several mentions of Bitcoin in order to provide both comprehensiveness and familiarity to the reader.\u201d\nIt\u2019s clear that the latest draft of the ChainAnchor paper is about permissioned blockchains and not Bitcoin, but Todd says multiple anonymous sources have told him the intention is to turn Bitcoin into a permissioned payment platform. Todd speculates that his sources are unable to talk due to nondisclosure agreements (NDA), but Shrier told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cThere are no NDAs around ChainAnchor. We have no idea what he's talking about.\u201d\nRegardless of the true intentions of those behind MIT\u2019s ChainAnchor project, the preliminary documents illustrate that the semi-permissioned overlay version of ChainAnchor, which is not found in newer versions of the paper, is a possible exploit for those who wish to attack Bitcoin.\nBribing Bitcoin Miners\nAlthough the idea of Bitcoin miners requiring users to identify themselves in order to use the network may seem ludicrous to some, the preliminary ChainAnchor paper outlines how miners could be coerced into this new, permissioned setup: by bribing them.\u00a0\nThe paper stated:\n\n\"In the ChainAnchor semi-permissioned overlay a successful miner receives a further additional payment (beyond the new coins and transaction fees in Bitcoin) for completing a block consisting only of permissioned-transactions.\"\n\nTo many, Bitcoin\u2019s main value proposition is its utility in censorship-resistant transactions on the Bitcoin network, but the incentives for miners to protect this feature may be skewed when an outside party offers a bonus for restricting block space access to an approved list of users.\nIn his recent post, Todd speculated about ChainAnchor\u2019s purpose:\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s likely going on here is ChainAnchor is trying to force people to register with their service by making non-compliant transactions from unregistered users cost more and take longer to be confirmed.\u201d\n\nNon-compliant transactions would take longer to confirm because they can be mined only by miners who are not part of the semi-permissioned overlay system.\nTodd also added that one of the main concerns he\u2019s heard from his sources is they do not wish to be involved in a scheme that attempts to take monopoly control over Bitcoin transactions. Again, it should be pointed out that the current version of ChainAnchor does not mention applying the concept to Bitcoin at all.\nRegardless of ChainAnchor Intentions, This Attack Is Possible\nRegardless of the true intentions of the individuals behind the ChainAnchor concept, it\u2019s important to note that this sort of attack is possible today. Indeed, miners get to pick which transactions they wish to include in the next block. In fact, some miners already block certain types of transactions from their mined blocks.\nIf a miner is offered enough money, he or she may decide to block transactions that aren\u2019t pre-approved by some sort of regulator. Of course, this setup would harm Bitcoin\u2019s fungibility, which is already rather weak. Once transactions are controlled in this manner, it\u2019s questionable whether Bitcoin would fit the definition of money.\nEven if a combination of Confidential Transactions and JoinMarket were implemented in Bitcoin by default, it wouldn\u2019t matter because miners would mine only transactions with real-world identities tied to them. At that point, Bitcoin users would have to search for alternatives (likely through a change in proof of work) that would resist these sorts of advances from bad actors.\nWhen asked whether this attack could work in practice, Todd told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cIt's hard to predict \u2012 exchanges could be forced into this scheme, at which point it'd be easy to get a subset of miners to start mining only permissioned blocks.\u201d\nWhen asked whether a change in proof of work (PoW) could ultimately block this sort of attack, Todd stated:\n\n\u201cDon't assume that's an easy thing to do; changing the PoW would be chaos, and could easily be engineered to be part of a 51 percent attack. When you change the PoW, you have to ask, who is in the best position to mine the new chain? If the new PoW isn't ASIC hard, it's very easy to temporarily rent or steal a large amount of computing power to attack it.\u201d\n\nTodd added, \u201cIf it is best mined on ASICs however, it's quite plausible that the new PoW algorithm will be chosen maliciously to match something someone has a big supply of ASICs for, again, a 51 percent attack.\u201d\nAlthough Todd is concerned with the implications of a permissioned overlay built on top of Bitcoin, one of the ChainAnchor paper\u2019s co-authors, MIT Internet Trust Consortium Technical Director Thomas Hardjono, told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n\u201cPart of how we helped establish the impracticality of ChainAnchor for an overlay on Bitcoin was ... the incentive to focus on compliant transactions. A miner would have to wait for such transactions to show up. Waiting means they lose money doing nothing (while other miners make money doing the usual mining of ordinary transactions.) This also helped reinforce our thinking as to why ChainAnchor was only feasible on permissioned blockchains.\"\n\nWhen asked about Hardjono\u2019s comments, Todd generally agreed, telling Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cIt's really quite simple: Bribing miners happens after you get some initial volume (e.g. driven by exchanges joining the system.) Taken at face value, it's stupid, too, as there's no technical reason for miners to exclusively mine permissioned transactions.\u201d\nIs Centralization Bitcoin\u2019s Biggest Weakness?\nAlthough this sort of attack is likely possible even with a much more decentralized group of Bitcoin miners, this sort of coercion is much easier when there are only a handful of people who have to be convinced to bring permissioned-access to Bitcoin\u2019s supposedly permissionless network.\nTodd has discussed the issues related to the centralization of Bitcoin mining quite often in the past, and in his post about ChainAnchor, he wrote:\n\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting about this threat is the attacker is trying to change the composition of the mining community itself from less to more regulated, using profitability as a weapon. As defenders \u2012 and protocol designers \u2012 we have to figure out what kind(s) of miner we\u2019re trying to encourage to achieve our goals, and how to ensure the economic incentives of the system keep those miners profitable.\u201d\nIronically, Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra recently warned about the threat that centralization of mining is to Bitcoin\u2019s censorship resistance at the 2016 MIT Bitcoin Expo.\nA solution to Bitcoin\u2019s mining centralization problem is not entirely clear, but some members of the community, such as 21, believe the mining process will eventually become massively distributed and decentralized once again.\nThere has been speculation as to whether Bitcoin Foundation Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen may be involved with this project. Andresen responded to this claim directly in a recent Reddit Ask Me Anything (AMA) by stating, \u201cI have never heard of ChainAnchor until this question. I don\u2019t have any relationships with any projects that are working on digital identity.\u201d\nIf you wish to learn more about ChainAnchor, some MIT Connection Science team members will be participating in an AMA on the /r/Bitcoin subreddit on May 3 at 5 p.m. Eastern.", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 3}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe Australian computer scientist Craig Steven Wright is sending shock waves throughout the Bitcoin world, as he once again claims to be the man who invented Bitcoin.\nAt the heart of the story, Wright himself published a\u00a0blog post suggesting he signed a message with one of Satoshi Nakamoto's private keys. And importantly, Wright's claim was backed by Bitcoin-prominents including former lead developer\u00a0Gavin Andresen and former Bitcoin Foundation director\u00a0Jon Matonis; both believe to have witnessed Wright sign a message with Satoshi Nakamoto's private key.\nYet, the Bitcoin community remains highly skeptical. The answers to these seven questions explain why.\n1. What does it mean to \u201csign a message\u201d?\nThe option to sign a message is a feature of public key cryptography, the type of cryptography on which Bitcoin is based.\nPublic key cryptography makes use of two types of keys: public keys and private keys. Both are really just strings of numbers that correspond through a mathematical formula. But while it is very easy to calculate a public key from a private key, it is practically impossible to calculate a private key from a public key. It's a \u201cone way street.\"\nA private key can also be combined with any other data using a similar mathematical formula. This data could even be text or images; in that case the data is first hashed (\u201ctranslated\u201d) into a string of numbers (a \u201chash,\"\u00a0or \u201cdigest\u201d).\nCombining a private key and other data creates a new\u00a0and unique\u00a0string of numbers, called a signature. And again, it is easy to calculate a signature from a private key and data, but it is practically impossible to calculate the private key or data from the signature.\nAnd here's where the magic of cryptography kicks in: with only the public key\u00a0and the data, it's possible to verify whether the signature was created using the corresponding private key. Message\u00a0signing therefore proves ownership of the specific private key corresponding to a given public key, without needing to reveal that private key.\nIn Bitcoin's case, signing is typically used to spend bitcoins. The \u201cowner\u201d of a bitcoin signs the hash part\u00a0of a transaction, as such approving that bitcoins are effectively sent \u201cfrom\u201d his public key, \u201cto\u201d another public key.\n2. What could Wright do to prove he is Satoshi Nakamoto?\nThat is a tricky question, as the answer\u00a0differs from one person to the next.\nThat said, many agree that Wright should at least be able to sign a message using a private key that only Satoshi should posses \u2013 which is indeed what Wright and others suggest he has done.\nThere's really only one private key we know for sure belongs to Satoshi Nakamoto: the private key corresponding to the public key on which the first-ever bitcoins were mined, as embedded in the so-called \u201cGenesis Block.\"\u00a0Additionally, there is\u00a0anecdotal evidence that the private key used for the\u00a0first-ever typical Bitcoin transaction belongs to Satoshi Nakamoto as well. It's also likely that Satoshi Nakamoto should posses many other private keys included in early Bitcoin blocks, as well as the\u00a0private key that corresponds to a\u00a0well-known public key (which is stored on a key server), but all this is harder to establish with the same level of certainty.\nSo, to prove he is Satoshi Nakamoto, Wright could sign a message using the private key corresponding to the public key from the Genesis block. Or, maybe, corresponding to the first-ever Bitcoin transaction. (Or he could spend bitcoins associated with these addresses; though of course it might be a bit more tricky to prove it was he\u00a0who moved the coins, and not someone else.)\nIf done correctly, anyone should be able to verify the results.\nIt wouldn't really matter what kind of message Wright signs. Though it would help if the message itself identifies Wright as the creator of Bitcoin as well. And it should preferably be done in a controlled setting, so that only those in the room know which message is signed.\nThe message could for instance read:\n\u201cI, Craig Steven Wright, am Satoshi Nakamoto.\u201d\n3. Did Wright publish a signature corresponding to a private key only Satoshi should posses?\nTechnically: yes! (But not in any meaningful way.)\nIn his blog post, Wright published a signature that corresponds to both a hash (also published in his blog post), as well as to the private key used to make the first Bitcoin transaction.\nSo far so good.\nBut what Wright did not mention - and this seems very deceitful - is which data he used to create the hash he supposedly signed. And as it turns out, Wright did not sign a hash of a Jean Paul Sartre text, as he seemed to suggest in his blog post. Nor did he sign a hash of a message identifying himself as the creator of Bitcoin, as suggested above.\nInstead, and without disclosing this information, Wright signed a hash of the first Bitcoin transaction--or rather, he claimed to.\u00a0\nAnd remember, signing a transaction hash is how Bitcoin transactions are approved. Plus, of course, the signature itself is part of that transaction as well; it was included by Satoshi Nakamoto to approve of the transaction.\nThe absurdity of the \u201cevidence\u201d needs repeating.\nWright literally re-published a signature created by Satoshi Nakamoto seven years ago, using nothing but information that is already publicly available in Bitcoin's blockchain.\nSo while Wright technically published a valid Satoshi Nakamoto signature, that doesn't prove he is Satoshi Nakamoto, any more than publishing a signed Babe Ruth baseball card would have proven he is Babe Ruth.\n4. Did Wright create any other signatures corresponding to private keys that only Satoshi should possess?\nAndresen, Matonis and several journalists claim that Wright, in their presence, signed additional messages with private keys only Satoshi should possess.\nSo how did that happen?\nAccording to Andresen, and as reported by\u00a0Wired, Wright is said to have signed the message: \u201cGavin\u2019s favorite number is eleven,\u201d\u00a0combined with Wright's initials, \u201cCSW.\"\u00a0Wright did this on his own computer, and then loaded the signature on a USB-stick provided by Andresen. This signature was transferred to what Andresen believed to be a newly bought, factory-sealed laptop provided by Wright's assistant. On this computer, they installed Electrum's Bitcoin wallet software, which can be used to sign and verify messages.\nThe signature as provided by Wright was checked against the message and one of Satoshi's public keys. According to the software (and after a failed attempt that didn't include Wright's initials in the message), the signature checked out.\nUnfortunately, Andresen says he was not allowed to take the signature data with him; allegedly Wright feared Andresen would leak it. As such, it is impossible to cryptographically verify any part of this story.\nAs for Matonis's part of the story, as well as for the other journalists, not as many details are known. But so far none of them have delivered any cryptographic evidence either; and it seems unlikely they will.\n5. Did Wright trick Andresen, Matonis\u00a0and others?\nWright almost certainly attempted to trick readers of his blog post; there seems to be no other rational explanation. This has led many to believe he may have also attempted to trick Andresen, Matonis and the journalists,\u00a0and did so successfully. Speaking to Wired, Andresen himself, too, acknowledged there is the possibility that Wright \u201cbamboozled\u201d him \u2013 though he considers it unlikely.\nSo how could Wright have possibly tricked Andresen, Matonis\u00a0and the other journalists?\nThe easiest way to pull this off\u00a0might have been the use of fake Electrum software. This fake software could, for instance, have been modified to approve any string of numbers as a valid signature. (Or perhaps any string of numbers as long as the inserted message includes Wright's initials \u2013 which fits the story.)\nWhile this is definitely a very speculative explanation, Electrum's logs do\u00a0suggest that no verification data was downloaded on the day Andresen met Wright. This at least suggests Andresen didn't check if the Electrum software was legit.\nSo how, then, could Wright have managed to install fake Electrum software on a brand new computer, even though he did this together with Andresen?\nAs Andresen himself suggested, this could have been done by hacking into the hotel wifi, to host a fake Electrum website with the fake software. Or, perhaps slightly easier, a fake hotel wifi (deceptively named \u201cHotel Wifi\u201d) could have been set\u00a0up near their room, to pull off a similar trick.\nOr, perhaps the new, factory-sealed laptop was not really new or factory-sealed at all, and only made to look that way.\nThere are probably other tricks possible. But again this is all speculation.\n6. Is anyone else backing Wright's story?\nYes.\nShortly after Wright's media storm ignited, two more digital currency veterans spoke out to back Wright's claims:\u00a0R3\u00a0architect Ian Grigg, and\u00a0New Liberty Dollar issuer Joseph Vaughn Perling.\nGoing into more detail in a\u00a0blog post, Grigg claims that Wright was part of a small team behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, which would have also included the late Dave Kleiman. Grigg also notes that the team suffered much distress throughout the past years, suggesting Wright deserves to be left in\u00a0peace now.\nPerling did not provide much more background information, though his tweets echoed a similar sentiment as Grigg's: Wright \u2013 who is the man behind Satoshi Nakamoto \u2013 experiences much distress, and deserves some privacy.\nAs opposed to Andresen and Matonis, however, Grigg and Perling do not claim to have seen cryptographic evidence. Nor have they provided any.\n7. So... Is Wright Satoshi Nakamoto or not?\nAll we know is that no cryptographic proof has been provided so far \u2013 worse yet, the only \u201ccryptographic proof\u201d Wright has provided so far is provably deceitful.\nHowever, in Wright's\u00a0latest blog post, he announced he will move some of Satoshi's coins (which is equivalent to signing a message). Unfortunately, the blog post itself was not signed, nor did it include a signature.\nSo for now, we can only speculate... and wait.\nThanks to\u00a0Libbitcoin\u00a0lead developer Eric Voskuil and\u00a0Bitonic\u00a0CEO Jouke Hofman for fact checking.", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 3}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nSegregated Witness has entered its\u00a0 final testing stage before roll-out on the Bitcoin network. That is\u00a0 good news, most importantly because the innovation introduces a capacity increase to allow for more transactions on the network, while it also solves\u00a0 transaction malleability.\nAnd, it introduces script versioning \u2012 an extension to the Bitcoin protocol that allows for an entire new category of innovation.\nOne of these imminent innovations has been on the top of several Bitcoin developers\u2019 wish-lists for some time: Schnorr signatures.\nWith the impending release of Segregated Witness, implementation of the Schnorr cryptographic signature algorithm might follow soon after, potentially improving Bitcoin's scalability, efficiency and privacy, all in one go.\nHere's how.\nSignatures\nFirst, a brief re-cap: what are signatures?\nAt the heart of Bitcoin lies the mathematical trick called \u201cpublic key cryptography,\u201d a cryptographic system that uses two kinds of \u201ckeys\u201d (really strings of numbers): private keys and public keys.\nA private key and a public key are mathematically linked. But while it's very easy to produce a public key from a private key, it's practically impossible to produce the private key from a public key. It's a \u201cone-way street.\u201d\nIn order to spend bitcoins from a particular Bitcoin address, one must prove \u201cownership\u201d (or: knowledge) of the private key that refers to the public key associated with that address. And to prove ownership of a private key, without having to reveal that private key, a cryptographic signature is used.\nA signature is created by performing a calculation using the transaction data and the private key. And here's where the magic of public key cryptography comes in: Knowing the public key, anyone can see if the correct private key was used to create the signature. Without ever needing to know the private key itself.\nThe \u201cowner\u201d of the private key can therefore sign a transaction and spend bitcoins without worrying that someone else can take that private key and steal the bitcoins; the private key is never exposed, and the signature is only valid for that specific transaction.\n(For a more elaborate explanation of public key cryptography in Bitcoin, see\u00a0 this article. Or, just keep reading. While the basic signature concept matters, the details are not crucial for the purpose of this article.)\nSchnorr\nSo what, then, are Schnorr signatures?\nSchnorr, named after its inventor Claus-Peter Schnorr, is a signature scheme: the series of mathematical rules that link the private key, public key and signature together. Many cryptographers consider Schnorr signatures the best in the field, as they offer a strong level of correctness, do not suffer from malleability, are relatively fast to verify, and \u2012 importantly \u2012 support multisignature: several signatures can be aggregated into a single, new signature.\nHowever, until now it has not been possible to utilize Schnorr in Bitcoin. Another type of signature scheme, Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), is baked into the Bitcoin protocol, and changing that would require a hard fork.\nThat's where Segregated Witness comes in.\nWith Segregated Witness, all signature data is moved to a separate part of the transaction: the witness, which is not embedded in the \u201cold\u201d Bitcoin protocol. And thanks to script versioning, almost any rule applied in the witness can be changed through a soft fork. Including the type of signature scheme used.\nThis opens the door for Schnorr.\nCapacity\nThe Schnorr property that stands to benefit Bitcoin most is multisignature aggregation.\nMany Bitcoin transactions include multiple inputs, referring to the addresses bitcoins are sent from. (This can be compared to how cash payments often consist of multiple smaller bills and coins to pay a larger sum of money.) Right now, all these inputs require their own signature, which means all these signatures must be included in a transaction, all must be transmitted over the network, and all must be included in a block.\nWith Schnorr, however, all inputs will instead require only one combined signature to represent all these different signatures. This offers an obvious data advantage, as only one signature must be included in a transaction, only one must be transmitted over the network, and only one must be included in a block. This means there's more room for transactions.\nFor example:\nSegregated Witness, as proposed by Bitcoin Core, offers a (roughly) 75 percent discount on all data included in the witness rather than the original block. One megabyte of witness data is therefore \u201cweighed\u201d as .25 megabyte, which would leave room for .75 megabyte transaction data in the original block, for a total of 1 megabyte.\nIf aggregated Schnorr signatures reduce the total size of witness data, say from 1 megabyte to .5 megabyte, this .5 megabyte would then be discounted to 0.125 megabyte, leaving room for up to 0.875 megabyte in the original block. (A capacity increase of about 17 percent.)\nThe exact amount of added room depends on the types of transactions included in blocks. But rough estimates by Bitcoin Core developer Eric Lombrozo suggest that Schnorr signatures could eventually increase total capacity 40 percent or more \u2013 that\u2019s on top of the added 60 to 100 percent already offered by Segregated Witness.\nMultisig\nThe capacity increase as described above is true for regular transactions, as many transactions include more than one input. But the advantage can be even greater in the case of multisig transactions \u2012 transactions where a single input itself requires several signatures (typically from different people).\nAs with normal transactions, no more than a single signature needs to be included in any multisig transaction. No matter how many signatures are\u00a0required, no matter how many people involved.\nThis opens the door to vastly more complex smart contract constructions, for a fraction of the data normally required. Whether it's two-of-three, three-of-fifteen or hundred-of-hundred types of multisig transactions, all will carry the same amount of signature data as a typical single-signature transaction.\nPrivacy\nAnd third, Schnorr signatures could offer another interesting benefit: incentivized privacy.\nAs mentioned, one transaction can include multiple inputs. Most commonly, these inputs refer to addresses that are all controlled by the same person. (As per the multiple bills and coins example.)\nBut a privacy-enhancing trick invented by Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell,\u00a0 CoinJoin, allows different users to combine all their transactions into a single transaction. That one transaction will include multiple inputs coming from different payers, which sends money to multiple outputs, belonging to different payees.\n(This can be compared to a group of people throwing their bills and coins together in a basket, which they use to go shopping in different stores to buy the products all of them want. Each individual will get the goods that individual paid for, but it's unlikely any individual's \u201cown\u201d bill paid for the product that individual bought.)\nIf done right, CoinJoin is a great way to improve privacy on the Bitcoin protocol, as it becomes unclear which inputs paid which outputs exactly, let alone which person paid which person.\nCoinJoin is not a\u00a0new concept. But up until now CoinJoin was typically a bit of a hassle. As such, most people don't bother. And since most people don't bother, those who do bother could automatically be marked as suspicious; potentially defeating the purpose of using CoinJoin in the first place.\nBut Schnorr signatures can add a new advantage to CoinJoin. It enables all participants in a CoinJoin transaction to not only combine their transactions, but to also combine their signatures. And doing so means the size of the transaction would actually be smaller than all individual transactions combined. Which, in turn, means miners would typically charge a smaller fee to process the transaction.\nWith Schnorr, therefore, CoinJoin would not only increase privacy, but also \u2013 importantly \u2013 lower the costs for everyone involved. Indeed, there would be a cost benefit to use the most private option, which might just make it the go-to option for everyone \u2013 vastly increasing Bitcoin privacy for all.\nNote: The process of implementing Schnorr signatures in Bitcoin is still in the concept phase. While most Bitcoin Core developers seem to believe Schnorr signatures can be safely deployed in Bitcoin, it is too early to say with certainty.\nThanks to Bitcoin Core developer and\u00a0 Blockstream co-founder Dr. Pieter Wuille for providing information, and Bitcoin Core developer and\u00a0 Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo for proofreading and further suggestions.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 14}

He is a fintech entrepreneur within the payments industry who has been active in the groundbreaking blockchain and Bitcoin ecosystem since 2013. His vision is to create a next generation payment system by utilizing decentralized applications and harness the true potential hidden between contactless payments and blockchain technology.\n\u00a0\nWith the advent of blockchain technology, a brand new term has emerged: \u201cdecentralized applications,\u201d also known as smart contracts. A decentralized application is a novel concept that acts as a secure and public agreement between a distributed ledger such as Bitcoin or Ethereum and one or more of its users.\u00a0\nThe main advantages for traditional payment systems (such as debit card infrastructure) to connect with blockchain technology are transparency and security. Positive side effects include a reduction of operational costs, as well as fees charged to customers. And because all transactions and contracts are verified independently by the blockchain itself, this adds the ability to automate audits, accounting and record-keeping.\nDecentralized applications can automate business processes and exchange systems in a transparent and immutable manner. The key attribute is that these contracts are not enforced by human entities and organizations, but rather by consensus and mathematics. This ensures that reliable and time-stamped records of transactions and trades continue to exist even if the centralized site and interface go offline, and cannot be altered or deleted by anyone, even the administrator of the system. It also means that within this system, trades and contracts continue to work without the reliability on a centralized system.\nUsers and employees therefore have the guarantee that the records of their activity will not vanish or be muddled should the site go down or be manipulated. These records are stored across a distributed computer network, which is secured by high degrees of redundancy, transaction chaining, and proof-of-work incentivizing of miners. And considering that decentralized applications are brand new and highly programmable (in some cases, Turing-complete), many significant use cases have not yet been explored.\nRecently, major players such as Nasdaq and NYSE have also been looking into blockchain technology for securities trading, and other financial tools such as options and bets. Because the counterparty in these cases is effectively the blockchain itself rather than an individual or an organization, it not only creates a high degree of trust but also stands as a fully reliable, untamperable system that is independent of other factors. Many financial institutions react to this as if it were venom, as they cannot tolerate the idea that their own platform may be outside of their ownership or influence.\u00a0\nIn the context of payments and commerce, decentralized applications can be used to create a gateway where users pay with bitcoins, but merchants receive the equivalent payment in their local fiat currency. Here an autonomous application would track all trades, and automatically signal the release of fiat from an escrow account after a digital currency deposit has been completed. While interacting with fiat is by definition centralized, decentralizing most or all other business processes still contains more than enough potential to introduce new payment efficiencies and features.\nFurther universal payment availability can be achieved for Bitcoin payments if handled by a peer-to-peer exchange and the liquidity provided by other users rather than a centralized entity such as a Bitcoin payment processor, or the service itself. This reduces permit requirements, as well as the risk of losing user funds (since none are being held by the service itself.)\u00a0\nIn such a gateway, users sell their digital currencies to traders on a decentralized exchange (application), and traders then provide fiat in return, which is then forwarded to a virtual debit card associated with the user\u2019s account, and the merchant is paid via the aforementioned card. This occurs behind the scenes, while users retain the impression that they are seamlessly paying with a digital currency.\u00a0\nThis means that traders provide fiat, consumers pay with their digital currency of choice and the merchant receives his or her preferred local currency (USD, EUR, GDP, etc.) once the payment is completed. This means that the exchange itself occurs without interaction or initial incentive by the merchant, and relies instead on a more \"client-side\" approach. This gives users the option to decide where to spend their digital currencies, with a wide range of choices provided by existing and very widespread debit card infrastructure.\n\u00a0\nConclusion\n\nBlockchain is coming to disrupt your industry \u2013 Deloitte.\u00a0\n\nThis could not be more accurate, as the technology evolves by demand from millennials and moves more toward transparency and cost-efficiency. The current trend and the growing number of entrepreneurs and freelancers shows that over the next few years structuring a business model on the blockchain technology is going to be more common. The most startling innovation we will witness is consumers using the technology on a daily basis without being aware of it. Many of the most significant use cases for this technology have not been discovered yet.\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 15}

Forough's\u00a0aim was to empower half of the Afghanistan population through education to improve the economy, while putting underserved women on a path to financial independence.\nCurrently providing a safe educational environment for 50 female students aged 15-25, Code to Inspire is helping change the way women are seen in a country where women face barriers among conservative families and extremists.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Forough said it can be challenging to work in an environment where women are not encouraged to receive the same education as their male counterparts.\n\u201cGirls in Afghanistan lack safe places to study and learn. Girls in Afghanistan lack employment opportunities, specifically in technology,\u201d she said. \u201cOnly 16 percent of Afghan women are employed while 2014 saw only 20 percent of public universities taking in female students.\u201d\nIn a bid to bridge the gap between female and male education, Code to Inspire\u2019s goal is to improve women\u2019s economic and social advancement in Afghanistan\u2019s growing tech industry. By offering courses in coding, access to technology and professional resources in addition to job placement, CTI students have a greater chance of attaining employment that is both financially rewarding and socially accessible.\n\u201cAccess to the wealth of the global technology economy enables CTI students to add unique value to their households and their communities, and to challenge the traditional gender roles in Afghanistan with the best argument out there--results,\u201d said Forough.\nIn a part of the world which has islands of human population separated by forbidding terrain, where safety and security make it impossible for women to travel, and where wired Internet isn\u2019t common, phone coverage is the next best thing. So much so, that according to recent statistics from Afghanistan\u2019s Ministry of Communication and Information Technology, more than 89 percent of the population has telecom coverage with 23.2 million phone users in the country out of Afghanistan\u2019s population of around 33 million.\nNot only that, but 51 companies have been issued licenses to provide Internet services while around 3 million people (10 percent of the country\u2019s population)\u00a0have\u00a0access to the Internet.\nThe Internet's universal accessibility\u00a0allows\u00a0women the opportunity to work from home; however, in order to do so they have to be able to offer something to potential employers, which is where Code to Inspire is making a positive change.\n\u201cIn areas where women\u2019s travel can be heavily restricted, the ability to work remotely is a key tool in the push for equality,\u201d said Forough.\nConsidering that CTI has only been around since 2015, it has managed to receive funding and donations through individuals and corporate donors who believe in its mission to help the women in Afghanistan.\n\u201cLast summer, CTI did its first online crowdfunding through Indiegogo where we raised $22,000,\u201d said Forough. \u201cWe\u2019ve also received donations from Github, Malala Fund, GooglersGive program, BitFury, and 20 laptops from Overstock.\u201d\nUsing Bitcoin for Financial Freedom\nOf course, once the women graduate and find jobs through the Internet there is still the issue of how they get paid.\nIn Afghanistan payment processing can be quite difficult. PayPal does not operate in Afghanistan, and while Western Union is available, its fees are very costly. Forough said that to deal with the issue of payment CTI turned its\u00a0attention to Bitcoin.\n\u201cWith my former foundation Digital Citizen Fund, we used to pay our content providers in Afghanistan through our corporate partner BitLanders, which was formerly known as Film Annex, in U.S. dollars,\u201d she said. \u201cThe majority of users were girls who were too young to have a bank account or they were unbanked, so to make the payment process faster and\u00a0more reliable,\u00a0with lower\u00a0fees per transaction, we switched to paying our users in Bitcoin.\u201d\nThe use of Bitcoin is an important initiative for Code to Inspire, as it provides women in developing countries with a powerful tool that enables them to connect quickly and affordably with the\u00a0global economy.\nNot only are women in Afghanistan gaining access to an education, but where it is taboo for women to step out of their doors unattended, Bitcoin allows them to fully participate in the world.\nCode to Inspire\u2019s objective is financial inclusion, which is not just about having a bank account. For an economy to be inclusive, women need equal access to opportunity, which is where the nonprofit is making headway.\n\u201cWhat social media did for communication, cryptocurrency promises to do for women\u2019s autonomy. In a society that lacks banks, blockchain technology like Bitcoin offers a secure, transparent way to add value,\u201d said Forough. \u201cMost importantly, it affords those marginalized by the brick-and-mortar finance system a chance to participate in the economy on their own terms.\u201d\nWhile it is easy for women in Afghanistan to sign up to access Bitcoin, Forough notes that there are challenges within the country that make it difficult for people to embrace digital currencies.\n\u201cThere is no platform that can support converting Bitcoin to Afghanistan\u2019s currency,\u201d she said.\nThis, however, seems to be a minor issue considering the massive strides that Afghanistan has made for gender equality over the past 15 years. Once women were barred from receiving an education, working outside the home\u00a0or even dressing as they saw fit.\nDuring the Taliban regime there were only 900,000 male students in the country; however, this has now increased to 9 million students including\u00a04.2 million females. Additionally, during the 2014 elections, 40 percent of those who voted were women; and\u00a0four out of 25 cabinet ministers are now women.\n\u201cThanks to recent technological innovations it doesn\u2019t matter where you are located as long as you can access the Internet,\u201d said Forough. \u201cIf you combine education with technology, students will be more innovative and productive so\u00a0they can access the most up-to-date information and be inspired by the\u00a0achievements of others.\u201d\nThe most important thing for Forough is that by working online and getting paid online, the women can become financially independent, a goal that Code to Inspire continues to accomplish.\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 14}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nBitcoin Core contributor Jonas Schnelli was recently featured in a panel discussion about improvements to Bitcoin at the 2016 MIT Bitcoin Expo. During the Q&A; portion of the panel, an audience member asked the participants about the previous presentation by the World Bitcoin Network\u2019s James D\u2019Angelo in which he articulated the idea of replacing miners with elected officials.\nIn general, the panel, which also featured Blockstream core tech engineer Mark Friedenbach, Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra and Lightning Network co-creator Joseph Poon, had a negative reaction to the concept of using democracy to handle changes to Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules. Schnelli used his experience with direct democracy in Switzerland to make his points.\nVoting Requires an Informed Public\nAlthough Schnelli has a positive take on Switzerland\u2019s use of direct democracy, he does not view the system as a useful option for Bitcoin. In his view, the intricate, technical details of Bitcoin make direct democracy a poor choice for governance. Schnelli explained:\n\u201cVoting or democracy is good, but I live in Switzerland \u2012 one of the only countries where we have direct democracy \u2012 and with democracy you need to understand the topic you\u2019re going to vote about. Who is able to vote about Bitcoin technical topics? Even the miners \u2012 they don\u2019t really get the technical essence of the problem.\u201d\nIndeed, many representatives of Bitcoin\u2019s network hashrate have decided to default to Bitcoin Core on development issues. Although there is widespread support for a 2-megabyte block size limit among Chinese exchanges and mining pools, those companies are, as of now, willing to accept that change only if it comes from Bitcoin Core.\nOn the topic of voting on changes to the Bitcoin protocol, Schnelli added:\n\u201cVoting means you really need to fully understand what you\u2019re going to vote about. As soon as you say everybody needs to vote \u2012 everybody needs to study the problem for a couple of days \u2012 is it realistic? Who is able to judge?\u201d\nLobbying and Propaganda Come with Voting\nSchnelli also is uncomfortable with bringing some of the negative aspects of politics into development decisions related to Bitcoin. He noted:\n\u201cWith voting comes also, kind of, lobbying \u2012 people and companies collecting money to influence people. I see that back in Switzerland where we vote about law changes, not the president. It\u2019s all about money and propaganda.\u201d\nTrace Mayer, a longtime investor in Bitcoin and Bitcoin-centric companies, recently shared similar thoughts on who should be making decisions related to the protocol. In his view, there is no competition for the experienced contributors to Bitcoin Core. Mayer also has stated that Bitcoin is a meritocracy, which is a form of governance where power is awarded to individuals based on their abilities.\nProponents of a more democratic approach to Bitcoin governance, such as Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Bitcoin Classic developer Gavin Andresen, say their vision of Bitcoin governance would allow the protocol to evolve and adapt more efficiently over time.\nBitcoin Is a Technical Topic\nSchnelli summed up his thoughts on democracy for Bitcoin governance during his final comments in regard to the audience member\u2019s question. He stated:\n\u201cI mean, I like [the direct democracy in Switzerland], but it\u2019s this political thing; it\u2019s not technical stuff. It\u2019s something everybody can talk about. But can the people in Bitcoin talk about what they really want?\u201d\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

But purists might point out that real revolutions sweep away existing institutions. That hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d he said, but warned: \u201cwithout change, banks could go the way of other businesses that failed to adapt to changing times.\u201d\n\nIn potentially historic closing remarks Curry stated:\n\n\u201cIf there is a revolution underway in financial services ... those of you in retail banking are on the frontlines.

She was commenting on the recent announcement of an unprecedented partnership between Barclays and Circle. U.S. regulators have noticed and they are now loudly asking for a shift in the way fintech companies are regulated.\nThe debate was opened by CFTC\u2019s Commissioner J. Christopher Giancarlo, who hailed the benefits of blockchain and called for a light-touch regulatory approach similar to the strategy employed in the early days of the Internet. He made the remarks in a special address to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation 2016 Blockchain Symposium last week.\n\u201c[A] dramatic example of the potential benefits to regulators of blockchain technology is in the collapse of Lehman Brothers,\u201d Giancarlo said.\nSince then, the OCC issued a white paper calling for comments and suggestions on how to regulate \u201cresponsible innovation.\u201d In opening remarks about the white paper, Curry stated:\n\n\u201c[R]apid and dramatic advances in financial technology are beginning to disrupt the way traditional banks do business. \u2026 At the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), we are making certain that institutions with federal charters have a regulatory framework that is receptive to responsible innovation along with the supervision that supports it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, London races ahead. In a speech at Money 20/20 Europe, Hannah Nixon, managing director of U.K.\u2019s Payment Systems Regulator, a first-of-its-kind independent regulator, highlighted Britain\u2019s enthusiasm for financial innovation in stating:\n\u201c[W]e want to encourage technological innovation. Not for innovation\u2019s sake, but to drive improvements for users, helping payment companies find new and ever more convenient ways for people to pay.\n\u201cIn fact, we want the U.K. industry to become a center of innovation, to lead the world in the development of payment systems. And I believe the PSR can play a major part in that.\n\u201cWe want people to look at U.K. payment systems and the PSR, and say, \u2018We want to do it like that.\u2019\u201d\nThey have so far succeeded; consultancy firm Ernst & Young recently crowned London the \"Fintech Capital\u00a0of the World.\" Moreover, while British banks earned a reputation in the Bitcoin community for being notoriously against granting bank accounts to Bitcoin and other digital-currency-related businesses, that too seems to be changing. The shift in attitude may be, in part, due to PSR.\u00a0\nEchoing criticisms often expressed in the Bitcoin community, Nixon stated:\n\n\u201cThe evidence we gathered showed that wider financial crime regulations may be causing people to be overcautious about doing business with a third party.\u201d\n\nAlthough she warns that \u201cwe would need to show our teeth from time to time,\u201d she states that PSR \u201cwon\u2019t be taking direct action\u201d because PSR is aware a number of banks are \u201cplanning to start offering indirect access or expand their current services.\u201d One such bank may be Barclays which, in an unprecedented move, partnered with Circle.\n\u201cHistorically, obtaining U.K. banking has been challenging for U.K. Bitcoin companies; however recent events show that this situation is beginning to change,\u201d Obi Nwosu, managing director at Coinfloor, a British-based Bitcoin exchange, stated in an email.\nThe winds of change are, therefore, once again in the air. As more than $20 billion has been invested globally in fintech, and investment in Bitcoin companies saw its second best quarter ever in the first quarter of 2016, it is perhaps time to repeat the remarks of George Osborn, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who, in a speech in 2014 declared: \u201cWe stand at the dawn of a new era in banking.\u201d\nPhoto\u00a0MBisanz\u00a0/ Flickr(CC)", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 13}

The release deploys the first soft fork on the Bitcoin network to use the methodology outlined in BIP 9 (Version Bits), which allows multiple soft forks to take place at the same time.\nThe three BIPs (BIP 68, BIP 112\u00a0and BIP 113) included in Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 have huge implications for the Lightning Network, which many believe to be Bitcoin\u2019s best chance for long-term scalability. Although the code for the soft fork has been deployed, miners cannot signal their support for it until May 1st.\nA Huge Step Forward for the Lightning Network\nThe three BIPs implemented in this latest release of Bitcoin Core combine to enable relative locktime. This means that payment channels can now be closed without a predetermined date, which would be set when the channel is initially opened. This provides more flexibility to layer-2 initiatives, such as the Lightning Network, because users will be able to exit channels in a more timely manner.\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Bitcoin Core contributor and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo for further details on how these new changes will affect the flexibility between channels on the Lightning Network, and he said:\n\n\u201cIt depends on the locktime duration -- it\u2019s a tradeoff. Too short a time means not enough time to enforce a revocation (and steal back the funds). Too long a time and you risk waiting a while to force the channel to close if the counterparty is unresponsive.\u201d\n\nLombrozo also added, \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve settled on an optimum value.\u201d\nAccording to Lombrozo, the reliability of outsourced revocation, the number of hops between channels, and other variables must also be considered. The Ciphrex CEO added, \u201cIdeally, the locktime is never used. It\u2019s there to prevent broadcast of revoked commitments.\u201d\nIn a scenario where a user wants to close a channel and the counterparty complies, Lombrozo claims the channel can essentially be closed in the next block.\nBlock Space More About Users Than Transactions?\nOne of the key points that Lightning Network co-creator Joseph Poon has made lately (along with co-creator\u00a0Tadge Dryja) is that his\u00a0generalized network for payment channels turns the block size limit into an issue of users rather than transactions. This is because bidirectional payment channels with relative locktimes can theoretically stay open forever.\nWhile it\u2019s unclear what percentage of Bitcoin users will want to use the Lightning Network for the vast majority of their transactions, it\u2019s clear to see that this system requires block space for opening and closing channels rather than actual transactions. Although, it should be noted that a user can also send funds in a transaction that is meant to close a channel.\nIf everyone were using the Lightning Network, the block size limit would be a limit on the number of users who can open channels with other users. Having said that, this scenario is unlikely as there are still reasons to use the underlying Bitcoin blockchain for reasons other than opening or closing a payment channel.\nMultiple Soft Forks at the Same Time\nThe soft fork rolled out in Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 will also not delay the deployment of Segregated Witness because Version Bits was used to implement these new features. Version Bits has implications for the pace at which scalability solutions can be added to Bitcoin, and it also enables a warning system to alert older nodes when new rules are going to be activated. The new rules become active when 95 percent of miners have upgraded to the new version of Bitcoin Core.\n\u00a0\nThank you to Bitcoin Core contributor and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo for providing technical details and feedback for this article.\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

While no official announcement about this move has been made, OpenBazaar developer Chris Pacia, who is currently working on the IPFS integration, has shared some of the details related to this change with Bitcoin Magazine.\nAccording to Pacia, the main advantage of integrating IPFS into OpenBazaar will be the increased availability of storefronts. Currently, a store operator must maintain his or her own server at all times or pay someone else to do it.\nWhat Is IPFS?\nIPFS is a hypermedia distribution protocol that enables the creation of distributed applications. The team behind IPFS is creating a peer-to-peer file system that can be accessed by all of the computing devices in the world. The brains behind this new protocol, Stanford graduate\u00a0 Juan Benet, has said\u00a0that IPFS allows people to create websites and web apps with no central server. He added, \u201cThey can be distributed just like the Bitcoin network is distributed.\u201d\nWhat Are the Advantages of IPFS for OpenBazaar?\nSince OpenBazaar is a marketplace with no central server, IPFS appears to be a solid option for hosting storefronts.\nPacia agrees with this sentiment. He told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cThe main advantage is data will become more distributed and most of it should be viewable even if the originating node is offline.\u201d\nPacia went on to describe the current issues with OpenBazaar when it comes to opening and operating a store on the network:\n\u201cWe have a situation now where you have to fetch store data from only one person, and if they have a slow or buggy connection (or if they get attacked), then you can't access that data, despite potentially hundreds of other users having that data from a previous download.\u201d\nEssentially, IPFS will allow OpenBazaar users to connect to specific stores via many other peers who already have that data rather than just the owner of the store.\nPacia continued:\n\u201cSo IPFS seeds everything you download which makes the data much more permanent. It also provides a more robust DHT implementation than what we have written, and it's better to spend our resources collaborating than trying to maintain our own.\u201d\nMany early users of OpenBazaar have complained about having to operate a server 24/7 to keep their stores \u201copen\u201d on the network, which is why the removal of this requirement has been a top priority for the development team behind the project.\nLayering Anonymity on Top\nOther commentators have wondered whether Freenet may be the best option for OpenBazaar, but it appears the network\u2019s developers have no intention of going in that direction at this time. Pacia noted, \u201cI don't know [enough] about Freenet to comment on it. But what attracts us to IPFS is its scalable approach to data replication.\u201d\nAlthough OpenBazaar launched without native support for anonymizing networks\u00a0such as i2p or Tor, OpenBazaar project lead Brian Hoffman recently reiterated the development team\u2019s dedication to privacy.\n\u201cAnonymity can be layered on top of [IPFS],\u201d Pacia told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cIt won't be too much work to enable onion nodes to connect to each other.\u201d\nOpenBazaar\u2019s support for IPFS is not strictly theoretical, as code related to this change is already available on GitHub.\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

However, he told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine, \"I think everyone who actually attended the meeting would disagree with what was stated in the article [posted below].\"\nBitcoin Classic is the latest attempt to increase Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit via a hard fork initiated by miners running an alternative to Bitcoin Core, but it appears that the relatively new software client may already be on its last legs. According to various sources familiar with a meeting in Beijing on March 30, supporters of an increase to the Bitcoin block size limit were unable to convince the Chinese mining community to implement BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) 109 without support from Bitcoin Core contributors.\nBitcoin Core Supporters Not Invited\nIt was the intention of some participants to convince the Chinese mining community to adopt BIP 109 without the blessing of Bitcoin Core, which would, with support from 75 percent of the network hashrate, lead to an increase in the block size limit to 2 megabytes via a hard fork. The supporters of an increase in the block size limit also discussed a possible crisis that could ensue if the limit was not raised before the upcoming block reward halving.\nBitfury CIO Alex Petrov and others (who preferred to remain anonymous) have confirmed that anyone perceived to be associated with Bitcoin Core was not invited to the meeting. This includes Bitcoin Core contributors and various supporters of the Bitcoin Core roadmap. For example, Petrov was explicitly told that he was not allowed to enter the venue where the meeting was held until the discussions were over.\nThis is a similar setup to the meeting that took place in Hong Kong earlier this year between supporters of the Bitcoin Core roadmap and the Chinese mining community, although BTCC COO Samson Mow, who put that meeting together, told Bitcoin Magazine that FinalHash CTO Marshall Long was the only individual who was specifically not wanted at that event. Having said that, Bitcoin Classic supporter Peter Ng did attend the Hong Kong meeting.\nChinese Miners Prefer to Fork with Bitcoin Core\nThe details of exactly what was said during the meeting are still relatively unknown to outsiders at this point, but sources claim that one end result of the event is clear: Representatives of the Chinese mining community have no intention of deviating from the previous agreement made in Hong Kong as long as Bitcoin Core continues to implement improvements for scaling. Mow, who has spoken with multiple individuals who attended the meeting, told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n\u201cBasically, [the BIP 109 delegation] came over with an arrogant attitude and tried to dictate who could and could not attend. They were not able to present a convincing argument, and the general vibe is that they\u2019re going nowhere. \u2018Train wreck\u2019 would be a suitable term to describe their efforts in Beijing.\u201d\n\nMow added, \u201cThis is based on multiple sources, and my opinion is that it is generally known [among Bitcoin miners and companies in China].\u201d\nIn addition to Bitcoin industry executives, such as the CEOs of Blockchain and Coinbase, at least one developer attempted to convince miners to increase the block size limit via BIP 109. According to sources, that developer was Gavin Andresen, who authored the improvement proposal.\nThere are also rumors that miners may have been offered extra money to abandon Bitcoin Core for Bitcoin Classic. According to an anonymous source who was at the meeting, money was discussed, but it was in the context of protecting the network after a hypothetical hard fork had been activated. Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd recently claimed these sorts of discussions have happened in the past. Andresen responded to Todd\u2019s statement on Reddit. He commented:\n\n\u201cThat is the way Bitcoin consensus works. Majority hashpower wins, unless they try to force through a change that is rejected by majority economic power (exchanges, merchants, users). The block size limit is a change that the economic majority has been SCREAMING FOR for a long time.\u201d\n\nWhat Happens Next?\nSince the vast majority of hashing power would like to honor the previous Hong Kong agreement and stick with Bitcoin Core, it appears that the only hard fork in Bitcoin\u2019s near future is going to come from Bitcoin Core developers. Bitcoin Core contributors have been able to stick to their December roadmap, and new improvements have been released in a timely manner. At this point, a change to another, hard-fork-inducing software client seems unlikely.\nFor the supporters of larger blocks, the goal is to get an increase in the block size limit before the upcoming halving in an effort to avoid a possible \u201cdoomsday scenario.\u201d Whether this goal will be achieved remains unclear.\nSupport for Bitcoin Classic stood at roughly 5 percent of the network hashrate at the time this article was published.\n\u00a0\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nOver the past year or two, the main topic of conversation in the Bitcoin community has been how the system is going to eventually scale to millions or billions of users. Two concepts often brought up during these sorts of discussions are the Lightning Network and sidechains.\nBlockstream is in a unique position when it comes to these Bitcoin improvements, as it has the funds and incentives to work on both of these concepts simultaneously. In a recent interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell shared his views on sidechains as a scalability solution and why the Lightning Network will be a better option over the long term.\nImplementing Bitcoin Classic as a Sidechain\nSome members of the Bitcoin community have wondered whether it would be a good idea to implement changes to Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit via a sidechain. In fact, one of the key points made by Bitcoin Hivemind\u2019s Paul Sztorc in his drivechain proposal was that sidechains would allow Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin XT to be implemented via this technology.\nWhile Maxwell agreed that this sort of functionality is possible, he didn\u2019t seem convinced that it would be of much use. He explained:\n\n\u201cOur greatest motivation for the sidechain concept in Bitcoin was being able to better satisfy mutually exclusive objectives for the system. However, sidechains by themselves do not fundamentally change the scaling limitations of a global broadcast system, though they should provide security partitioning if an experimental chain should fail.\u201d\n\nIn other words, splitting sections of the network onto various sidechains does not necessarily mean that Bitcoin can then scale to an infinitely larger number of transactions per second.\nThe Lightning Network as a Better Option\nWhile many believe sidechains could be Bitcoin\u2019s long-term solution to the scalability issue, Maxwell sees the Lightning Network as a better option. This is the exact opposite opinion recently shared by Bitcoin Core contributor and Bloq CEO Jeff Garzik on a recent episode of Bitcoin Uncensored.\nGarzik is a fan of the Lightning Network concept, but he still thinks there are too many unanswered questions associated with it for it to be viewed as Bitcoin\u2019s one, true solution to scaling. It should be noted that Garzik admits these sorts of issues also exist for sidechains.\nIn terms of a sidechain\u2019s ability to help Bitcoin scale, Maxwell told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cIt may be technically possible to have a low-value, low-assurance and more micropayments-focused sidechain, within limits.\u201d\nHe then clarified, \u201cHowever, Lightning, once at release stage, offers a more compelling scaling solution that can really position the Bitcoin ecosystem for large-scale Bitcoin retail use and new, higher-scale micropayments use cases.\u201d\nBitcoin Core contributor and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo discussed some of the micropayments-related use cases of the Lightning Network at Blockchain Agenda San Diego late last year. Some of the use cases mentioned by Lombrozo included: lower-cost paywalls, Joystream (a BitTorrent client that incentivizes seeders with bitcoins), decentralized exchanges and peer-to-peer bandwidth sales.\nMany People are Working on the Lightning Network\nMuch like sidechains, many companies and individuals are working on bringing a useful version of the Lightning Network to Bitcoin.\u00a0\nMaxwell noted, \u201cAt least five companies as well as many individuals are actively developing Lightning, and much of the code and development is open in a similar model to Bitcoin.\u201d\nRusty Russell, who previously worked on the network subsystem for the Linux kernel, is developing an implementation of the Lightning Network at Blockstream, and the original co-creators of the concept, Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja, are also working on their own version of the layer-2 protocol for Bitcoin. Poon recently let it be known that he expects a functional version of his and Dryja\u2019s Lightning Network to be available this summer, while Russell is less certain his implementation will be made available by that time.\nAmiko Pay and Stroem are two other projects similar to the Lightning Network that are currently in various stages of development.\n\u00a0\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

Dilley shared his views on the future of Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit, and explained why he\u2019s not worried that a solution has yet to be chosen. Dilley\u2019s calm demeanor in regard to the block size issue seems to be partially based on his excitement over various improvements that are making their way to Bitcoin via soft forks.\nThat a Hard Fork Hasn\u2019t Happened Is Bullish for Bitcoin\nWhen asked about the lack of a hard fork to a larger block size limit up to this point, Dilley said that nothing is likely to change over the short term. He explained:\n\n\u201cI think, today, we\u2019re still no closer to any short-term movement (six months to a year) on the block size issue. That just has to do with the fact that driving consensus in a system that\u2019s designed to not force anyone to do anything is difficult \u2012 and that\u2019s actually a good thing.\u201d\n\nDilley expounded on his view, which has been also been expressed by Bitcoin Core contributor Cory Fields and others, that the difficulties with coming to consensus on changes in Bitcoin is a good thing. The former member of the Pantera Capital team stated:\n\n\u201cThe fact that there is considerable tension and the fact that a hard fork hasn\u2019t happened is actually the most-encouraging, most-bullish sign for Bitcoin that there\u2019s been in two years. It means that the system works. The fact that it\u2019s difficult to make controversial changes to Bitcoin is a really good sign. It means it\u2019s very resilient to attempts to overturn outstanding or current governance status.\u201d\n\nDilley added a disclaimer to his bullish tone, stating, \u201cTo be clear, I\u2019m the most bullish Bitcoiner I know.\u201d\nNo One Entity Has Control Over the Block Size Limit\nIn terms of what kind of change will eventually be seen in Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit, Dilley said, \u201cWe will get to some sort of adaptive block size solution.\u201d\nBitPay co-founder and CEO Stephen Pair\u2019s simple, adaptive block size limit is the one flexible solution that has garnered the most attention up to this point; however, many similar proposals have been made over the years.\nIn terms of how a final decision will be made, Dilley added, \u201cI don\u2019t think any individual or institution really has any control over what that final state looks like.\u201d\nAlthough Bitcoin has not hard forked to a larger block size yet, much of the community, including Dilley, is encouraged by the various improvements, such as CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY and Segregated Witness, that are currently being tested and rolled out onto the network.\nExcitement for BIP 9, Also Known as Version Bits\nDilley mentioned a variety of improvements that are coming to Bitcoin, but he seemed most excited about BIP 9 (Version Bits), which was recently used for the first time in the release of Bitcoin Core 0.12.1. This is a change to the way in which soft forks are rolled out, and it will allow many soft forks to be deployed at the same time.\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be a massive and strict improvement for Bitcoin\u2019s ability to get multiple things in flight at once,\u201d Dilley said.\nIn terms of how upgrades have been made in the past, Dilley added, \u201cThis sequential methodology that we\u2019ve been working off of has actually slowed our ability to roll out the types and kinds of things that Bitcoin needs to really thrive.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

But Chris Dodd, chief of the MPAA, said that if the issue of piracy could be tackled it would add a healthy $1.5 billion more to the movie industry\u2019s bottom line.\nBut currently available piracy detection technologies are ineffective in tackling digital media piracy because most illegal downloads happen on peer-to-peer networks.\nCustos Media Technologies, a startup based in Stellenbosch, South Africa, recently unveiled a \u00a0technology that uses Bitcoin to track pirated media.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Fred Lutz, chief operating officer at Custos, said that the process basically involves embedding an invisible and difficult-to-remove watermark into the digital content, the watermark in this case being a Bitcoin private key. If the watermarked content is then leaked there is a small Bitcoin reward that can be collected by the first person to find it.\n\u201cThe code that we embed throughout the movie is a Bitcoin private key, and we top-up the associated account with some bitcoins,\u201d Lutz said. \u201cWe have a tool available publicly at Privateer.xyz with which anyone can read the watermark and extract the bitcoins. This means that a movie or ebook that goes out of the control of the intended recipient now has some vulnerability \u2012 if it lands in the wild, the bitcoins will be extracted and we are notified through the blockchain that the funds were moved. We notify our clients of the identity of the customer that is associated with the private key and they can respond accordingly.\u201d\nAccording to Lutz, Custos is a spinout from research done by him and his partners; G-J van Rooyen, and Herman Engelbrech, at the Media Lab at Stellenbosch University.\nLutz said that the initial seed funding for Custos came from Innovus, the Technology Transfer Office of Stellenbosch University, in the form of a $140,000 USD prize from the SeedStars World\u00a0competition last year.\nLutz said Custos generated $265,000 USD in the second round of the seed funding, part of which came from a local angel investor and the rest from New York-based Digital Currency Group.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are very fortunate to have investors that believe in the team, and see the potential of this new approach to content distribution,\u201d Lutz said.\u00a0\nBesides their anti-piracy solution, Custos Media Technology also offers a screener distribution platform, Screenercopy.com, that lets filmmakers distribute pre-release movies to reviewers or the media without having to worry about piracy leaks. They also offer ebook protection services in partnership with Erudition Digital.", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 19}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nAlthough one may assume that the demand for privacy in Bitcoin and other blockchain-based systems is coming from crypto-anarchists and libertarians, the reality is that a huge push for concealing transactions on the blockchain is coming from the traditional financial industry.\u00a0\nDuring a recent cryptocurrency event at the Cato Institute, Zcash CEO and longtime cypherpunk Zooko Wilcox-O\u2019Hearn made the point that banks, clearinghouses, payment processors and everyone else he\u2019s talked to in the financial industry are the ones who are asking for more privacy on the blockchain.\nFinancial Industry Willing to Help Bring Privacy to Blockchains\nDuring a panel focused on financial privacy at the recent Cato event, Zooko made it clear that the vast majority of the push for enhanced privacy on the blockchain is coming from banks, but this was not a dismissal of the push for privacy coming from users. Zooko claimed that the increase in privacy solutions for blockchain technologies over the past six to 12 months is a reaction to the demand coming from various financial institutions.\n\u201cThere is a lot of demand among users, but I don\u2019t know how much they\u2019re willing to stump up. Whereas the financial industry appears [ready to do so],\u201d Zooko said.\nWhy Is the Financial Industry Demanding Privacy?\nZooko pointed to two main reasons that banks and other financial institutions need privacy for any blockchain they\u2019re going to use:\n\nBanks are thinking about using blockchains to lower their costs, but they also understand that this technology could disrupt their industry. The idea of saving money is obviously attractive, but the disruptive properties of public ledgers are forcing financial services companies to pay close attention to the blockchain ecosystem.\nFinancial institutions understand that the pervasive lack of privacy in shared ledgers is a roadblock for the use of blockchains in their industry.\n\nIn Zooko\u2019s view, all of the use cases that make sense for the financial industry, such as trading and settlement, require flexible layers of privacy that allow specific individuals or organizations to have access to data related to each transaction.\n\n\u201cFor both regulatory and business reasons, if you\u2019re going to have a shared database of financial information, there is no use case that I\u2019ve found yet where it\u2019s OK for everyone who accesses the database to be able to read all of the financial information in the database.\u201d\n\nRemoving Read-Access from the Blockchain\nZooko also noted that the true innovation of Bitcoin was the way it altered how read-and-write-access works for financial ledgers. He explained:\n\n\u201cBitcoin was really innovative because it made write-access cryptographic instead of centralized \u2012 that\u2019s basically the most important thing about Bitcoin. At the same time, it made read-access ubiquitous \u2012 everyone can read everything all the time. So this next step that we\u2019re on the cusp of is making read-access cryptographic ... and that appears to be necessary for the applications of blockchains to all of these different [companies in the] financial industry.\u201d\n\nZooko added that his own company\u2019s Zerocash-based blockchain will allow the creator of a transaction to choose who else can see the details of that transaction on the public ledger. Confidential Transactions and Enigma were two other privacy-focused blockchain improvements mentioned by Zooko at the event.\n\u00a0\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

ChangeTip went viral soon after launch and was considered a Bitcoin killer app, which allowed the company to raise $3.5 million in venture capital in 2014. However, the company continued to struggle and, according to the sources mentioned by Quartz, had to put its intellectual property and software up for sale.\n\"We are thrilled to bring some members of the ChangeTip team on as a part of Airbnb and joining the engineering team working on building our infrastructure,\u201d an Airbnb spokesperson told International Business Times. \"We are not acquiring the assets of the company, nor do we have any plans to incorporate Bitcoin into the Airbnb ecosystem.\"\nAirbnb, founded in August 2008 and headquartered in San Francisco, is a peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace for temporary lodging that connects hosts and customers all over the world. The service is especially popular with cost-conscious tourists or visitors who need accommodation for a brief stay. In 2015, Airbnb raised $1.5 billion in funding led by growth equity firm General Atlantic. Airbnb\u2019s business model, based on collecting fees from hosts, is similar to Uber\u2019s.\nThe \u201cpeople as a service\u201d business model of Uber and Airbnb has proved disruptive and spectacularly successful with providers and consumers alike, and threatened established service providers such as hotels and taxi companies. Despite the many regulatory attacks based, for example, on the employment status of Uber drivers and Airbnb hosts, it seems consumers want services like Uber and Airbnb, which, therefore, are likely to continue growing.\nThe official Airbnb statement seems to mean that Airbnb has no immediate plans to accept Bitcoin payments, which seems plausible since the company is often under regulatory fire for other reasons and, therefore, probably wants to keep things quiet on this front.\nHowever, Airbnb has reasons to be interested in the blockchain technology upon which the Bitcoin network is based.\u00a0\n\u201cI think that, within the context of Airbnb, your reputation is everything, and I can see it being even more so in the future, whereby you might need a certain reputation [in] order to have access to certain types of homes,\u201d said Airbnb co-founder Nathan Blecharczyk in a recent interview with CityAM, in response to a question about Airbnb\u2019s eventual plans to use distributed ledger technology to build trust in its network.\n\u201cBut then the question is whether there\u2019s a way to export that and allow access elsewhere to help other sharing economy models really flourish,\u201d said Blecharczyk. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for all different kinds of signals to tell us whether someone is reputable, and I could certainly see some of these more novel types of signals being plugged into our engine.\u201d\nThat seems to indicate that Airbnb is looking beyond Bitcoin payment and hiring blockchain talent to prepare for next-generation applications of distributed ledgers, such as reputation systems and smart contracts. These \u201cBitcoin 2.0\u201d applications are critical to \u201cpeople as a service\u201d business models such as those of Airbnb and Uber, centered on reputation and automatically executing agreements.\nIn November, Bitcoin Magazine reported that Slock, a German startup specializing in blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, will sell smart locks linked to the Ethereum blockchain, which can be unlocked automatically on payment for a rental car or house. Smart-lock technology could decentralize the sharing economy, empowering anyone to easily rent, share or sell anything that can be locked, which means disrupting the disruptors, including companies such as Airbnb and other intermediaries based around some form of physical access.\u00a0\n\u201cI use [Uber and Airbnb] and appreciate the progress they are making in bringing awareness to the sharing economy, but I would prefer a system that would allow me to deal directly with the owner without any third parties skimming off the top,\u201d said Slock\u2019s co-founder Christoph Jentzsch.\u00a0\nInternational Business Times mentions speculation that Airbnb\u2019s interest in blockchain technology could have been stimulated by Slock\u2019s automated lock technology. It seems likely that Airbnb will consider blockchain-based plans to continue as one of the disruptors \u2012 instead of becoming one of the disrupted.", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 19}

Their crucial role in clearing, processing and creating money, the financial lifeblood of the economy, ensures efficient trade between specialized producers or service providers. Their failure to perform such a role would trigger national and global crisis, if not devastation.\nThe most recent example of such failure is the bankruptcy of Lehman\u00a0Brothers in 2008 which triggered a chain of events culminating in some tense 48 hours when nations were \u201con the brink of catastrophe,\u201d according to Hank Paulson, then treasury secretary, to such extent that \u201cthe former head of Goldman Sachs got down on one knee and begged [then-House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi\u201d to support the $700 billion bank bailout known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Meanwhile, Britain was \u201chours from collapse,\u201d according to then-Chancellor Alistair Darling.\nThe effects of those fateful days are still reverberating. The cost to the United States is estimated in trillions, according to the U.S. Governmental Accountability Office. Directly or indirectly, the crises led to activist uprisings from both the left in Occupy Wall Street and the right in the Tea Party Movement \u2013 as well as riots in London in 2011.\u00a0\nIf the West was hurting, the rest of the world was on edge to the point where revolution was underway in the Middle East and North Africa. That revolution, in parts of the world, turned to devastating war. The contagion spread to Europe, which at one point risked full collapse with vultures circling Italy, Spain and even France. Detroit went bankrupt. Greece, in an ongoing drama, was bailed out.\nEveryone would like to prevent such systemic failures, that have sent some nations into \u00a0deep recession and others into depression. While Occupy Wall Street pointed a finger at the \u201cone percent,\u201d the Tea Party blamed the government and the Financial\u00a0Crisis Inquiry Commission blamed everyone. It concluded that there were \u201cwidespread failures in financial regulation,\u201d a \u201clack of transparency\u201d with the up-to-the-hilt leverage \u201coften hidden,\u201d and there was \u201ca systemic breakdown in accountability and ethics,\u201d among other causes.\nHow the Monetary System Currently Operates\nAn often overlooked contributor to the crisis is the payment and monetary system itself, which is currently centralized into a few gigantic interconnected institutions that take on all risk to the point where they are now considered \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d In a recent report, the Bank\u00a0of England explained that these institutions create money \u201cat the stroke of bankers\u2019 pens when they approve loans.\u201d\n\n\u201cCommercial banks create money, in the form of bank deposits, by making new loans. When a bank makes a loan, for example to someone taking out a mortgage to buy a house, it does not typically do so by giving them thousands of pounds worth of banknotes. Instead, it credits their bank account with a bank deposit of the size of the mortgage. At that moment, new money is created.\u201d\n\nMoney is then destroyed when the loan is repaid, with the interest paid on the loan going toward the bank\u2019s profits.\nThe report lists a number of constraints on banks\u2019 ability to create money, such as demand for new loans, the interest rate set by central banks and risk of default. However, it acknowledges risk can be misjudged and such misjudgement \u201cis sometimes argued to be one of the reasons why bank lending expanded so much in the lead up to the financial crisis.\u201d\nThe report further states the interest rate is set by demand for central bank IOUs, rather than the other way around. Currently, such demand is almost non-existent. Therefore, central banks are, in effect, creating new reserve currency to keep inflation at 2 percent and encourage spending.\nArguably, as banks profit from new loans through interest, they are incentivized to create more and more money. Standards slowly relax, interbank competition kicks in, underwriting rules are ignored, complex instruments are created to both manage and hide risk, boom times arrive, while politicians take credit and assure everyone that there will be \u201cno return to boom and bust,\u201d as Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer for almost a decade, stated in 2006. The biggest boom and bust in living memory followed.\nHow the Current Payment System Works\nCurrently, most payments go through a centralized clearinghouse. The system itself is highly complex with many interconnections between clearinghouses, but in its simple form, when banks settle accounts between themselves, they rarely do so directly. They instead use a Central Counterparty Clearing (CCP) arrangement.\u00a0\nAccording to a report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago:\n\n\u201cThrough novation, the original contract between the buyer and seller is extinguished and replaced by two new contracts, one between the CCP and the buyer, and the other between the CCP and the seller.\u201d\n\nOtherwise stated, a clearinghouse acts as a \u201cbuyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer,\u201d in the process taking on the risk of default by the buyer or the seller, which it can cover through margin requirements and other collateralization. For the service, of course, it charges fees or interest.\nAccording to the report, clearinghouses \u201ccan be sources of financial shocks, such as liquidity dislocations and credit losses, or a major channel through which these shocks are transmitted across domestic and international financial markets.\u201d\nAccording to a speech by former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke\u00a0at the 2011 Financial Markets Conference regarding the 1987 stock market crash:\n\n\u201cSurging volumes of trades and extraordinary price volatility during the week of October 19th created errors and delays in confirming stock trades, severe operational and financial stress at clearing members, and heavy liquidity demands throughout the financial markets. In the derivatives markets, multiple intraday margin calls were made to protect the clearinghouses, but banks sometimes delayed making key payments to and from the clearinghouses, adding to the uncertainty. Meanwhile, the clearinghouses themselves apparently absorbed significant amounts of intraday liquidity from the markets by collecting, but not always paying out, so-called variation margin \u2012 payments that investors were required to make as the values of their holdings plunged.\n\nIn reviewing the episode, the Brady Commission noted that although the clearinghouse system avoided defaults, investor uncertainties about the viability of the clearinghouses, as well as about the ability of major broker-dealers to meet their obligations, intensified market fluctuations and panic.\u201d\nConcerns have been raised that far too much risk is placed on the clearinghouses which manage hundreds of trillions of dollars.\n\"What happens if they go bust? I can tell you the simple answer: mayhem. As bad as, conceivably worse than, the failure of large and complex banks,\" Paul Tucker, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, said in October. The Economist says that a regulator privately described them as \u201ctoo big to fail, on steroids.\u201d\nSometimes they do fully crash\u00a0for a short period. The worry, however, is failure to manage risk which may lead to a counterparty default, forcing CCPs to dip into their reserves. If they are unable to meet their obligations then the risk passes on to banks. Depending on the magnitude, it could be trillions of dollars and a collapse too big to bail.\nEnter Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology\n\u201cWhen everything else is stripped away, the most pressing issue is the management of risk.\u201d \u2012 from the 1987 crash report of the Hong Kong Securities Review Committee.\nAlthough many have tried to impose their utopian ideologies on Bitcoin, in its foundation the technology is rather dull and boring. It concerns not governments or banks, but risk and risk management. Instead of having a counterparty or an intermediary, Bitcoin allows direct payment in an unforgeable, immutable trivially verifiable way.\nBitcoin not only minimizes risk, but eliminates it altogether. It has an inbuilt clearinghouse through the use of mathematical proofs which allow transactions to be chained to one another in a blockchain in such a way as to make fabrication of a bitcoin or Bitcoin transaction impossible. Accounting, therefore, is simplified. Transactions are as good as instant. Complexity is almost non-existent. It takes the whole monetary and payment structure and simplifies it in such an outside-the-box way that it makes one wonder why on earth we did not think of that before.\nIn a recent editorial, CFTC Commissioner J. Christopher Giancarlo, calling on regulators to employ a \u201cdo no harm\u201d approach, highlights the inefficiencies of the current system by going back to those fateful days:\n\n\u201cTrading conditions were deteriorating by the minute. It was clear that the regulator had little means, short of telephone calls, to read all the danger signals the market was broadcasting.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s global ledger is pseudo-anonymous. That is, it can be as private or as transparent as one desires. It keeps a record of all transactions for eternity, but whether that transaction is attributable to an entity depends on the entity itself. If one does not reveal ownership of a Bitcoin address, it is difficult to attribute ownership. If, however, one does reveal it, a historical record is kept forever, thus making it difficult, if at all possible, to hide or fabricate the past. While in 2008 institutions lost track of who owns what, thus creating mistrust and a freezing of interbank transfers, in Bitcoin it is quite easy to prove ownership if so desired.\u00a0\nOf course, the technology itself is not without problems and, unlike the claims of some, it is not a solution to complex issues of governance or lending; it is simply a technology which allows for value transfer in such a way that risk is minimized, if not fully eliminated. While some of its implications are as far-reaching, if not more so, than the Internet itself in democratizing finance, the invention is an incremental improvement and a product of decades of research.\nFrom a technological point of view, Bitcoin is the most exciting invention since the Internet. While previously the smartest brains on the planet where focusing on creating yet another cat picture-sharing app, now they are working on more efficient, more secure, less risky value transfer and, in the process, improving trade and increasing wealth.\nFrom smart contracts to the Internet of Things, an era of automation in finance is underway. This new technology brings to the world a 21st century financial system where money is simply permissionless information which can travel at the speed of light from London to New York and Shanghai.\nIt took seven years, but the regulators and the CEOs have now seen what some parts of the community hid under their utopian rhetoric. A world race is underway to catch the low- hanging fruit and become, perhaps, the first trillion-dollar company with savings in billions promised and new opportunities opened.\n\u00a0\nSources:\nhttps://next.ft.com/content/8090cc80-fff6-11e5-99cb-83242733f755\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/20/bank-of-england-payment-system-crashes\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/clearing-default-idUSL6E8CD4AL20120116\nhttp://www.economist.com/node/21552209\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20110404a.htm\nhttp://chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/understanding_derivatives/understanding_derivatives_chapter_2_central_counterparty_clearing.pdf\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OU_fzCpwrNc\nhttp://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/quarterlybulletin/2014/qb14q1prereleasemoneycreation.pdf\nhttp://fcic-static.law.stanford.edu/cdn_media/fcic-reports/fcic_final_report_conclusions.pdf\nhttp://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-13-180\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/27/wallstreet.useconomy1\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_8914000/8914062.stm\nhttp://fortune.com/2013/08/28/hank-paulson-why-fannie-and-freddie-remain-a-big-threat/\u00a0\nhttp://www.sfc.hk/sfc/doc/EN/speeches/public/consult/Report-Operation_and_Regulation_HK_Industry.pdf\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 20}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nSegregated Witness might be the most significant improvement to the Bitcoin protocol to date. The innovation is set to fix transaction malleability, offers an effective block size increase, enables development flexibility and more. After months of coding, Segregated Witness is getting close to rollout, as a pull request was submitted to Bitcoin Core earlier this week.\nHow close to roll-out exactly? As with any change to the Bitcoin protocol, that is hard to predict.\nA Segregated Witness timeline ...\nStep One: The Idea\nEach improvement to the Bitcoin protocol starts with an idea.\nThe Segregated Witness idea goes back a long time; the general concept to separate transaction and signature data probably originated in 2014, or perhaps even sooner. But it was about a year ago, early 2015, that Blockstream\u2019s Bitcoin and sidechain development team decided to implement the concept in their prototype sidechain:\u00a0Elements. Elements, which includes Segregated Witness, was mostly designed by Bitcoin Core developer and Blockstream co-founder Gregory Maxwell and released in June 2015.\nAt that point it was still thought impossible to implement Segregated Witness on the Bitcoin blockchain, however, unless it was through a hard fork. Separating transaction and signature data would incompatibly change the structure blocks, which could cause a split in the Bitcoin network between upgraded nodes and non-upgraded nodes.\nIn the autumn of 2015, it was Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr who figured out how to implement Segregated Witness in the main Bitcoin protocol, after all. Using a clever hack, Segregated Witness transactions can be marked as \u201canyone-can-spend\u201d transactions for non-upgraded nodes, while upgraded nodes are redirected to an \u201cadd-on block\u201d with signature data. This solves the incompatibility issue, meaning Segregated Witness can be rolled out as a soft fork.\nThis option was first discussed among Bitcoin Core developers through typical communication channels: by private email, on IRC, a little later on the Bitcoin development mailing list and elsewhere. Everyone involved in the conversation agreed it was a good idea.\nA couple of weeks later, in December 2015, Segregated Witness was publicly presented by Bitcoin Core developer Pieter Wuille at the Scaling Bitcoin workshop Hong Kong.\nEstimated time: 1 year\nStep Two: The Code\nAn idea in itself doesn't change anything. Someone needs to write the code to realize the idea.\nWuille began coding Segregated Witness in November 2015 \u2013 a couple of weeks before he presented the idea in Hong Kong. Excited by the potential, Bitcoin Core developer and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo, Bitcoin Core developer Johnson Lau and some other developers started contributing as well.\nFive months later, Segregated Witness for Bitcoin Core counts 4,743 lines of code (including test code), and proposes to remove or modify 554 of existing lines of Bitcoin Core code. Wuille and the other contributors consider it done.\nTotal time: +-5 months\nStep Three: The Review\nAs the code is considered completed, Wuille submitted a pull request this week. A pull request is basically an \u201cofficial\u201d proposal on development platform GitHub to merge a batch of code \u2013 Segregated Witness \u2013 into Bitcoin Core's master branch: the continually evolving heart of the project on which new Bitcoin Core releases are based.\nThis marks the start of the technical review process. Other developers are invited to review and test the code, and offer their opinion. This can be done in the form of a comment, or through a type of vote: \u201cACKs\u201d (in favor) and \u201cNACKs\u201d (against). There are also several subdivisions of ACKs and NACKs, for instance to indicate that the code has been tested by that developer \u2013 or not.\nThe review process will take as long as the Bitcoin Core repository maintainer \u2013 currently Wladimir van der Laan \u2013 considers necessary. If he believes rough consensus for a merge is (and will remain) absent, he can close the pull request. The proposal is rejected, and the submitter can opt to re-write the code.\nMore likely, in the case of Segregated Witness, the review process will provide feedback to Wuille and the other developers, which could lead to slight changes to the code.\nAnd if Van der Laan at some point believes there is rough consensus for a merge, he will merge the pull request. Segregated Witness then becomes part of Bitcoin Core\u2019s master branch.\nIn the case of Segregated Witness, it's hard to say how long it will take for the pull request to be merged. However, since it is a big change, the process will take several weeks to a month, or perhaps a bit longer.\nEstimated time: 2 to 6 weeks\nStep Four: The Release\nOnce the pull request is merged into Bitcoin Core's master branch, it will need to be offered to the public through a new Bitcoin Core release.\nBitcoin Core offers two types of releases: major releases (which typically change the second number in the release version, like 0.10.0, 0.11.0, 0.12.0, etc.) and minor releases (changes the last number, like 0.12.1, 0.12.2, etc.). Major releases are scheduled about twice per year, but usually don\u2019t include any proposed soft forks. This is so anyone can adopt the perks of a new major release, even if they don't want to upgrade to the proposed soft fork.\u00a0\nMinor releases are offered whenever code for a proposed soft fork (or bug fix) is merged, and Van der Laan believes there is rough consensus for a release. (This is normally discussed during weekly IRC meetings.)\nAll releases \u2013 major and minor \u2013 are first tagged as \u201crelease candidate.\u201d A release candidate is a proposed release, which is first publicly offered for testing. If any bugs or other problems are found in the release candidate, a new release candidate is created and publicly offered for testing as well.\u00a0\nAdditionally, all releases - major and minor, as well as release candidates - go though a technical building and signing ritual (\u201cgitian building\u201d) conducted by several developers. This is done for security and quility purposes, and can take up to several days.\nIf after about a week no problems are reported in the latest release candidate, Van der Laan will announce that this release candidate is now the actual new release. This new release is distributed through bitcoincore.org and bitcoin.org.\nEstimated time: 1 week+\nStep Five: The Activation\nOnce Bitcoin 0.12.2 is released, the Bitcoin Core development team will encourage everyone to upgrade. While upgrading is optional \u2013 older nodes will remain compatible with the rest of the Bitcoin network \u2013 upgraded nodes reap the benefits of Segregated Witness and retain maximum security.\nBut if only typical users upgrade, Segregated Witness will not yet activate. Activation will require miners to upgrade. As per Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 and the adoption of version bits, soft forks happen through a new type of signaling.\nFirst, miners (or pools) running Bitcoin Core 0.12.2 (and Bitcoin implementations that merged similar code), automatically start signalling they are ready to mine Segregated Witness transactions. This happens through version bits they include in blocks they do mine that indicate what types of transactions and blocks they can mine.\u00a0\nOnce miners representing 95 percent of hash power (1,916 blocks) within a single difficulty period (2,016 blocks/about two weeks) include the right version bit, the soft fork is locked in. One difficulty period later, the soft fork is activated, meaning the remaining 5 percent of miners have about two weeks to upgrade. (If they don't upgrade, they will remain part of the Bitcoin network, but could have their blocks orphaned by other miners if they include now-invalid transactions.)\nWhether and how fast miners representing at least 95 percent of hash power will support Segregated Witness is hard to predict. As per the\u00a0Hong Kong Bitcoin Roundtable Consensus letter, a vast majority of miners by hash power pledged to adopt Segregated Witness.\u00a0\nBut even that letter did not represent 95 percent of hash power. And\u00a0slightly more than 5 percent of hash power is currently mining in favor of Bitcoin Classic; it\u2019s not clear if the competing Bitcoin Core fork will merge Segregated Witness as well. (Nor is it clear if these miners will stick with Bitcoin Classic if it doesn\u2019t merge Segregated Witness.)\nMinimum time: 4 weeks\nStep Six: The Adoption\nAfter Segregated Witness is activated on the Bitcoin network, one final step is required for users to reap the benefits: Wallet software must include the option to actually create and receive Segregated Witness transactions.\nHow long it will take for wallets to adopt depends on their developers \u2012 and on Bitcoin library developers. When Bitcoin asked wallet and library developers about this earlier this year, it seemed that most do plan to integrate Segregated Witness into their software. The pace at which this will happen might vary, however; some developers are more willing, better funded or simply more capable than others. Some made the necessary changes already and will support Segregated Witness from Day 1 of activation; others might take a bit longer.\nBut as long as there is at least one wallet offering the option, users can always switch and enjoy the benefits right away.\nEstimated time: varies\n\u00a0\nThanks to Bitcoin Core developers Eric Lombrozo and BTCDrak for feedback and technical guidance.", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 21}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nHaving been in development for more than two years, what promises to be the first proper decentralized Bitcoin exchange is set to officially launch next Wednesday.\u00a0\nBitsquare, an open source project led by the Austrian-born Manfred Karrer, allows anyone to trade Bitcoin for fiat currency as well as altcoins, without requiring a company, central intermediary or permission from anyone.\nKarrer:\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s reliance on centralized exchanges is diametrically opposed to its principles. I hope Bitsquare will solve that problem.\u201d\n\nDecentralization\nKarrer began working on Bitsquare back when Bitcoin trading was mostly centralized in one big player: Mt.Gox. But even today, long after Mt.Gox collapsed and the trading ecosystem is significantly more diverse, Karrer believes the heavy reliance on centralized exchanges is problematic.\n\u201cExchanges provide a valuable service, as they are a bridge between Bitcoin and fiat currency, which is still very much needed,\u201d Karrer explained. \u201cBut it's a double-edged sword: Virtually everyone who wants to use Bitcoin must go through these centralized and often strictly regulated companies, which makes them the effective gatekeepers of the system.\u201d\nKarrer believes this is a fundamental problem for Bitcoin. Of course, customers who store funds on these exchanges risk losing their bitcoins overnight, as Mt.Gox proved. But even if an exchange is solvent, or users don't keep their bitcoins on the exchange, there are other \u2012 potentially even bigger \u2012 problems, Karrer thinks.\n\n\u201cAML/KYC type of compliance, in combination with the transparent nature of Bitcoin's blockchain, represents a significant loss of privacy,\u201d he said. \u201cBy piecing together the data collected by these exchanges, it can become trivial to figure out how much someone earns, or saves, or spends, and often even what the money is spent on. That\u2019s not just inconvenient; it really makes Bitcoin unsuitable for all sorts of transactions \u2012 including perfectly legal ones.\u201d\n\nAnd Karrer says privacy itself might not even be the biggest problem. An even more significant issue is fungibility: the concept that one unit of a money must be interchangeable for any other unit of that money, and carry the same value.\nKarrer:\n\n\u201cExchanges and large Bitcoin companies are already applying all sorts of coin tracing techniques. As a result, some have now begun to distinguish between 'clean' bitcoins with a known history and bitcoins used for illegitimate purposes, or even with an unknown history. If customers deposit such bitcoins, some exchanges ask quite intrusive questions, or outright block accounts. Over time, this could actually make these bitcoins less valuable, as they are harder to exchange for fiat. That\u2019s a threat to Bitcoin\u2019s viability as money. Users must be able to trust that any bitcoin received as payment is as valuable as any other bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHe added:\n\n\u201cEven the most regulation-friendly Bitcoiners should be uncomfortable with this path we're on; it\u2019s ultimately bad for user adoption. And that\u2019s not even taking the added costs of this type of compliance into account. As a community, we must provide decentralized alternatives. I hope Bitsquare will be such an alternative.\u201d\n\nIn Practice\nBitsquare \u2012 in short \u2012 works as follows.\nTo start, a user must download and install the Bitsquare software on his computer.\nOnce installed and opened, the software connects to other Bitsquare users through a peer-to-peer network over Tor. All these nodes will immediately send and forward their trading offers to the newly connected user. These offers are locally accumulated into a single order book, where they are categorized and sorted by price, payment method and more.\nIf the user sees an offer he likes, he can choose to accept it. If the user doesn't see an offer he likes, he can create a new offer, which is also sent and forwarded to all nodes on the network, and appears in their order books. As long as the user (or: his Bitsquare software) is online and connected to other nodes, his offer remains visible in all order books. (But if he closes Bitsquare, the offer disappears.)\nOnce a match is made, a series of steps is set in motion, most of which are automated by the Bitsquare software.\nFirst, both parties in the deal appoint a mutually agreed on third party arbitrator \u2012 or they simply accept the arbitrator that is appointed by default. (More on arbitrators in a bit.)\nSecond, both trading partners deposit bitcoins into a newly generated 2-of-3 multi-signature (\u201cmultisig\u201d) address. Specifically, the seller deposits the bitcoins he's selling, while both trading partners include an additional security deposit. One of the keys of the multisig address is held by the buyer, one of the keys is held by the seller, and the third key is given to the arbitrator. As such, both trading partners need to agree before bitcoins can be spent from the address \u2012 or one of the trading partners requires help from the arbitrator to do so.\nBoth trading partners also pay a small trading fee to Bitsquare\u2019s stakeholders. (More on stakeholders in a bit as well.)\nThird, the buyer sends his payment to the seller, outside of Bitsquare. This can be done in a number of ways, including bank wire transfers, several payment systems and various altcoins. When done, he confirms the payment on Bitsquare. This also signs his half of a transaction from the multisig address, which pays both trading partners their share of the locked up bitcoins. (This transaction now has one of two required signatures.)\nFourth and last, the seller receives the payment, and he confirms this through Bitsquare as well. This signs his part of the transaction, meaning two of the three signatures are included. The transaction is broadcast, and both parties are paid their share from the multisig address.\nIf all goes well, the arbitrator never comes into play.\nArbitration\nIt becomes a bit more complicated when not all goes well, for instance because the buyer never sends his payment, or the seller never confirms it, either party can call the arbitrator into play.\nKarrer, explaining what the arbitration process will look like:\n\n\u201cIf a dispute arises, the arbitrator first tries to get tamper-proof evidence created through tools like\u00a0PageSigner, or perhaps a signed bank statement. If the users cannot or will not provide that, the dispute resolution process continues through more traditional methods, like ID verification and interaction over video chat.\u201d\n\nBased on the evidence provided, the arbitrator will ultimately unlock the multisig address along with the trading partner he believes was right. The two of them create a transaction to send that trading partner the bitcoins he deserves. And, as payment for his own effort, the arbitrator also gets to keep the security deposit of the party that violated the deal \u2013 if any party did.\nThese payments for dispute resolution should also serve as an incentive for Bitsquare users to step up and offer to be arbitrators for other deals \u2012 though this option will not be available right from the start.\n\u201cIn the long-run there will be a fully decentralized arbitration system, where anyone can become an arbitrator,\u201d Karrer said. \u201cTo provide sufficient security, that arbitrator needs to pay a large deposit into a multisig address controlled by the arbitrators with the highest reputation. That system requires a few months of work, and is not in place quite yet, but it\u2019s on the roadmap.\u201d\nIn the short term, therefore, Karrer takes a bit more of a pragmatic approach.\n\u201cAt first, I will be the only arbitrator,\u201d he explained. \u201cI think that makes sense, since users will already trust me to some degree as they are using software I wrote. More importantly, I have worked on this project for over two years, and I don\u2019t want it to fail, so I have most to lose if users have a bad experience. I also expect most issues in the early days to be software bugs and usability issues, so it\u2019s useful if I arbitrate these, to get direct feedback.\u201d\nTrade-offs\nCompared to a centralized exchange, Bitsquare does include several trade-offs.\nFor one, trading on Bitsquare will typically be a bit slower. Where centralized exchanges allow users to get \u201cin and out of Bitcoin\u201d in a matter of seconds, trades on Bitsquare can take a day or more for fiat to be transferred from one user to another via wire transfers. Additionally, the barrier of entry to trade on Bitsquare will also be a bit higher in some ways, as users need to download and install the software and deposit some bitcoins as security. And, of course, there is always a risk of trades going wrong, as trading partners require each other to act swiftly and honestly for a smooth experience.\nKarrer believes the trade-offs will be worth it for many users, however.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that Bitsquare is not really designed for day-traders using wire transfers. Bitsquare more closely resembles something like LocalBitcoins in that regard. But note that some payment methods are instant, or at least much faster than wire transfers, in which case trades take as little time as a blockchain confirmation. And yes, there are some barriers of entry. But on the other hand, users don\u2019t need to submit any ID-documents, there is no waiting period to be approved, or anything like that. It also removes barriers.\u201d\nAnd, addressing the risks of trading partners not acting properly:\n\u201cI believe the incentives align for everyone to be honest. The only real risk is probably fiat charge-backs due to hacked bank accounts. After a trade is closed and the bitcoins are sent to the scammer, a bank chargeback can leave the seller with nothing. To mitigate this risk, Bitsquare will limit wire transfer trades to 0.5 bitcoin for now; at such low limits Bitsquare will probably not be the preferred option for fraudsters looking to abuse hacked bank accounts. And if this type of fraud does ever become a problem, we can solve it with time-locked payout transactions, so arbitrators can step in after a fiat chargeback, if needed.\u201d\nOrganization\nOn the other hand, Bitsquare also offers several benefits compared to centralized exchanges. Most obviously, Bitsquare users do not run any risk of the exchange abusing their funds or customer data: Bitsquare holds neither. In fact, Bitsquare is not even a registered company: it doesn't have employees, and Karrer emphasizes he is not its CEO.\nKarrer:\n\n\u201cBitsquare is an open source project; that's very important from a regulatory perspective. Like Bitcoin itself, there should be no central party to shut down or pressure into compliance. Even if I personally get harassed in some way or another, Bitsquare holds no customer data or funds. And the software is open source: anyone can verify it, use it, fork it ... it's out there and cannot be shut down, not even by me.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Karrer intends to increasingly distribute control over the project. He wants Bitsquare to evolve into a DAO; a decentralized autonomous organization that will lead its own life.\n\u201cBitsquare will be owned by shareholders, that through a voting system decide on virtually all of Bitsquare\u2019s policies, including the issuance of new shares. These shareholders will also earn money from trading fees \u2011 Bitsquare\u2019s revenue source,\u201d Karrer explained.\n\n\u201cI am currently the top shareholder myself, simply by the fact that I did most of the development. But I want to decentralize this ownership by paying shares to other contributors. I really hope that Bitsquare becomes a community project much like Bitcoin itself, where over time it no longer matters who created it.\u201d\n\nFor more information on Bitsquare, visit\u00a0bitsquare.io\u00a0or read the project\u00a0white paper\u00a0for technical details. Karrer will also be presenting Bitsquare in a  Bitcoin Meetup tour through Amsterdam, Arnhem, Barcelona, Berlin, London, Madrid, Milan, Prague, Tel Aviv, Vienna and more over the next weeks.", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 21}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nNicolas Dorier is the main developer behind NBitcoin, which is a comprehensive Bitcoin library for the .NET framework. NBitcoin is used in the backend of multiple Bitcoin services such as Lykke, BitKong, Teambrella and BTCTrader.\nRecently, Dorier has been working on various projects intended to assist developers who wish to implement the upcoming Segregated Witness (SegWit) improvement in their own wallets, exchanges and other Bitcoin-related services. Dorier, who is also a Bitcoin Core contributor, updated his book on Bitcoin programming to show people how to use SegWit in NBitcoin and also released a number of developer tools, such as checktx and checkscript, to help developers better understand how SegWit transactions work.\nIn addition to his work on these developer resources, Dorier has (perhaps more importantly) implemented SegWit in NBitcoin and bitcoinj. In a recent interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Dorier shared his thoughts on Segregated Witness and how it will affect the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nThoughts on the Adoption of SegWit by Bitcoin Services\nMany have said Segregated Witness is a set of complex code that will be difficult for wallets and other Bitcoin services to implement, but Dorier does not see things that way. The NBitcoin developer agrees with Bitcoin Core contributor Eric Lombrozo that it should take less than a week to implement this Bitcoin improvement. Dorier explained:\n\n\u201cMost of the users use abstractions above raw Bitcoin transaction programming with the classes Coin, ScripCoin and TransactionBuilder. Programmers using that don't really have to know how SegWit works, as it is similar to normal P2PKH or P2SH payments.\u201d\n\nTo illustrate his point, Dorier noted that Smartbit, an Australian Bitcoin exchange, was able to add support for SegNet (the Segregated Witness test network) in less than an hour. Dorier explained how this was possible:\n\u201cThe reason is that they only needed to update the NBitcoin libraries, run a new bitcoind, and it worked without them changing any code at all.\u201d\nDorier also shared the following thoughts on how long it will take for all Bitcoin users to start using SegWit transactions:\n\n\u201cAs with all technological progress, adoption will follow an S curve. I guess within two years, 90 percent adoption will be reached. We can probably compare that to how much time it took for P2SH to be supported widely, except that this time there is also a financial and technical incentive to do so.\u201d\n\nBitcoinJ and NBitcoin are Ready for SegWit\nDorier implemented SegWit in both NBitcoin and bitcoinj, but the changes are not yet active in bitcoinj. NBitcoin has supported SegWit since January, but bitcoinj maintainer Andreas Schildbach (whose work is now sponsored by Bloq) wants to wait for the code to evolve further. Dorier told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cI think this is important for a library to support things ahead of time so people can start playing with it and bring important feedback \u2012 feedback which can not only be useful for NBitcoin, but for the SegWit implementation in Bitcoin Core as well.\u201d\nDorier also discussed the importance libraries have in the Bitcoin ecosystem:\n\u201cInnovations bubble from Bitcoin Core up to different layers. On top of Bitcoin Core, you get libraries, and on top of libraries you get all Bitcoin services which are \u2018end user visible.\u2019\nLibraries are the bottleneck for innovation if not properly maintained, as virtually all services depend on them, so it is important to get features in the hands of our users as fast as we can.\u201d\nDorier added that Breadwallet is one of the few exceptions to the rule of services depending on libraries. Breadwallet implemented its own library in Objective-C.\nWhat a Time to Be in Bitcoin\nDorier noted that this is the most exciting year for him in Bitcoin since he joined the community in 2014.\n\u201cThe wave of innovation that will come out of CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY\u00a0and SegWit will have long-term implications that are still underrated,\u201d he said.\nLombrozo has outlined multiple use cases of the Lightning Network, which is empowered by these new protocol changes, and Dorier noted how his own company, Metaco, will combine payment hubs with the Open Asset protocol to allow colored coins to be sent for free in an off-chain environment. Dorier added, \u201cThe Bitcoin blockchain provides the insurance to the user that they can't get their token confiscated while they are off-chain in a payment channel.\u201d\nDorier recently posted some thoughts about using payment hubs in combination with the Open Asset protocol on the Coinprism blog.\n\u00a0\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

The startup was also awarded a grant by the U.K. government\u2019s Innovate UK to create a \u201cnext-generation foundational distributed ledger platform for institutional communication, authorisation, and consensus.\u201d\nEthereum has gained momentum in 2016, with the market cap of the Ether cryptocurrency recently topping $1 billion before settling back down around $650 million.\nWhat Is Ethcore?\nEthcore was founded by Ethereum co-founder and former CTO Gavin Wood. Along with Vitalik Buterin, Wood co-designed the Ethereum protocol and took a lead in various parts of the Ethereum ecosystem, including devising the Solidity programming language, refining the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and writing the acclaimed Yellow Paper, the first formal specification of a blockchain protocol.\nWood is joined by several other members of the core Ethereum team. including former head of operations Aeron Buchanan, head of communications Ken Kappler, head of security Jutta Steiner, and core developers Arkadiy Paronyan and Marek Kotewicz. According to Blockchain Capital Managing Partner Brad Stephens, it would be fair to analogize Ethcore as Ethereum\u2019s version of Blockstream, which is a startup focused on developing improvements for the Bitcoin blockchain.\nHaving said that, there are some differences between their respective business models. Stephens told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cEthcore is much more focused on building licensed, proprietary tools for large financial institutions, exchanges, and so forth, as opposed to the more open-sourced, Red Hat approach Blockstream is taking ... One of Ethcore\u2019s main value propositions is that they know Ethereum better than anyone, and thus the tools they build and deploy should buttress and catalyze Ethereum as a whole.\u201d\nAlthough Ethcore is building proprietary tools, they'll also be helping out the Ethereum community with their various open-source projects.\nButerin, who is an Ethereum Foundation board member and a partner at Fenbushi Capital,\u00a0has stated, \"We're excited to see the progress that Ethcore is making on bringing Ethereum technology to the next level through their full implementation of the Ethereum protocol in Parity, and look forward to seeing what the team will continue to bring.\u201d\nWhat Can Ethcore Do for Ethereum?\nEthcore will attempt to solve some of the current issues facing the Ethereum blockchain (and other blockchains) such as privacy and scalability. Gavin Wood told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cWe have developed high-level designs for tackling scalability and privacy that can help us overcome some of the problems and help in various settings. They'll be implemented over this year. We'll expect a much more scalable public blockchain in the next couple of years.\u201d\nIn terms of privacy, Wood added, \u201cFull privacy is still a research area with some interesting ideas that we\u2019ll be watching closely \u2013 but semi-trusted architectures on which we are working will do for many cases, particularly in the area of permissioned ledgers.\u201d\nButerin\u00a0also shared his thoughts on the future of privacy and scalability in Ethereum with Bitcoin Magazine:\n\"In the case of privacy, the basic building blocks (ring signatures, ZKPs, state channels, CT-style value encryption) are imo fairly understood and established, and it is primarily a matter of turning them into functional tools that can be used in production applications. In the case of scalability, the Ethereum research team is fairly committed to sharding; we feel that it does a good job of combining the benefits of being an on-chain scaling strategy with the decentralization benefits of maintaining a network that can theoretically run off of nothing but consumer laptops.\"\nButerin added, \"There are details that are still being worked on, but [in my opinion]\u00a0a lot of them are solidifying rapidly; we have a team that is starting work on a proof of concept in Python incorporating many of our ideas for future versions of the protocol, and we plan to validate them there before beginning development for mainline.\"\nEthcore recently released the first version of their premium Ethereum client, Parity. In addition to tackling privacy and scalability issues, Ethcore\u2019s software technology roadmap also includes improvements for light-clients for secure Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications and permissioned blockchains. The startup also intends to create application-level libraries for use by developers and third-party projects.\nAccording to Wood, the startup is currently working with French banking giant BNP Paribas on possible applications of Ethcore\u2019s technology within the world of finance. Many applications within the Etheruem ecosystem, such as Digix, Augur, Grid Singularity, and Slock.it are also looking at Ethcore\u2019s technology.\nBlockchain Capital\u2019s Thoughts on Ethereum and Rootstock\nWhen asked if Blockchain Capital will invest in other, future Ethereum projects, Brad Stephens replied, \u201cAssuming that the multi-chain world we have been forecasting for some time now comes to fruition, it\u2019s hard to imagine not investing further in the Ethereum ecosystem.\u201d\nStephens also noted that the venture capital firm already has another stealth Ethereum startup. He added:\n\u201cWe have been taking lots of meetings with companies building on the Ethereum blockchain. Moreover, we have seen a steady uptick in Ethereum side projects and initiatives coming out of our portfolio companies.\u201d\nStephens stated that Ethereum is still a \u201cnascent technology,\u201d which means many of its initial, obvious use cases will not come to fruition over the near term, as was the case with Bitcoin.\nIn terms of Rootstock, which is a Bitcoin sidechain, Stephens said the Ethereum-esque project plays no role in the potential success of Ethereum as a platform. Stephens explained his reasoning:\n\u201cRootstock is an exciting project. A few weeks ago, the developers announced that Rootstock will take a 20 percent cut of every transaction, which makes them an intermediary, and possibility an operator from a legal perspective. There\u2019s no reason not to cut them out, pay all the fees to miners, and increase security. Or just use Ethereum.\u201d\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s market capitalization has grown so immensely in the past few months, it\u2019s getting harder to make the security argument that once existed for Bitcoin over Ethereum,\u201d Stephens told Bitcoin Magazine.\nThis article has been updated with further thoughts on privacy from Vitalik Buterin.\nDisclosure: Fenbushi Capital is an investor in BTC Media,\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine's\u00a0parent company.\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

In an April 19 article, it published an article\u00a0saying:\n\n\u201cThe last 24 days mark the longest period in which bitcoin prices have been less volatile than gold prices, going back to 2010. Some point to the drop as a sign that investor perception of bitcoin is drawing closer to gold as a safe store of value.\u201d\n\nAnd, as the article notes, \u201cAccording to Wedbush Securities data, monthly bitcoin transactions increased from 200,000 in January 2012 to more than 6 million in March this year.\"\nBitcoin Has Stability\nStatistics aggregated\u00a0by companies such as Blockchain\u00a0and Kaiko show a slow but steady increase in the health of Bitcoin on many measures over the past several months, including transaction volume, price, market capitalization and hash rate.\nDespite technical challenges and uncertainty, Bitcoin price and transaction volume have kept a steady pace for the last year.\nBitcoin Price Is Steadily Increasing\nIn a year of conflict and uncertainty, the price of Bitcoin has remained remarkably steady with a few upticks and downturns, but overall steadily climbing to today\u2019s value of approximately $450 USD.\nThis more than any other indicator suggests that there is inherent stability in the Bitcoin ecosystem, and many Bitcoin traders don\u2019t seem particularly worried about the ongoing block size debate.\n\nBitcoin Transaction Volume Is Tracking at a New High\nAs the following graph from Kaiko\u00a0shows, there have been some ups and downs but overall the volume of transactions is steadily climbing.\n\nBitcoin Mining Is Only Getting More Popular\nDespite seemingly endless wrangling among developers over how to handle increased Bitcoin transactions\u00a0volumes and sometimes narrowing profit margins for miners, existing mining companies are steadily growing and new miners are coming online.\nAs Brock Pierce recently noted: \u201cBitcoin is so successful \u2012 it\u2019s growing exponentially \u2012 and as a result of that, we\u2019re running into scalability issues.\u201d\nBitcoin data site Kaiko indicates a steadily climbing hash rate \u2013 the measuring unit of the processing power of the Bitcoin network and a key indicator that miners are working despite continuing uncertainty around scalability.\n\nBlockchain\u2019s Success Does Not Mean Bitcoin Is Unsuccessful\nOne of the common phrases heard\u00a0about Bitcoin runs something like this: \u201cBitcoin may be 'a failed experiment' but blockchain technology \u2013 the technology that powers Bitcoin \u2013 is the next big thing.\u201d\nThis reasoning seems to suggest we can\u2019t have both, but if blockchain technology works well then how bad can Bitcoin be?", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 22}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nRoughly two months ago, Lightning Network creators Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja visited the Coinbase offices to explain how their design works and answer some questions from Coinbase employees and executives. After an explanation of why the duo does not believe centralization via supernodes will be an issue on the network, they went into a related aspect of the system: the extremely low fees.\nDryja and Poon claimed that the high level of competition between Lightning Network hubs will drive down fees on the network to practically zero.\nA Lot of People Think They\u2019ll Make Money\nMany holders of bitcoins are excited for the upcoming release of the Lightning Network on the Bitcoin blockchain because it offers them a chance to earn a return on their digital currency holdings. Having said that, the very fact that many people are looking forward to operating Lightning Network hubs means that there will be a fair amount of competition for routing transactions on the network.\nDryja explained this phenomenon:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people with bitcoin, and they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh. I\u2019m going to run a Lightning node, and I\u2019m going to make so much money\u2019 ... The thing is, there\u2019s a lot of people saying that, so there\u2019s going to be a lot of competition.\u201d\n\nDryja also compared operating a Lightning Network hub to Bitcoin mining, although he stated the tendencies toward centralization are weaker due to the extremely low barriers to entry.\u00a0\n\u201cIt sort of feels like mining, but worse,\u201d he said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t even capital costs to get the equipment. All you need is a computer, an Internet connection and bitcoin.\u201d\nCompetition Should Drive Down Fees\nWhen estimating the costs of using the Lightning Network, Poon went as far as to say, \u201cThe fees people are going to charge are going to be effectively near zero. If you really game it out for a lot of payments, one satoshi is too high; that\u2019s really what we\u2019re looking at.\u201d\nSome have also hinted that fees on the Lightning Network could be literally zero in certain cases due to the opportunities for collecting data on the network; however, it\u2019s unclear how new privacy features could affect this profit model.\nIn terms of one\u2019s ability to earn a profit on the Lightning Network, Dryja added, \u201cMaking money off the intermediary routing \u00e2\u20ac\u2019 it\u2019s really hard. It\u2019s really easy to spin up new nodes.\u201d\nLightning Can Handle Much Higher On-Chain Fees\nPoon also offered an analogy to the Internet in an effort to explain the low barriers to entry for operating a Lightning Network hub. He explained:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like the Internet. With the Internet, there\u2019s actual, physical connectivity, and you can extract rent from that. With this, it\u2019s a virtual layer on top of that. Basically, it\u2019s a function of the cost of the transaction fees on [the blockchain], which is pretty cheap.\u201d\n\nPoon added that fees on the network would still be extremely low in a situation where on-chain transaction fees rose to levels 400 times where they are today. He stated:\n\n\u201cEven if it goes obscene, which ideally it shouldn\u2019t go obscene, but even if it\u2019s something crazy like $20, you\u2019re not going to be able to extract much rent.\u201d\n\nAlthough some individuals who were hoping to earn a serious profit on the Lightning Network are likely to be upset by Dryja and Poon\u2019s comments, the vast majority of the community will still be able to benefit from the scaling opportunities presented by this new system for instant Bitcoin micropayments. According to the duo behind the original concept, the Lightning Network will be able to scale Bitcoin to millions (or perhaps billions) of transactions per second.\n\u00a0\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe\u00a0Bitcoin Core development team launched a \u201cSponsorship Programme\u201d on Monday that intends to provide an easy access point for the Bitcoin industry to support Bitcoin's long-time reference client with both funding and other types of contributions.\nBitcoin Core developer and\u00a0Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo:\n\n\u201cThe entire ecosystem depends on projects like Bitcoin Core, but most companies haven't really had a way of contributing resources for this effectively. We want to offer that, and encourage greater involvement in the development process.\u201d\n\nFunding\nThe sponsorship program is not the first attempt to fund Bitcoin development. But over the years, it was difficult to provide a consistent stream of income for the most active contributors to the project, as most companies were hesitant to contribute. And donation and crowdfunding-based methods proved insufficient.\nLombrozo explained:\n\n\u201cFunding Bitcoin development has always been a complicated issue. A first attempt to structurally ensure funding for the team, the Bitcoin Foundation, was established in 2012, but ran out of funds last year. Since then,\u00a0MIT Media Lab's Digital Currency Initiative pays the salaries of three developers: Wladimir van der Laan, Cory Fields and Gavin Andresen. Others \u2013 like myself \u2013 fund our work through a company we founded ourselves, while a small number of developers are hired by companies. And some volunteer their efforts.\u201d\n\nThe sponsorship program is perhaps the most direct way for industry players to help fund the development process yet. Potential sponsors can contact some of the most active developers of the project directly through email, after which arrangements can be set up.\nProjects\nAlong with the announcement of the program, the Bitcoin Core development team published a\u00a0list of projects that require funding or resources (or both.) These include technical projects to improve the Bitcoin Core software and the Bitcoin protocol in various ways, such as increased privacy features, faster block propagation methods and overall research.\u00a0\nThe page also lists more general tasks, such as website maintenance, public relations and education. Bitcoin companies can propose projects themselves as well.\nLombrozo:\n\n\u201cThe current Bitcoin ecosystem has received tremendous amounts of investment at the application level \u00e2\u20ac\u2019 but this is still very new technology, and we need more investment in infrastructure and basic research and development. We want to encourage the development of a vibrant ecosystem with many different companies working together to build this infrastructure and solve key problems in the tech and other areas.\u201d\n\nMuch like the typical non-specific rough consensus-based decision-making process, the main contributors to the implementation, along with the potential sponsor, will decide whether a project can be funded, and how.\nAs the sponsorship program page on the Bitcoin Core website explains:\n\u201cBitcoin Core will always progress on the path of technical and scientific based research and requirements that are compatible with the goals of the Bitcoin system. [P]rivacy, censorship resistance, decentralization, and voluntaryism are key tenets of Bitcoin. Sponsorships therefore cannot guarantee a particular feature would make it into the Bitcoin Core software and even if included, ultimately Bitcoin users decide what software they run, and what features get adopted.\u201d\nAnd:\n\u201c[S]ponsorships will be screened for compatibility in advance, so that if the requisite research and development are done, and if the work it passes peer review, there is every reason to believe it could become part of the Bitcoin Core software.\u201d\nAll funded projects will be managed by a dedicated project lead developer, who is responsible for coordination of the project, such as allocating the available funds and reporting on the progress. Most of the specifics are to be worked out between the Bitcoin Core development team and the potential sponsor, however.\nThe current sponsorship program is specifically intended for industry players. Bitcoin Core does not (yet) have any mechanisms in place to accept smaller donations.\n\u00a0\nFor more information on Bitcoin Core's sponsorship program, see the initiative's\u00a0FAQ.", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 5}

These bitcoins could furthermore be subject to self-employment tax.\nIn some places, if you earn money by trading bitcoins or running an exchange, this could be included in gross income and treated as capital gains. This interpretation assumes bitcoins are used as a store of value like gold or another commodity. If treated as currency or debt, the gains could be taxed based on market value at the end of each tax year.\u00a0\nSome common sense assumptions about how Bitcoin will be regulated can be made by the nature of Bitcoin itself \u00e2\u20ac\u2019 for instance, by tying the value of bitcoins to the local fiat currency. So when one receives a bitcoin, a note should be made of that coin\u2019s USD value (or whatever currency) as a cost basis for tax reporting. \u00a0\nThe existing framework applies to miners. Mined coins are recorded as income from mining and are taxable, and expenses are deducted. Many miners sell their bitcoins, and miners are taxed on the increase in Bitcoin value from the time the coins were mined and the value for which they sold. If this is a loss, then this loss can be declared.\u00a0\nIn the United States, the IRS issued guidance for Bitcoin and other digital currencies in its March 2014-21 Notice. \u00a0The IRS clarified its position on digital currencies, which it views as capital assets and thus subject to capital gains taxes. Trading and spending is a taxable event and capital gains must be calculated in USD.\u00a0\nThe IRS also stated mined bitcoins are treated as immediate income at the market value of those mined coins on their date of mining.\n\u201cMost don\u2019t know they can write off any losses they have,\u201d said Libra founder Jake Benson. \u201cThe IRS allows you to offset income by up to $3,000 per year on capital losses. \u00a0If you have losses and you aren\u2019t writing them off, then it\u2019s like throwing money away. Nobody likes doing taxes, but if you can owe less or increase your return, then doing your Bitcoin taxes often results in a benefit. In fact, the majority of our users are filing a capital loss, which means they\u2019ve actually saved money by using our tool.\u201d\u00a0\nBenson also gives insight for miners.\u00a0\n\u201cMining is considered income, so know the price of Bitcoin at the time you mined it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you make money on Bitcoin trading, the IRS requires that you report gains with line level detail.\u201d \u00a0The appropriate form for that is 8949, a sub-form of schedule D. Gains and losses, as outlined above, are treated like every other capital asset.\u00a0\n\u201cBitcoin cannot be considered a foreign currency by the IRS because it\u2019s not legal tender and it\u2019s not produced by a government,\u201d he said. \u201cThough it functions like a currency, the letter of the law is very clear.\u201d\nThere have been numerous decisions by government bodies regarding the regulation of Bitcoin. For instance, the Commodity Futures Trade Commission ruled Bitcoin can be treated as a commodity. Commodities are taxed with 60/40 rules. Other capital assets, basic securities for instance, are taxed with short and long term rates.\u00a0\n\u201cThe IRS might need to issue another notice that clarifies which method to follow because taxpayers may get confused,\u201d Benson noted. On a global level, some places are better than others when it comes to taxation. Benson cites Australia as one such region.\u00a0\n\u201cLike Europe, there is a concept of Value Added Tax (VAT) called GST,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout getting into too much detail, Australia's tax authority decided that the GST applies to all sales of Bitcoin. That decision basically prevented any Bitcoin exchange from operating in Australia because they would be forced to apply a 10 percent markup on top of market price. Europe also has a concept of VAT, and a court there recently ruled Bitcoin would not be subject to VAT. \u00a0This would have a \u00a0huge impact on Bitcoin businesses that are involved with the purchase and sale of Bitcoin.\u201d \u00a0Benson notes, however, this is undergoing a change.\u00a0\nFew countries have outlawed Bitcoin. In some countries though, there is no tax applied to capital gains at all, which results in a essentially no tax obligations for owners or traders of Bitcoin. Benson believes regulators are investigating their options when it comes to the regulation and taxation of Bitcoin. In the UK, regulators determined VAT would not apply to Bitcoin sales.\u00a0\n\u201cProbably closer than one would assume,\u201d Benson noted. \u201cAn IRS agent was capable of tracing tumbled coins on the blockchain as evidence in the case regarding Carl Force from the DEA. He was sentenced to jail for six-and-a-half months. It\u2019s quite common for individuals in the Bitcoin industry to villainize government, but I\u2019ve observed that it\u2019s also common for individuals to underestimate government prudence.\u201d\u00a0\nThere are some obstacles when it comes to filing Bitcoin taxes, Benson admits, such as the aggregation of transactional data. \u201cMost people have more than one exchange account and more than a few wallets,\u201d he said. \u201c\nIn the future, Benson believes Bitcoin will treated similarly as today.\u00a0\n\u201cRealistically, the same way it is now,\u201d he said. \u201cFor perspective, it took the IRS 15 years to produce tax rules that applied to derivatives. \u00a0If special guidance for digital currency is to ever come, I would predict at least a decade. Furthermore, you have cost basis reporting rules on fancy asset types that were only finalized in place about 3 years ago. \u00a0If anything, I would guess the reporting requirements 10 years from now will be more than what they are today.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 4}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nWhile many people take the view that Bitcoin is dying or failing due to its current issues with governance and scalability, Blockchain Capital founder and managing partner Brock Pierce believes this current controversy is a good sign. In his view, the fact that there are so many transactions on the network should be seen in a positive light because it\u2019s a sign of the technology\u2019s success.\nIn a recent interview with Epicenter Bitcoin, Pierce explained his point of view on the Bitcoin block size debate and how it is currently causing uncertainty in the market.\nScalability Is a Good Problem to Have\nThe key point that Pierce, who is also the chairman of the board at the Bitcoin Foundation, wanted to make in regard to Bitcoin\u2019s scalability issues had to do with the perspective that most people take on the topic. Instead of the usual, negative view, Pierce stated:\n\u201cBitcoin is so successful \u2012 it\u2019s growing exponentially \u2012 and as a result of that, we\u2019re running into scalability issues.\u201d\nPierce went on to note that scalability is an issue that often impacts the most successful companies and technologies. He explained:\n\n\u201cThese are the problems that Facebook has. This is the problem WhatsApp has. This is the problem of very, very successful technologies, so let\u2019s make sure that we understand that we\u2019re not talking about Bitcoin as a failure; we\u2019re saying, \u2018Bitcoin is a success, and as a result of that, we need to scale it.\u2019\u201d\n\nPierce then added, \u201cBitcoin is becoming a victim of its own success.\u201d\nNot Willing to Say He Has a Solution\nAlthough Pierce believes that Bitcoin\u2019s scalability issues will likely be solved eventually, he does not want to say that he has all the answers. For this decision, he prefers to defer to the people who have been developing and scaling Bitcoin up to this point. Pierce stated:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the person who\u2019s best qualified to say, \u2018This is the right approach.\u2019 ... I\u2019m going to defer to the Core developers. I spend a lot of time talking with many of them, trying to understand why they have differing views, and then try to help bring people together so people can understand concerns that another might have, so we reach consensus sooner rather than later.\u201d\n\nThe Blockchain Capital founder also pointed out that Bitcoin developers are issuing their own proposals for how to scale the system, and Bitcoin\u2019s governance system should be able to take care of the rest. In the past, Pierce has compared the developers, miners, companies and stakeholders in Bitcoin to a system of checks and balances.\nScaling Bitcoin Is Causing Uncertainty in Bitcoin Market\nAlthough he\u2019d like to see the system scale sooner rather than later, Pierce seems prepared to leave this decision to the experts. Having said that, he also understands that the current controversy is causing uncertainty in the Bitcoin market.\u00a0\n\u201cFinancial markets really hate \u2012 they dislike \u2012 uncertainty,\u201d he noted.\nPierce also explained how the current issues around the block size limit and governance are affecting the view of Bitcoin from the outside:\n\n\u201cThe people who were thinking about getting involved, the people that like the technology, and the people that had ambitions or plans to play here \u2012 a lot of those people are being turned off by what I like to think of as self-inflicted wounds.\u201d\n\nOne of the final points Pierce made on this matter is the effect a hard fork to another development team could have on the Bitcoin price. Although he said he doesn\u2019t have a crystal ball, and hindsight would be preferred in the development of an opinion on this, Pierce stated:\n\n\u201cWe could end up seeing a hard fork [away from Bitcoin Core].

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nAlmost two years\u00a0ago, a group of Bitcoin developers, including Amir Taaki, developed an early prototype of a decentralized marketplace during the Toronto Bitcoin Expo Hackathon. The team behind the project, which also included developers from Airbitz, won the hackathon for their work on DarkMarket, but they had no intention of working on the concept once the expo was over.\nShortly after the creation of DarkMarket, a group of new developers, including Brian Hoffman and Sam Patterson, forked the project and rebranded it as OpenBazaar. Today, the first full version of OpenBazaar has been released on the project\u2019s official website.\nWhat\u2019s in This First Release?\nAlthough the first full version of OpenBazaar is now available, it does not come with all of the features that users will likely want to see in an online, decentralized marketplace. Having said that, all of the tools for launching an online store with essentially no upfront costs are now available when merchants combine Bitcoin with this new merchant platform.\nIn comments shared with Bitcoin Magazine, OpenBazaar Project Lead and OB1 CEO Hoffman described the features available in this first release:\n\n\u201cThis version is complete from end to end to allow purchase of physical, digital goods and services either directly or moderated. It also allows you to rate your purchases and garner reputation on a basic level. It has an encrypted chat capability that we think will help users communicate more efficiently during trade as well.\u201d\n\nAlthough many media outlets have referred to OpenBazaar as a \u201cdecentralized Silk Road,\u201d support for anonymizing networks, such as Tor, is not yet available out of the box. Hoffman recently explained the development team\u2019s reasoning for leaving out this feature in the first release.\nWhat Will Come Next?\nThis first version of the decentralized marketplace is bound to garner a large amount of support from day one, but there is still plenty of work to be done for the OpenBazaar development team. Hoffman told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n\u201cThe next steps will be to continue iterating on the current product and hit some of our most wanted list, which includes improving privacy and security of merchants as well as mobile and offline store support so that users don\u2019t have to run their servers 24/7.\u201d\n\nHoffman also stated that support for anonymizing networks and improvements to the reputation system will be coming soon.\nWho Will Be the Early Adopters of OpenBazaar?\nHoffman said that most of the early users will likely be smaller merchants, perhaps selling Bitcoin-related products; however, the OB1 CEO added, \u201c[We] hope to start accommodating larger merchants and we might have some additional surprises in the near future.\u201d\nOpenBazaar is now available for download on the project\u2019s official website. Hoffman told Bitcoin Magazine he wanted to thank everyone who has been involved in the project in any way over the past year. He stated:\n\n\u201cThe last thought I wanted to leave is that this has been a long time coming and we want to make sure everyone knows that this was a community effort that involved all those who worked on Bitcoin proper, built the DarkMarket proof of concept, and anyone else who contributed to the project financially or code-wise over that time.

The investment was announced at a media conference in Barbados hosted by Avatar Capital, which invested in Bitt, and attended by representatives from both Bitt and Overstock. Politicians and dignitaries from various Caribbean nations attended.\n\u201cA major impediment to economic advancement around the world is the fact that the vast majority of humans are unbanked,\u201d said Overstock CEO Patrick M. Byrne. \u201cYet mobile penetration in some countries exceeds 100 percent. Bitt has a vision for the Caribbean of frictionless mobile cash, beginning with central banks transparently issuing digital fiat which is then exchanged on a blockchain (all under proper regulatory oversight, as with our t0 offering to Wall Street). We respect and endorse that vision, and share a common desire to see online consensual exchange flourish globally. As they say around these parts, \u2018One love.\u2019\u201d\nReuters notes that Overstock, the first U.S. company with annual sales of at least $1 billion to accept Bitcoin as a mode of payment, has been one of the earliest advocates of digital currencies. In June, Bitcoin Magazine reported that Overstock had become the first company to offer qualified buyers the option of purchasing corporate bonds that will trade using Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain protocol.\u00a0\nIn October Overstock completed a production beta test of its t0 software by successfully using the Bitcoin blockchain to record evidence of compliance with applicable regulations. T0 partnered with a number of banks, including the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), which Relbanks ranked as the largest bank in the world, to test its technology. That technology could eventually be used to sidestep traditional stock exchanges such as NYSE and NASDAQ and issue corporate stock directly over the Internet.\nBitt, Inc., founded in 2013, is based in Hastings, Barbados, is a digital asset exchange, which owns and operates a trading platform for Bitcoin and other fiat currencies. The company focuses on providing access to cryptocurrencies in emerging markets. Bitt\u2019s platform allows traders worldwide to deposit their currency or digital assets and trade with those funds. The company\u2019s software suite includes a digital asset exchange, a mobile money wallet, a remittance platform, and merchant payment processing tools.\nOverstock.com is investing $4 million in Bitt initially. The Bitt announcement reveals that Overstock plans staggered investments for a total of $16 million USD, placing the company\u2019s valuation at $50 million. Bitt intends to use new funding to build a financial ecosystem in the Caribbean to solve the issues that people in the region experience daily, including high frictional fees from banks and money services operations that make sending money in and out of the region difficult and costly.\nIn February, Bitt launched a digitized Barbados dollar on the Bitcoin blockchain. The value of Bitt\u2019s digital Barbados dollar is pegged to the real currency unit issued by the central bank.\u00a0\n\u201cOne of our digital Barbados dollars is equivalent to one dollar issued by the Central Bank of Barbados. What we do is allow people to do more with their money,\u201d said Bitt co-founder and CEO Gabriel Abed. Now Bitt intends to digitize all of the fiat currencies used in the Caribbean region and place them on the blockchain so they can be easily traded between the islands, bringing modern solutions to a region historically limited by inefficient exchange and settlement systems.\nChristopher Sinckler, Barbados minister of finance, confirmed that the initiative has the full support of the government and referred to the project as an important milestone for the Caribbean region.\u00a0\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, welcome to the future,\u201d he said.\n\u201cRegional small businesses find it financially prohibitive to offer online payment options to consumers, and this places a drag on entrepreneurism in the Caribbean,\u201d said Abed. \u201cOur aim is to use cryptography and digital ledger technology to turn our regional citizens into global citizens, giving them the ability to send or receive money directly via their phones, in seconds, from all corners of the globe.\u201d\nOliver Gale, Bitt CFO and co-founder, added that Bitt is bringing modern financial solutions to a previously backward region without efficient settlement systems. \u201cBitt\u2019s financial technology revolution will bring to consumers a faster, better, cheaper and more traceable way of banking \u00e2\u20ac\u2019 and we now have a new, multi-billion dollar backed investor to help make this vision a reality,\u201d Gale said.\nIt seems likely that support from the Barbados government and other governments in the Caribbean region, as well as Overstock\u2019s investment and support, could turn Bitt\u2019s project into a high profile initiative whose impact could extend beyond the region.", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 6}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nFunding Bitcoin development seems to have always been problematic.\nWhile the Bitcoin industry collectively has raised more than a billion dollars worth of investment\u00a0over the past years, development of the\u00a0Free and Open Source Software the industry largely relies on\u00a0has always had trouble gathering sufficient funds and manpower for development. Several arrangements\u00a0to raise funds have been tried over the years \u2013 but with varying degrees of success and longevity.\nBitcoin Core, considered by many to be Bitcoin's \u201creference client,\u201d therefore, announced a \u201cSponsorship Programme\u201d earlier this week. As the latest effort to raise funds, this program is intended to be an easy access-point for companies and other Bitcoin industry players to support Bitcoin Core developers and projects. Companies that decide to take part in the sponsorship program will join a, so-far, short list of entities that do already help fund Bitcoin Core development.\nThese are the main sources of funding as it currently stands:\nMIT Media Lab's Digital Currency Initiative\nShortly after the\u00a0effective bankruptcy of the\u00a0Bitcoin Foundation a year ago, the three Bitcoin Core developers funded by this foundation \u2013 lead maintainer Wladimir van der Laan, former lead Gavin Andresen and Cory Fields \u2013 were hired by the then newly established\u00a0MIT Media Lab's Digital Currency Initiative.\nThe MIT Media Lab is an interdisciplinary research laboratory headed by tech-veteran\u00a0Joi Ito, while its Digital Currency Initiative is headed by former White House adviser Brian Forde.\u00a0According to Forde, the Digital Currency Initiative intends to provide a neutral academic working environment for the developers.\nAll three developers on Digital Currency Initiative's payroll are said to enjoy almost complete freedom; they are even allowed to work on alternative Bitcoin implementations if they wish. (Andresen works for\u00a0no single implementation in particular, and mostly switched his efforts to\u00a0Bitcoin XT and\u00a0Bitcoin Classic over the past year.)\nNeither MIT nor the Media Lab or its Digital Currency Initiative put up the money to fund the developers themselves, however. Instead, the Digital Currency Initiative relies on\u00a0\u201cunrestricted gifts\u201d from sponsors, including mining specialists BitFury and Bitmain, wallet service Circle, API-provider Chain, the Nasdaq stock exchange, venture capitalist Fred Wilson, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and others.\nBlockstream\nBlockstream was founded in 2014 by Bitcoin Core developers Gregory Maxwell, Dr. Pieter Wuille, Matt Corallo, Jorge Tim\u00f3n and Mark Friedenbach, as well as several non-Bitcoin Core developers including\u00a0hashcash inventor Dr. Adam Back and venture capitalist Austin Hill. Since its launch, the Montreal-headquartered company also hired developers Gregory Sanders, Patrick Strateman and Glenn Willen to work on Bitcoin Core. Another Bitcoin Core developer, Luke Dashjr, works for Blockstream as a contractor.\nBlockstream's main mission is the realization of sidechain technology, which the company has done with\u00a0Elements and\u00a0Liquid so far.\u00a0\nBlockstream developers typically work toward this goal, which they say generally aligns with their own long-term vision for Bitcoin. But developers on Blockstream's payroll \u2013 who typically co-own the company as well \u2013 are also encouraged to work on Bitcoin Core development in a more general sense.\u00a0\nAccording to Blockstream president Back, this is because \u201cthe company has an interest to see Bitcoin maintained, developed and scale.\u201d Some of Blockstream's developers, like Wuille, work on Bitcoin Core-specific development almost exclusively.\nAs part of their contracts, all Blockstream developers also have time-locked bitcoins to ensure they are incentivized to work toward Bitcoin's success. These contracts also include so-called \u201cmorality clauses\u201d: If Blockstream asks any of them to work against what they consider to be in Bitcoin's best interest, they can refuse to do so while still guaranteed a salary.\nSince its conception, Blockstream has grown to be one of the top-funded Bitcoin companies in the space, with total investments adding up to\u00a0$76 million from various (institutional) investors including Horizons Ventures, AXA Strategic Ventures, Digital Garage and, again, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.\nChaincode Labs Inc.\nChaincode Labs Inc. is a New York-based cryptocurrency research and development company founded by Alex Morcos and Suhas Daftuar in 2014. While the two founders were not Bitcoin Core developers at that time, they set-out to research Bitcoin by getting involved with development, and have done so ever since.\nThe company is also self-funded by Morcos and Daftuar, meaning they essentially pay for their own development for Bitcoin Core through their company. This means that Morcos and Daftuar enjoy complete freedom to work on whichever project they like, and however they like.\nCiphrex\nCiphrex was founded in 2014 by Bitcoin Core developer Eric Lombrozo and his father Enrique Lombrozo. The San Diego-based software company is best known for mSIGNA, an enterprise-level secure Bitcoin wallet, and CoinSocket, an application development platform.\nAccording to Lombrozo, he contributes to Bitcoin Core because he believes in the future of this technology, and considers working with the world's top experts in the field a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Plus: \u201cSomeone needs to do it.\u201d\nSince Lombrozo is both the Ciphrex's CEO and a Bitcoin Core developer, he can contribute to Bitcoin's reference client in whichever way he believes is most useful.\nCiphrex\u00a0raised $500,000 through a Series A stock offering last year.\nBTCC\nFounded in 2011, Shanghai-based Bitcoin exchange, mining pool and wallet service\u00a0BTCC is one of the oldest and largest Bitcoin companies in the world.\nTo support the Bitcoin ecosystem, BTCC recently\u00a0hired Peter Todd to work on Bitcoin Core for a minimum of 14 hours a month. Todd is free to work on whichever Bitcoin Core-related projects he wants, \u201cno strings attached,\u201d on the one condition that he provides a weekly report on his development efforts. The arrangement will last for at least six months.\nBTCC\u00a0raised $5 million in a Series A led by institutional investors\u00a0Lightspeed China Partners and\u00a0Lightspeed Venture Partners in 2013.\nOther\nThe entities listed above are the most clear examples of companies and other Bitcoin industry players funding Bitcoin development. But it should be noted that this list is not conclusive, especially because there is significant gray area.\nSome companies (such as Bitware Co. and BitPay) fund development of alternative Bitcoin implementations, of which the code can potentially be forked and included in Bitcoin Core. Other companies (including Lightning, Blockchain and, again, Blockstream) fund development of lightning networks, which is technically not Bitcoin Core, but is closely intertwined as it works toward the same vision and mission for Bitcoin.\u00a0\nDevelopers working for yet other companies (including 21 Inc. and LedgerX) provide somewhat informal support through documentation or other help. And, as mentioned, this list is not conclusive.\nAnd, of course, the \u201cSponsorship Programme\u201d might add new names to the list soon.", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 6}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nUp to this point, the main way to judge support for a change to Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules has been miner voting. Miners are able to broadcast support for changes to the Bitcoin protocol via coinbase transactions, and these messages of support are tabulated in an effort to judge the level of support among those who are theoretically incentivized to support the network.\nOn a recent episode of The Crypto Show, Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd discussed the idea of allowing users to vote (or signal support) for hard forks, which is a concept that was heavily discussed at the Satoshi Roundtable in late February. During the interview, Todd summarized why having users vote for changes to Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules would be an improvement over miner voting:\n\u201cSomething like coin voting \u2012 that could give you much better feedback on what people actually want. Right now, we don\u2019t really have a good way of getting feedback.\u201d\nThis improved feedback would make hard forks safer because it would give a clearer indication of the level of support for the fork before it is activated. A hard fork without near universal support from users has the potential to create two\u00a0competing Bitcoin blockchains. Although miner voting is currently available, those votes don\u2019t indicate whether the economic majority will also go along with changes agreed upon by the mining community.\nHow Can Bitcoin Users Vote for Hard Forks?\nTodd noted that this is especially useful during hard forks. Todd explained the basics of how this voting would work:\n\u201cAs part of the hard fork to increase the block size, part of the conditions for actually triggering this hard fork (in the code to actually say this software is now active) would be that you go vote with your bitcoins.\u201d\nTodd also noted that Bitcoin transactions are really nothing more than cryptographically signed messages broadcast on the network. These messages essentially tell the rest of the network to transfer ownership of a certain amount of bitcoins from one address to another. Todd explained that other vote-related messages could also be sent out to the network:\n\u201cWhat we talk about when we say voting is to say, as part of that message, you could either say on top of that, \u2018This transaction that gives those bitcoins to someone else \u2012 I also happen to support this change.\u2019 Treat that as a vote for the change, or you could go and vote entirely separately, which isn\u2019t even in a transaction.\u201d\nHow Would This Work in Practice?\nTodd explained that the simplest implementation of user voting would likely be a flag in Bitcoin wallets that asks users whether they support a potential change to Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules. In this way, users would have the option to vote every time they use Bitcoin to send value over the Internet.\nExactly how the voting would work is still up for debate. Some believe that each user should be able to flag their transactions with a vote on every transaction, while others believe this would be something better handled by wallet developers. This part of the discussion gets into the debate over whether Bitcoin should operate as a democracy or a technocracy. Todd indicated that he leaned toward allowing users to handle their own votes, but he added, \u201cIt\u2019s not a technical question; it\u2019s a political question.\u201d\nUsing Bitcoin Days Destroyed\nOf course, some issues could arise by simply allowing users to vote on changes to Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules with their bitcoins. For example, one user could vote many times by simply exchanging the same small amount of bitcoins between his or her own addresses. Todd compared this type of voting to counting votes in an election based on how many times people were able to visit the polls on Election Day. He added, \u201cYou want something that\u2019s more like one bitcoin equals one vote.\u201d\nTo ensure that vote tallies are an accurate depiction of what the overall community believes, it would make sense to use Bitcoin Days Destroyed. This metric multiplies the value of a Bitcoin transaction by the number of days since those bitcoins were last moved. Todd noted:\n\u201cThat means, essentially, everyone\u2019s vote is counted equally in proportion to how many bitcoins they have and how long they\u2019ve held them.\u201d\nUsing Bitcoin Days Destroyed for votes would create a system somewhat similar to shareholder voting. Todd explained, \u201cIf you hold more bitcoins than I do, you get a bigger proportion of the vote, which makes a lot of sense. You\u2019re more invested in the system.\u201d\nProblems With Coin Voting Still Exist\nCoin voting is not without its own issues. The key problem with this system for gauging consensus is that it could be difficult to inform the public on how they\u2019re supposed to cast their votes or even that a vote is taking place. Having said that, Todd added that the fact a hard fork would affect everyone on the network could make more people inclined to vote on potential changes to Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules.\nMiner voting is the best option for gauging consensus on protocol changes right now, but coin voting may become an even more powerful indicator of fork support in the not-too-distant future.\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto introduced transaction replacement in his initial release of the Bitcoin Software, but removed it due to denial of service problems, which opt-in RBF solves by adding a higher fee for transaction replacement.\u00a0\nIt is a slight variation of Replace-by-Fee, another feature included in Bitcoin Core. A full analysis of RBF, written by Aaron Van Wirdum can be found here.\nPeter Todd, a Bitcoin Core developer who worked on the opt-in RBF project, publicly expressed concern in a blog post that opt-in RBF wallets are not yet ready to implement detection software for opt-in RBF transactions. He wrote that wallets without this software implemented leave users at a greater risk of being cheated by double-spenders, especially for zero-confirmation transaction (zero-confs). This can lead people to believe that the community should wait to integrate opt-in RBF.\u00a0\nTodd also admits that this is only a valid concern if merchants and consumer wallets were able to warn users of potential double-spend attempts before the integration of opt-in RBF. If wallets are currently unable to properly detect and warn their users, scammers would have no need to use opt-in RBF, as they would have no problem using the existing system.\nTodd actually tested the current level of security of popular user wallets against double-spends attacks and posted his findings in a list, as seen below.\n\nWallets not only failed to warn users that a double-spend might happen, the majority even failed to warn their users that a double-spend has happened.\nHalf the wallets tested could be double-spent by an attacker with nearly zero technical sophistication with 100 percent probability of success.\nThe other half could be double-spent with about 25 percent success rates, again by an attacker with nearly zero technical sophistication.\n\nThis means that opt-in RBF will not raise users\u2019 vulnerability to double-spends, as people are already vulnerable with most wallet service providers in the current system until the transaction has been confirmed in the blockchain.\nOn the other hand, executives of merchant services platforms such as Stephen Pair from BitPay and Jamie Robinson from AcceptBT have been quick to integrate RBF detection software as part as their strategy to mitigate zero-conf risk.\u00a0\nStephen Pair wrote in a blog post that Bitpay was \u201cthrilled when we saw that Opt-In RBF was merged.\u201d He explained that \u201cboth the \u2018first seen\u2019 and \u2018RBF\u2019 behaviors are useful and valuable features of the mesh network. The \u2018first seen\u2019 behavior is not being dropped and existing wallets and infrastructure that make use of the \u2018first seen\u2019 behavior will not be affected (except for minor changes needed to detect RBF transactions). This new functionality makes Bitcoin itself more valuable.\u201d\nRobinson told Bitcoin Magazine that he simply changed the user interface of AcceptBT to account for the possibility of opt-in RBF. Now, if a transaction has a possible double spend a message displays to notify the merchant that this transaction is not eligible for instant approval, and a pending transaction shows up in their merchant terminal.\n\u00a0\nPhoto\u00a0Groman123\u00a0/ Flickr(CC)", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 7}

The company was granted an e-money license by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority.\nCircle is extending the ability to hold and pay in U.S. dollars, available in all U.S. states, to Circle account holders in the U.K. British Circle users are now able to hold GBP and make GBP payments instantly, with zero fees. Circle also announced that it\u2019s eliminating transaction and withdrawal limits for customers in all of the 150+ countries where Circle is available.\n\u201cOver the past year we\u2019ve worked closely with such forward-thinkers in the U.K. government and banking sector to bring this new social payment experience to U.K. consumers,\u201d said Circle co-founders Sean Neville and Jeremy Allaire. \u201cAs the first digital currency company in the world to be granted an e-money license, Circle will also offer the benefits of digital money to Europe\u2019s 500 million consumers, and ultimately enable anyone with sterling or euros to send and receive value for free and with an experience familiar to anyone who uses messaging or social media.\u201d\nThe move, and the envisaged extension to Circle customers all over Europe, is a godsend for the many users who wish to earn and spend Bitcoin without having to worry about the volatility of the digital currency. Though the Bitcoin exchange rates have been remarkably stable over the last few months, and some observers believe that the days of wild volatility are over, the fact remains that the more and more workers earning their wages (or part of their wages) in Bitcoin, with bills to pay and families to support, aren\u2019t able to tolerate volatility and need effective shields.\nThough often referred to as a \u201cBitcoin bank,\u201d Circle \u2012 which defines itself as \u201ca consumer Internet company transforming the world economy with secure, simple, and less costly technology for storing and using money\u201d \u2012 is not a bank. \u201cCircle is not a bank, and FDIC insurance does not protect you against the risk of our insolvency,\u201d says a Circle Help Center page. Also, Circle doesn\u2019t lend or leverage members\u2019 funds.\nHowever, it can be argued that, with the option for consumers of holding and spending funds in their local fiat currency, Circle is performing the most essential functions of a bank. The company is backed by $76 million in venture capital and counts Goldman Sachs among its investors.\n\u201cAt Circle, we envision a new experience for money that builds on the experiences and possibilities we have with messaging, social media, and other forms of communication and information sharing that billions of people have become accustomed to online,\u201d added Neville and Allaire. \u201cWe don\u2019t need bank branches; we have billions of smartphones as our distribution channel, our core product experience, and our customer service fulfillment channel. We don\u2019t need to employ thousands of compliance staff; we build machine learning algorithms and financial artificial intelligence to reduce risk and improve the experience of money. We ship new releases of our \u2018bank\u2019 every day and we\u2019re constantly iterating on the consumer experience of digital money.\u201d\nFortune notes that Barclays has become the first big British bank to form a partnership with Circle. Barclays Corporate Banking is providing the account that Circle needs to store sterling for consumers, and the infrastructure to allow transfers from any U.K. bank account in and out of Circle.\u00a0\n\u201cWe support the exploration of positive uses of blockchain that can benefit consumers and society,\u201d said a Barclays representative.\nThe move was welcomed by the U.K. Treasury, The Financial Times reports.\u201cCircle\u2019s decision to launch in the U.K., and the firm\u2019s new partnership with Barclays are major milestones,\u201d said U.K. Treasury economic secretary Harriett Baldwin. \u201cThey prove our decision to introduce the most progressive, forward-looking regulatory regime is paying off and cements our status as the world\u2019s Fin Tech capital.\u201d\nThe Financial Times emphasizes that blockchain technology permits exchanging money without using a bank clearing system. According to Allaire, the financial services industry did not fully realize the potential of the open-source blockchain, concentrating instead on developing its own closed versions based on similar technology. Circle is, instead, betting on the public Bitcoin blockchain.\nAccording to The New York Times, this is the first time that a large global bank has agreed to work with a Bitcoin company. \u201cThe announcement has the industry wondering if this is one of the turning points for the Internet of money,\u201d said Eric Van der Kleij, the head of Level39, a London-based firm that helps nurture fintech startups, as reported by Bloomberg Technology.\nIt appears that Circle\u2019s move to the U.K. has all the support it needs, from the financial and political establishment, to revolutionize consumer banking in the country. If Circle\u2019s plans for European expansion will go ahead with similar support from the banks and the authorities, the revolution could soon extend to the rest of Europe.", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 8}

It\u2019s worth noting that Masters, among others, expressed support for private, \u201cpermissioned\u201d non-Bitcoin blockchains, which seems to be the direction chosen by the Hyperdedger Project.\nTechnology giant Intel is a member of the Hyperledger Project.\u00a0\n\u201cBlockchain technology can help enable secure transfer of digital assets among known and unknown parties,\u201d said Imad Sousou, vice president and general manager of the Open Source Technology Center at Intel. \"Intel looks forward to collaborating with the Hyperledger Project to advance the security, scalability, and privacy of transactions in enterprise and permission-less systems.\u201d\nLast week, Intel published its plan to develop a distributed ledger, the \u201cSawtooth Lake\u201d platform, which promises to allow companies to run their own blockchain, providing a permanent digital record, International Business Times reports. Intel will submit the Sawtooth Lake code to the open-source Hyperledger Project.\nSawtooth Lake is a modular platform for building, deploying and running distributed ledgers. The platform supports customizable data models to capture the current state of the ledger, transaction languages to change the ledger state, and consensus methods to validate transactions.\u00a0\nSawtooth users are able to define their own custom \u201ctransaction family\u201d with data models and transaction languages tailored to their use case. To make initial development simpler, the Sawtooth platform comes with three built-in transaction families to implement frequent use cases and provide a ready-to-use ledger with a fully functional marketplace for digital assets.\nEndPointRegistry is a built-in transaction family for registering ledger services; IntegerKey is a transaction family used for testing deployed ledgers; and MarketPlace is a transaction family for buying, selling and trading digital assets.\nThe Sawtooth Lake platform provides two consensus protocols with different performance trade-offs. The first, called PoET for \u201cProof of Elapsed Time,\u201d is a lottery protocol that builds on Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) provided by Intel\u2019s Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to address the needs of large populations of participants. The second, Quorum Voting, is an adaptation of the Ripple and Stellar consensus protocols and serves to address the needs of applications that require immediate transaction finality.\nPoET uses a TEE such as SGX to ensure a safe, random and robust lottery function without the specialized hardware and high power required by most proof algorithms. Intel\u2019s approach is based on a guaranteed wait time provided through the TEE. According to Intel, the algorithm scales to thousands of participants and will run efficiently on any Intel processor that supports SGX.\nThe current release, still experimental, includes software which runs outside of SGX and simulates the behavior of the PoET algorithm.\u00a0\n\u201cIt does not provide security in this mode,\u201d notes Intel. \u201cThis project is intended for experimental usage and we recommend against using it for security sensitive applications.\u201d\nIn related news, IBM, another Hyperledger Project member, plans to combine blockchain\u2019s distributed ledger technology with its Artificial Intelligence system Watson for Internet of Things (IoT) applications.\nThe IoT seems the main interest of Intel as well. \u201cWhile Bitcoin is the most popular distributed ledger, the technology has been proposed for many different applications ranging from international remittance, insurance claim processing, supply chain management and the Internet of Things (IoT),\u201d notes the company.\nIn fact, while Internet payments aren\u2019t the main focus of Intel, the IoT is a strategic area of growing importance for the tech giant, and one which could certainly use the robustness and resiliency provided by distributed ledger technology.\u00a0\n\u201cThe Internet of Things (IoT) is fueling innovation in nearly every part of our lives,\u201d notes the Intel IoT website. \u201cWith the potential of thousands of new connected things bringing a tidal wave of new data, businesses want a better grasp of expected ROI, cost, and scalability, while IT managers struggle with integration, interoperability, and management concerns.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 11}

Inflation has always been the bane of many businesses and individuals alike.\u00a0\nOne thing is clear: something needs to be done.\nIf cryptocurrency, perhaps Bitcoin, was globally accepted as the world\u2019s reserve currency, how well could it manage inflation and provide transparency compared to the U.S. dollar,\u00a0arguably the world\u2019s primary reserve currency?\nThe world of fiat currency seems straightforward enough: Delegate monetary policy to those elected officials most capable of keeping a standardized and stable medium of exchange going.\nIn practice, however, things get complicated, and often the policies and the mechanisms to carry out the policies are convoluted and not as transparent as they could be.\nFor example, the Federal Reserve System (the Fed) attempts to manage inflation by using\u00a0open market operations,\u00a0the discount rate, and\u00a0reserve requirements, but this monetary system has not been able to reduce long-term inflation.\u00a0\nMuch of this instability in the money supply is due largely to the practice of fractional-reserve banking/lending by commercial banks and lenders and the Fed's imprecise, volatile way of increasing and decreasing the money supply by using bond transactions, discount rates and reserve requirements, which ultimately swings the economy and the money supply exponentially upwards or downwards.\nWith the current monetary system, regardless of how well the Fed tries to plan bond transactions, discount rates and reserve requirements to regulate the money supply, the practice of fractional-reserve banking/lending exponentially compounds the effects produced in response to even the slightest changes made to the money supply using the Fed's three primary monetary tools.\nCurrently the Fed\u2019s policy on fractional-reserves requires banks and lenders only to keep meager reserves ranging from 0 to 10 percent, which allows banks to create upwards of 90 percent of their money out of thin air.\nThink back to the movie \u201cDumb and Dumber\u201d with the suitcase once flush full of cash that Lloyd and Harry plan on returning to its owner \u2013 but they later ended up spending most of the money \u2013 leaving behind a pile of napkin IOUs instead.\u00a0\nOur current situation is similar to this, but worse; the banks/lenders create\u00a0upwards of 90 percent of their money by printing digital bank IOUs without there being any cash,\u00a0\u201cspecial\u201d Treasury Department/Federal Reserve IOUs, to back up all of the commercial banks\u2019/lenders\u2019 funds to begin with.\nAlso, the fact that banks can charge interest on monies created through this process and often require people to pledge real, tangible assets as collateral for these bank IOUs is another issue altogether. But for the purposes of this discussion, the volatility created through managing money in this way seems to ultimately result in rising long-term inflation.\nIn addition, considering the dollar is the primary world-reserve currency, this status creates a unique situation that allows the United States to print excess reserves beyond its domestic needs to help supply the international demand. The excess reserves created in this process can, in turn, potentially distort the very indexes used by the Fed to help manage the money supply, thereby creating a fairly unstable system for managing inflation in the long run.\u00a0\nPerhaps it is time to transition to an alternative medium of exchange that is more transparent and effectively manages short- and long-term inflation.\nCryptocurrency may be a solution to regain the value of our savings/earnings on a global scale.\nIf Bitcoin were accepted as the world\u2019s reserve currency, this could potentially create an environment that could curb inflation and introduce a moderate amount of favorable deflation until all 21 million bitcoin are eventually minted.\nIn fact, a small amount of deflation can actually be a good thing \u2013 as suggested by the Friedman rule \u2013 \u00a0and bitcoin would be deflationary until the fixed number of coins are finally minted over the course of time.\u00a0\nBecause Bitcoin is gradually minted at decreasing fixed rates determined every four years, it creates a deflationary effect, despite there actually being an increase in the money supply during this time which most traditional economists would recognize as a condition of inflation.\u00a0\nBut it is this fixed money supply that has the potential to move society forward as quickly as the original token system did that moved us out of the barter economy to something more efficient.\nAfter all the bitcoins are created, the only way for the deflationary effect to continue is if bitcoins are lost or destroyed, but the amount of bitcoins removed in this way would likely be minimal.\nAgain, with our Bitcoin example, the Bitcoin cryptocurrency approaches the currency distribution and management problem by codifying the rules in a mandatory consensus manner; the rules cannot be changed unless the majority of people decide to voluntarily run the new version of the Bitcoin protocol.\u00a0\nPut simply, the people who secure the Bitcoin network, the \u201cminers,\u201d and use bitcoin to exchange goods and services, can each decide which version of the Bitcoin program they want to run. If people decide they don\u2019t agree with the latest changes made to the Bitcoin protocol, they can run the version of the protocol that has the features they agree with, and the world will continue to do business as usual.\nIn a sense, it\u2019s a form of direct democracy: Votes are cast through the sheer action of choosing which version of the Bitcoin program to run.\nIn Bitcoin and other open-source cryptocurrencies, zero will never equal one; the software code can be audited at any time, creating an unrivaled level of transparency on the mechanisms of monetary policy.\u00a0\nCryptocurrencies that have a finite money supply have the potential to become a safe haven that staves off long-term inflation for good, offering a new alternative to how people actually do savings and business.", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 7}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nJim Rickards, the New York Times best-selling author of Currency Wars and The Death of Money, recently discussed his latest book, The New Case for Gold, during a reinvent.money hangout. Although the majority of the conversation focused on Rickards\u2019 new book, the economic commentator also shared some thoughts on Bitcoin.\nAnything Can Be Money\nIn recent interviews, Rickards has mentioned Bitcoin as a legitimate form of money and said on the reinvent.money hangout that, in fact, anything can be money.\u00a0\nHe stated:\n\n\u201cAt various times in history, feathers have been money, shells have been money, dollars and euros are money, Bitcoin is money, gold is money, and silver is money. There are many different kinds of money.\u201d\n\nRickards also took issue with the idea that some forms of money, such as Bitcoin or U.S. dollars, are not backed by anything.\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not true,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are backed by one thing, which is confidence. If you and I have confidence that something is money and we agree that it\u2019s money, then it can be money.\u201d\nAlthough Rickards believes anything can be money, he went on to describe how some forms of money are better than others (in the eyes of the market.)\nThe Viability of a Money is Determined by the Market\nRickards explained that the viability of any form of money is determined by the people who use it (or don\u2019t use it). He stated, \u201cThe question is: Will anyone have confidence in it? Same thing with Bitcoin; same thing with gold.\u201d\nRickards then added, \u201cI can call something money, but if nobody else in the world wants it, then it\u2019s not very useful as money.\u201d\nAs Rickards explained, people can decide to use anything as money. Having said that, there are still properties of some assets that make them more useful as money than others. Attributes such as portability, divisibility, fungibility and others are often pointed to as properties of good money.\nGovernments Have an Advantage with Their Money\nOne of Rickards\u2019 key points is that governments hold a major advantage over free market alternatives.\n\u201cGovernments have an edge because they can make you pay taxes in their money,\u201d he said.\nPut another way, governments essentially create an artificial use case for their own forms of paper money by threatening people with punishment if they do not pay taxes, which are denominated in the government\u2019s own fiat currency, to the government.\nAlthough governments benefit from this advantage, it hasn\u2019t stopped many forms of government money from facing a loss in confidence over the years. Specifically, Rickards point out the Weimar Republic (Germany), Zimbabwe, Argentina and present-day Venezuela as examples of fiat currency crises.\nRickards Still Prefers Gold\nRickards has had some kind things to say about Bitcoin recently, but he\u2019s still not convinced it\u2019s a better alternative to gold. He pointed out in the interview one of his main issues with digital currencies:\n\n\u201cBitcoin is digital. If the power grid goes down, your bitcoins are worthless. I\u2019m not anti-Bitcoin ... but physical gold does not have the disabilities of Bitcoin and digital currencies like the [U.S.] dollar.\u201d\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nZooko Wilcox-O\u2019Hearn found the cypherpunks mailing list when he was 19. Since then, he has been lucky enough to work on cypherpunk-oriented technologies for most of his adult life. Currently, Zooko is the CEO of Zcash, which is a truly anonymous alternative to Bitcoin.\nZooko was recently interviewed on Epicenter Bitcoin, and he shared some of his thoughts related to the recent revival of the cypherpunk movement. In his view, Bitcoin has given this technological revolution new life.\nWho Are the Cypherpunks?\nThe definition of a cypherpunk tends to vary based on whom you ask, but the generally accepted definition of a cypherpunk is anyone who uses strong cryptography in an effort to enact social or political change.\u00a0\nThe cypherpunks first came to prominence via the cypherpunks mailing list in the \u201890s.\nDuring his recent Epicenter Bitcoin interview, Zooko described what happened when he first stumbled upon the cypherpunks mailing list:\n\n\u201cI became exposed to all kinds of grandiose visions of how the combination of the Internet plus cryptography plus those two things becoming widely available to billions of people could have all kinds of fantastic consequences.\u201d\n\nCypherpunk philosophy is perhaps best described by former Intel senior scientist Timothy C. May in The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto. In the manifesto from 1992, May writes:\n\n\u201cThese developments will alter completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust and reputation.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Is a Cypherpunk\u2019s Dream\nA workable form of digital cash has always been on the minds of the cypherpunks. During the \u201890s, much of the activity on the mailing list was associated with various schemes for digital cash systems. Zooko discussed this point during the interview:\n\n\u201cThe development of Bitcoin was a breakthrough that a lot of the cypherpunks, including me, had dreamed of from the beginning \u2012 where the beginning is like 1993 or so \u2012 and couldn\u2019t figure out how to make that dream real until Satoshi [Nakamoto] came up with it.\u201d\n\nThe fact that so many cypherpunks had failed to create a useable form of digital cash for so many years is part of the reason many of them were skeptical of Bitcoin when it was first announced by Nakamoto. For example, Blockstream President Adam Back was one of the first people Satoshi emailed about his Bitcoin white paper, but the hashcash inventor did not get involved with the digital currency until much later.\nZooko talked about his own struggles with developing digital cash schemes during his Epicenter Bitcoin interview.\u00a0\n\u201cI struggled for maybe 12 or 14 years to come up with something like Bitcoin, and I couldn\u2019t figure out any way to make it work,\u201d he said.\nHow Bitcoin Revived the Cypherpunks\nZooko also explained how the philosophies of the cypherpunks were dying off before the creation of Bitcoin. He talked about how, at times, he thought he was the only cypherpunk left in the world. He added:\n\n\u201cThere was a widespread narrative that privacy is dead and no one cares. That\u2019s what was, from my perspective, completely upended by the Bitcoin phenomenon.\u201d\n\nIn Zooko\u2019s mind, Bitcoin changed the view of what is technically possible in the world today. This new technology has breathed new life into the cypherpunk movement. Zooko concluded:\n\n\u201c[Satoshi\u2019s] breakthrough about what\u2019s technically possible combined with the community of Bitcoiners who were motivated emotionally, politically and morally to invest in it and make it important to their lives \u2012 that is what sort of revived the whole cypherpunk revolution in my experience.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

Now, however, it seems as though its rise in popularity is due to continue in the the United Kingdom after a new report found that a fifth of U.K. employees believe that their organizations will be accepting Bitcoin and similar digital currencies as payment by 2020.\nThe study, Beyond Digital, by Infomentum looked at the feedback from 1,000 office workers examining how they believe office technology is set to evolve over the next few years. According to the report, during the past five years digital transformation and technological change have seen companies rethink the way they do business, whether on or offline.\nIn 2014, Infomentum produced a report titled Generating Success with Generation C, enabling businesses to understand the expectations of the connected customer and how those expectations were making their way into the workplace. In 2015, a report called Talking Transformation was released, looking at how CEOs could restructure their organizations before the market disrupted them.\nThis latest report is aimed at helping businesses look beyond digital transformation as it focuses on what else Generation C \u2012 made up of young, tech savvy consumers \u2012 wants over the next few years, enabling businesses to prepare their organizations for 2020 based on the analysis and views from leading experts.\nAccording to the report, 91 percent of employees don\u2019t believe that their employer will remain competitive in 2020 in their current form, with 50 percent believing that their employers need to invest in new IT equipment to remain competitive.\nIn addition, 14 percent of employees would like to see drone deliveries introduced by 2020 while 16 percent of office workers are hopeful that 3D printed \u201cproduct downloads\u201d will be possible by 2020. Contactless mobile payment is predicted to become the principal payment method in the next few years.\nIt\u2019s interesting to note how much of an impact Bitcoin is having on the digital world as more companies consider its attributes and how it can make a positive difference for countless companies in the years ahead.

Todd was asked if he is still worried about the possibly negative implications of a controversial hard fork induced by Bitcoin Classic or any other alternative Bitcoin client. said he is still worried about a hard fork due to some larger block size limit supporters who seem willing to \u201cfork Bitcoin at all costs.\u201d\n\nSome Big Blockers Will Not Back Down\nWhen Todd was first asked how he felt about his hard fork worries, he brought up the fact that some parts of the Bitcoin community seem ready to fork the blockchain no matter what. He stated:\n\n\u201cI would say I\u2019m still very worried because I think we still have a contingent of people in this community whose views are: Let\u2019s fork Bitcoin at all costs, we desperately need this block size increase, and we\u2019re going to need a couple more immediately.\u201d\n\nTodd said this is the general view that he feels Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Blockchain CEO Peter Smith have expressed to him in his conversations.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think these people are going to necessarily back down lightly,\u201d Todd said.\nWhy a Hard Fork Could End Badly\nWith the current climate around the debate and the intention of some people to hard fork Bitcoin without near-universal consensus, Todd said there is a small chance this process could go badly.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen I say \u2018badly\u2019, I essentially mean that we end up with two different economically relevant currencies,\u201d he said. \u201cYou end up getting some miners on one coin and some miners on another.\u201d\nFactom CEO Paul Snow, who was also present during the conversation on The Crypto Show, disagreed with Todd a bit and said the chances of something going badly were \u201cvanishingly small.\u201d In the past, Bitcoin Classic developer Gavin Andresen has written about his thoughts on the possibility of something going wrong during a hard fork with 75 percent support from Bitcoin miners. Todd has also countered some of Andresen\u2019s arguments.\nWhen pushed further by Snow on why he thinks the chances of something going wrong may be higher than others think, Todd pointed out that some members of the community may be ready to pay Bitcoin miners to run alternative software and force a hard fork.\u00a0\nTodd said:\n\n\u201cI happen to know that people have been talking to miners and saying, \u2018What\u2019s your price?\u2019 What would it take to rent the hashing power needed to force a fork? When you\u2019re talking about scenarios like that, you\u2019re talking about companies with enough money to \u2012 at least temporarily \u2012 just say, \u2018All right. We\u2019re going to support mining. We\u2019re going to make sure this fork can happen from a technical perspective. Yet, those may not be the ingredients for long-term success.\u201d\n\nTodd also pointed to claims from former Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn regarding the use of checkpoints to force a hard fork without majority support from miners. Todd added, \u201cThere are a lot of options people have, and the fact that people are considering these options means that the chances of [a hard fork going badly] are not infinitesimally small.\u201d\nTodd went on to clarify that the small chance of something going wrong could be quantified as a roughly 5 percent chance, although he mentioned better odds earlier in the interview.\nHard Forks Need to Be Done in the Right Scenarios\nOne of Todd\u2019s points on a contentious hard fork had to do with the large amount of money raised by some Bitcoin companies, which garnered some laughs from the show\u2019s hosts:\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of crazy people in this world, and some of them have a lot of VC funding. It\u2019s not implausible that some of these companies will do crazy things.\u201d\n\nTodd\u2019s final point on the matter was that hard forks need to take place in the right environments. He concluded, \u201cIt behooves us to make sure that any hard fork triggers in a scenario where it is very unlikely for any of this to happen . . . Triggering at 75 percent hashing power is not that scenario.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nThe Lightning Network is viewed by many as a serious improvement for Bitcoin in terms of scalability, but there are still plenty of critics of the system who do not believe it is destined for success. During a recent event at the Coinbase offices in San Francisco, Lightning Network co-creators Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja answered some questions about potential weaknesses of this generalized network for payment channels.\nOne of the key criticisms Dryja and Poon attempted to debunk during the event was that bitcoins are essentially \u201ctied-up\u201d once they enter the Lightning Network. Poon was the first of the duo to respond to this potentially negative aspect of the network. He stated, \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily tied up in the sense that they can [still] spend it.\u201d\nBitcoins on the Lightning Network are Useful\nDryja took Poon\u2019s point to another level by pointing out that, in certain situations, bitcoins on the Lightning Network may actually be more useful than those on the Bitcoin blockchain. Dryja explained:\n\n\u201cIt is tied up, as in it\u2019s in this channel, but the thing is, having funds in channels that are on this network might be more useful than having a non-Lightning bitcoin because you can push it anywhere instantly.\u201d\n\nWhile on-chain transactions require confirmations before they\u2019re considered secure, transactions on the Lightning Network are essentially settled instantly. According to Dryja and Poon, on-chain transactions are also expected to be much more expensive than Lightning transactions once the system goes live.\nThe belief that funds are tied up on the Lightning Network comes from a misunderstanding of how the system works. In the past, some have wondered whether opening a payment channel with Uber would be useful if you don\u2019t use that particular car service often. This misses the point that the Lightning Network is a generalized platform for payment channels, which means users are able to route payments to practically anyone else on the network.\nDryja used the Uber example to make this point:\n\n\u201cCustomer opens a channel with Coinbase and then Coinbase has a channel open with Uber, and so when they want to pay Uber, they just say, \u2018Hey, Coinbase. Please forward this to Uber.\u2019 One channel is enough to pay everyone, really.\u201d\n\nA user on the Lightning Network needs only to open up a channel with one other user to gain access to millions of others.\u00a0However, the vision is that users will have multiple channels open by default to gain access to the entire network.\nWhen Are Your Funds Actually Locked Up?\nAlthough funds aren\u2019t necessarily tied-up all the time on the Lightning Network, there are still instances where things can go wrong (though not completely wrong).\u00a0\nPoon explained:\n\n\u201cThe only situation where there is this structure where it feels locked up is if your channel counterparty is not really online all that much or doesn\u2019t want to route, which is why there is that cost if you want to be a \u2018hub\u2019 \u2012 because you\u2019re likely to get more of those types of users. It is costly to be that, and that\u2019s why there is that disincentive to operate in that way.\u201d\n\nIn other words, if someone who is supposed to be routing payments for you decides they don\u2019t want to do that anymore, they can deny your ability to send transactions on the Lightning Network. This would force you to close the channel, which could lock up your funds for a period of time. As Poon mentioned, there is a disincentive to act this way because you have to make some bitcoins available on the network to be able to route payments in the first place.\nHow Coinbase Can Help in the Early Days\nPoon also talked about how Coinbase can help with user adoption of the Lightning Network in the early days. He noted that funds on the Lightning Network can be used to make on-blockchain transactions \u2012 albeit with the help of a third party.\u00a0\nPoon explained:\n\n\u201cYou make the payment inside Lightning. You send it to Coinbase, and then Coinbase makes the on-chain transaction on their behalf. What happens is, at that point, the user is trusting Coinbase to some marginal level.\u201d\n\nPoon added that this sort of functionality would be helpful during the early days of the network when not everyone is already on board. He also stated that Coinbase would be well-suited to act as a bridge between the Lightning Network and the blockchain during this period of time. The only limitation with this setup is that doing extremely low-value \u201cdust\u201d transfers from the Lightning Network to the blockchain would not work.\n\u00a0\nUpdate: This article has been modified from its original version to clarify that the vision for the Lightning Network is to have each user open multiple channels to gain access to the entire network.\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

More than 50 outstanding developers and entrepreneurs competed in the second annual Bay BitHack, held at the Innovation Lab at the University of California, Berkeley on April 2-3. They were challenged to build applications of the future of the way we look at money.\nThe event was hosted through a partnership of the Bitcoin Association of Berkeley, the Lester Center for Entrepreneurship, the Blockchain Education Network and Major League Hacking.\u00a0\nAndrew Tu, director of Bay Bithack, told Bitcoin Magazine that the mission of the event was \u201cto educate students about Bitcoin and blockchain technology, foster cryptocurrency-related innovation in the Bay Area, and grow the local Bitcoin ecosystem.\u201d The goal is in line with the three principles of the Bitcoin Association of Berkeley, headed by fellow Berkeley student Max Fang.\u00a0\nThe event was similar to the one last year except that it changed location, from the Sutardja Dai Hall last year to the Berkeley-Haas Innovation Lab inside Memorial Stadium. This year the university's business school was also represented and there were additional funding, mentorship and support to projects that are built by Berkeley-Haas students.\nThe morning of the event began with workshops designed to help individuals and teams clarify their ideas and to teach important skills for blockchain technology development. Fang\u2019s presentation focused on what Bitcoin and the blockchain were to clarify students\u2019 understanding. Paul Puey, CEO of Airbitz, and Josh Cincinnati from BlockCypher presented and explained their companies\u2019 API.\u00a0\nHacking began on April 2 at 12:30 a.m. and continued all night, or as late as teams wished to continue, until the next day at 12:30 p.m. Team demonstrations and an awards ceremony followed.\nStudents designed a loyalty app for stores using Bitcoin, an insurance platform using shared consensus and the blockchain, an application for people to exchange loose change for bitcoins, among other projects. The winning team was two high school students who designed a betting and prediction platform for League of Legends using the blockchain.\nHacks were judged by a panel of experts, based on originality, functionality and a \u201cwow factor\u201d that makes the project stand out above and beyond. There were no requirements for teams, except that everyone who participated be a student.\n\"Schools hosting large Bitcoin events are a huge deal,\u201d Dean Masley, executive director of the Blockchain Education Network, said in a statement to Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWhat most people don't realize is that blockchain is an incredibly nascent industry with talent being less than seven years experience at the very most. Annual events give local communities the infrastructure to build their local interest groups into influential hubs of this new industry. By dedicating resources to draw in talent, schools like Berkeley are leading the way for other schools to create blockchain institutions of their own to further this socio-economic experiment.\u201d\nTu explained to Bitcoin Magazine that \u201chaving MLH as a partner helped establish Bay BitHack as a legitimate hackathon, because MLH is the official university hackathon league that sanctions just about every major hackathon event in North America.\u201d\nTo be inclusive of everyone, the club chose to keep the event free and funded by corporate sponsors, all of which are technology startups in the Bitcoin and blockchain space. Coinbase, a Bitcoin wallet and exchange based in San Francisco, is the title sponsor of the event.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nSince its launch,\u00a0Bitcoin Classic's node count has steadily increased. The latest release of the alternative Bitcoin implementation even\u00a0topped the charts, with almost 3,000 Bitcoin Classic 0.12 nodes reachable on the network.\nBut a closer look at these statistics reveal some odd details.\nFirst,\u00a0IP-data suggests that many Bitcoin Classic nodes might not really be many Bitcoin Classic nodes at all. Instead, a single node could use multiple IP addresses to spoof total node count. This possibility appears more likely in light of the observation that\u00a0very few Bitcoin Classic nodes seem to be replacing existing Bitcoin Core nodes, indicating that these are new nodes, rather than node operators\u00a0actually make the switch.\u00a0\nThat said, it is theoretically possible that many new users are simply firing up (and shutting down) Bitcoin Classic nodes in the same geographical area simultaneously.\nHowever, it is certain that a lion\u2019s share of all Bitcoin Classic nodes are hosted in data centers, predominantly by Amazon Web Services and\u00a0Choopa. That's unsurprising, as\u00a0dedicated websites offer such services, and\u00a0this practice is encouraged by Bitcoin Classic supporters. Recent\u00a0data analysis, moreover, shows that a vast majority of nodes in these data centers are almost certainly paid for by a relatively small group of people.\nThis raises the question: Is it useful to run full nodes from data centers at all? Does the sharp increase of Bitcoin Classic nodes in any way benefit Bitcoin, Bitcoin Classic or both?\nLet\u2019s take a look at why anyone would want to run a full node.\nValidation\nPerhaps the most important reason to operate a full node is validation.\nWith a full node, users can check whether transactions are valid according to all of Bitcoin's rules. Using nothing but the open source software, node operators can verify that any bitcoins they receive are legitimately mined, correctly signed and more. This is what makes Bitcoin a trustless solution.\nThis also makes validation a popular yardstick for decentralization, embodied in the \u201ccost of node-operation.\u201d As it is cheaper to validate, more people can do it, which means Bitcoin\u2019s decentralization is increased.\nPlus, if a user can validate with his own full node, there\u2019s a privacy benefit, as there is no need to share address information with any third party.\nTechnically, however, these arguments hold up only when the node is actually at the physical location of its operator. If a user needs to trust a data center to feed correct information from the node, the solution is theoretically no longer really trustless. Though, admittedly, in practice users always trust hardware and software to a certain extent; trusting a data center might be an acceptible risk for most.\nPerhaps more importantly, therefore: Validation really serves a genuine purpose only when used to verify incoming transactions. Many\u00a0Bitcoin nodes operated from data centers, however, aren't used for\u00a0transacting at all, and, therefore, don\u2019t provide the benefits concerning validation.\nConclusion: Operating a Bitcoin Classic node\u00a0from a data center provides questionable validation if it\u2019s used for transacting, and no meaningful validation whatsoever if it\u2019s not.\nConsensus\nOverlapping with the previous point (but harder to measure), full nodes also influence Bitcoin's networked consensus process.\nA full node adds \u201cweight\u201d to the set of rules it applies: Whoever wants to transact with that node (and the operator behind it) will need to adhere to its rules. As more nodes apply the same rules, these rules are \u201cstrengthened\u201d through their collective network effect.\nThis might be the main reason many Bitcoin Classic nodes are coming online. They serve as a type of vote, signaling that users are willing to switch to a 2-megabyte block size limit.\nHowever, insofar the Bitcoin network has anything resembling votes, these are not counted per node. Instead, nodes essentially \u201cvote\u201d through their economic \u201cweight.\u201d As the operator behind a node offers more value to the network \u2013 think of important merchants, big buyers, large exchanges and more \u2013 their economic weight increases.\nThis means it makes no difference how many nodes someone runs; whether an important merchant uses one node or one hundred, his total economic weight doesn't change. And, therefore, his influence in Bitcoin\u2019s networked consensus process doesn\u2019t change either.\nAnd again, most nodes operated from data centers probably don't add any economic weight at all. They are not actually used for transacting.\nConclusion: Operating Bitcoin Classic\u00a0nodes from data centers does not provide any meaningful weight to Bitcoin\u2019s consensus process if it\u2019s not used for transacting. It could add weight if it is used for transacting, but running more than one node per economic entity is pointless for consensus.\nDecentralization\nOther than cost of node operation, another popular yardstick to measure decentralization is the\u00a0amount of doors that need to be knocked on to control or shut down Bitcoin.\nSince full nodes serve as Bitcoin's backbone, it's beneficial to have many of them online ... but only if they are operated by many different people as well, and preferably in distant georaphical regions.\nIf more than one node is operated from a single data center, it\u2019s the operator of that data center who has ultimate control over all of them. As such, only one door needs to be knocked on to control all nodes in that data center.\nConclusion: Operating more than one Bitcoin Classic\u00a0node per data center does not provide any meaningful decentralization.\nRelaying\nPerhaps the most important task of a full node, from a technical network perspective, is relaying transactions and blocks to other nodes.\nMoreover, if many nodes are controlled by few people, or are all at the same physical location, this effectively presents a single point of failure. If these nodes represent a significant chunk of the Bitcoin network, and suddenly disappear offline or start relaying corrupted data, it could even be a temporarily destabilizing factor.\nHowever, there is a scenario in which running nodes from data centers could serve a purpose. If a Bitcoin Classic hard fork happens, but almost no non-Classic nodes switch to accept bigger blocks, the Bitcoin Classic nodes operated in data centers could help relay these blocks to nodes that do accept them. As such, running Bitcoin Classic nodes even before a hard fork occurs, could signal to miners that their potential bigger blocks will be relayed. (That said, miners would presumably be more worried about the split in the network in the first place, rather than relay-potential in case of such a split.)\nConclusion: Operating Bitcoin Classic nodes\u00a0from data centers does not currently provide any meaningful contribution to Bitcoin\u2019s relay process, and could even pose a small risk. There exists a scenario in which operating Bitcoin Classic nodes from data centers could slightly help Bitcoin Classic, but this advantage seems mostly theoretical.\nBootstrapping\nWhenever a new Bitcoin node comes online, it needs to sync with the rest of the network. This requires the node to download (and verify) the complete blockchain, for which it needs to connect to fully synced nodes. Running a node from a data center can help.\nIn this case, however, many of the new\u00a0Bitcoin Classic nodes operated from data centers have blockchain pruning enabled. They get rid of all blockchain data older than a couple of days. As such, they are no use to syncing nodes.\nThe Bitcoin Classic nodes that don\u2019t have blockchain pruning enabled do upload blockchain data to syncing nodes. But that was never really a bottleneck or a problem in need of solving. And if it ever becomes a problem, it will be easy to take care of, indeed by spinning up full nodes from data centers.\nConclusion: Operating Bitcoin Classic nodes\u00a0from data centers could serve some useful data to syncing nodes, but network health benefits are negligible.\u200b\nSPV Hosts\nLast, full nodes serve as hosts for Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) clients, such as mobile wallet apps. Since SPV clients don't store the entire blockchain themselves, they connect to full nodes that do, and request the data they need.\nHowever, the Bitcoin nodes including the new Bitcoin Classic nodes\u00a0that have blockchain pruning enabled are of limited use for SPV nodes, since they might not be able to provide all data requested.\nMoreover, hosting SPV clients was never really a bottleneck or a problem in need of solving either. And if it ever becomes a problem, it will be easy to take care of.\nConclusion: Operating Bitcoin Classic nodes \u00a0from data centers could serve some useful data to SPV nodes, but network health benefits are negligible.\u200b\n\u00a0\nThanks to James Hilliard and Blocktrail CTO Ruben de Vries for added suggestions.", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 24}

", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/the-bank-of-england-s-rscoin-an-experiment-for-central-banks-or-a-bitcoin-alternative-1459183955/", "birthday": "Mar 28, 2016  12:52 PM EST", "date": "2016-03-28 17:52:00", "content": "This is a guest post by Leah Zitter.\nOn February 21, 2016, the Bank of England reported that it had partnered with researchers at \u00a0University College in London to produce RSCoin, a digital currency designed for central bankers.\u00a0\nSarah Meiklejohn and George Danezis, two students from University College, created RSCoin which, they announced, offered a protocol superior to that of Bitcoin. The researchers said their work was a response to Bitcoin\u2019s limited transaction throughput, which is capped at around \u00a0seven transactions per second today based on the 1 megabyte block size limit and current network conditions. In comparison, credit card payments networks like Visa are able to process around 7,000 transactions per second.\nBitcoin Magazine talked to Andreas M. Antonopoulos, author of Mastering Bitcoin, about RSCoin and centralized digital currencies.\nDigital Currency Not a Winner-Takes-All Domain\nAlthough developers are currently debating the best way to increase Bitcoin scalability, other researchers have tried to tackle the problem by plotting alternate or additional decentralized systems that would lighten the load. However, none of these systems has been properly tested to date and all fail to produce high transaction volumes says G\u00fcn Sirer, hacker and professor at Cornell University.\nMeiklejohn and Danezis argue that RSCoin is the first type of digital currency that pivots around a central network.\u00a0\nThey noted that their system was more scalable in that it \u201ccan process over 2,000 transactions per second\u201d and that \u00a0\u201cmost transactions take less than one second to clear, as compared to many minutes in traditional cryptocurrency designs.\u201d \u00a0Meanwhile, Ben Broadbent, the Bank of England's deputy governor, told the London School of Economics that a centralized digital currency could strengthen the financial system.\nAntonopoulos disagrees:\n\n\u201cI find it to be a hyperbolic claim that RSCoin will replace or void Bitcoin. First of all, the new currency domain is not a winner-takes-all domain and has no monopoly status like national currencies do. Secondly, Bitcoin's design is intended to solve problems that are entirely different from the problems RScoin is designed to solve. The two systems fit in completely separate niches and serve completely different audiences.\u201d\n\nHe continued:\u00a0\n\n\u201cI see no reason why a Bitcoin user would be interested in RScoin or vice-versa. Bitcoin offers censorship resistance, open access, borderless commerce, permissionless innovation, network neutrality and strong immutability. RScoin has none of those features, replacing the network-centric trustless and decentralized model with a centralized authority. Anyone who wants centralized authority has no interest in Bitcoin.\u201d\u00a0\n\nWill RSCoin Help the Banks?\nBanks have long disagreed over whether Bitcoin will help them. Taking the Bank of England as an instance, Broadbent told\u00a0The Guardian that a digital-style currency would be bad for loans and may even threaten financial stability in the U.K. But a centralized RSCoin, Broadbent believes, could benefit retail payments and stabilize the financial system.\u00a0\nSays Antonopoulos:\n\n\u201cBitcoin's disruption to banking comes from the fact that it removes intermediaries and barriers to entry, reducing the cost of participation and providing neutrality of transport of value. RSCoin may be more palatable to banks, but it does nothing to dampen the disruption caused by a completely different approach to global finance as offered by Bitcoin.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn other words, banks may prefer RSCoin precisely because banks can have control over the digital currency \u00e2\u20ac\u2019 but initial problems remain.\nAntonopoulos elaborated: \u201cRSCoin is business as usual, dressed up as innovation, by emulating the least interesting features of Bitcoin. When the Internet came out, phone companies initially countered by introducing video-telephony and full-color faxing. RSCoin is the full-color-fax equivalent to Bitcoin's Internet of Money.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 28}

He runs an\u00a0online learning solutions company, Theory Frames, and has taught about Bitcoin and blockchain at the\u00a0National Academy of Legal Studies and Research\u00a0in\u00a0Hyderabad, India.\nThe global monetary system has reached a unique point in its history. The money that defines it is undergoing a serious shift.\u00a0\nAt one time, there were nearly 200 national currencies, with the current figure just above 180. For a national currency to become global money, it has to undergo conversion to other currencies at the prevailing exchange rate. And outside its national borders, it is subject to the laws of supply and demand. A Bangladeshi taka would rarely be demanded on the global market as compared to the U.S. dollar. So for the global population, labor output is not measured in reference to any actual universal money, but by the power centers of different political regimes.\u00a0\nThis notion of fiat money has dominated the entire 20th century and continued to do so in the first decade of 21st century, until the emergence of Bitcoin. There was no political subjectivity involved in Bitcoin; it was based on the mathematical design of issuing currency as well as settling payment transactions through a continuously updating chain of distributed ledgers called the blockchain.\u00a0\nBitcoin successfully solves the issue of double-spend that is a typical problem of digital money. It was quickly accepted by people because it was money, a payment rail and a messaging system all-in-one. It ensured both privacy as well as the security of a unique digital signature to every user without depending upon any intermediary.\u00a0\nIn less than eight years since its emergence, Bitcoin has grown to nearly 10 million user wallets, a daily transaction range of more than 200,000 and a market cap of more than $6 billion and rising.\u00a0\nIt's not just Bitcoin; this math-driven logic of currency has been improved by many others, and there are now more than 600 Bitcoin-like currencies. Four of these have market caps of $100 million, 10 have market caps of over $10 million, more than 50 have over $1 million and more than 150 have over $100,000.\u00a0\nNot only is this market cap of new currencies rising, but their daily transaction graph is increasing. It is expected that by 2020, there will be more than a billion cryptocurrency transactions per day as smartphone sales show a volume of 4 million units per day.\u00a0\nA world where everybody can send free email or SMS to every other human being on earth would also expect a currency that follows similar ease of transfer. That is where a politically fragmented notion of money faces a serious challenge of evolution.\nBut to go from a cash-based issuance system to a global seamless payment system requires a big political jump. It would require nations to raise their \u201cinteraction capacity\u201d to the equivalent level of the permissionless regime of Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies. That is what is confusing central banks and presenting them with three big dilemmas, the answers to which will determine their futures.\nThe First Dilemma: Equaling the Reliability of Cash\nAll central banks have issued a large amount of cash to their populations. For example, Reserve Bank of India has created a monetary base of more than 15 trillion rupees to date. This cash component makes up nearly 12 percent of the total money supply at present.\u00a0\nPeople trust this cash because this is the best notion of a bearer asset they have at present. Currencies working within borders are fungible as well as anonymous, and they are backed by statutory guarantee.\u00a0\nSome currencies are acceptable abroad, too. In such a case, the problem is how to recover this huge amount of cash and to replace it with a digital vault of cash. It would mean the creation of an equally reliable digital infrastructure of currency issuance and payment infrastructure. It would require that not only every citizen have a smartphone or a mobile digital device, but that he or she should also be in a position of using it with efficiency.\u00a0\nIn a country with more than 1.2 billion people, this is a huge challenge. It would require that country to have a highly authentic register of citizens\u2019 digital identities. And not just that \u2013 the issues of privacy need to be sorted out before people can be convinced to shift to a digital payment infrastructure.\u00a0\nEven a small country such as Sweden that has nearly replaced cash with a digital payment system doesn't expect to do away with cash completely before 2025. Eliminating higher denomination currency notes has proved to be a very difficult task for central banks. The currency printing and distribution cost alone for RBI has been the equivalent of more than $5 billion for the years 2014-15.\u00a0\nIf you add bank branches\u2019 management costs, the overall inefficiency of the system brings with it a huge burden of maintaining the legacy structure of cash. The desire to go cashless has good intentions, but having citizens accept it as easily as they have accepted Facebook is a dream that may not become reality for most countries.\nThe Second Dilemma: Non-workable Structures\nThe second fundamental issue is the existing structure of deposit and credit systems.\u00a0\nThis model works with a central bank-commercial bank binary system. The central bank issues money, but a commercial bank extends it to the population through its branches and ATM network.\u00a0\nA common bank does not interact with a central bank at all. A bank branch is the only connecting link between a customer and a central bank. A central bank is like the operating system, and a branch-led commercial bank network is the hardware.\u00a0\nThese two constitute the banking system, but there is a serious problem with this hardware. It was built during the time when a central bank could not reach a customer directly. So the lending, as well as the deposit function, was leased to a bank branch.\nBut this branch-driven system has aggregated a lot of hubris. It stretches the system through survival pangs as well as debt overhang. In the last four monetary policy steps, RBI has decreased the bank repo rate by 125 basis points, but the banks have transferred only 60 basis points to the end-user who needs funds.\u00a0\nIn India, the result is a sustained phase of stagnation in the economy. Within this binary, a central bank is proving to be only half-effective because it has to carry its bedfellow, commercial banks.\u00a0\nThe situation is even worse than that. Continuing with the example of India, public sector banks have a huge overload of non-performing as well as stressed assets. The market value of these banks is much less than their liabilities. The problem is aggravated by the rise in the number of willful defaulters.\u00a0\nThis poses a serious statutory risk to the monetary system, too. RBI has tried to bypass this issue by designing a new category of payment-only banks. It has given licenses to 11 new entities, half of which are telecom and payment app players. These banks may sort out the deposit and payment aspect, but the credit aspect remains unsolved.\nThe Third Dilemma: When to Issue\nThe Chinese central bank governor has announced plans to issue that bank's own digital currency, but no time frame and monetary design have been announced. Will it be a permissionless currency focusing on the privacy of the users, or will it be permissioned currency centered on the social order and security of the people?\u00a0\nWill it ensure complete convertibility to other cryptocurrencies or will there be controls on that? Will it pursue a proof-of-work model or will it pursue proof-of-stake model or a hybrid of the two? What kind of dilution of monetary sovereignty will it tolerate because of the Triffin dilemma, in which short-term domestic objectives conflict with long-term international plans?\u00a0\nWill it establish a single payment terminal for all the citizens and bypass the separate bank terminals? Will it allow direct issuance of money through direct download of digital wallets or will it partner with banks? Will it be issued only to taxpayers? Will it be rationed through monthly or weekly issuance?\u00a0\nEven if these issues are resolved, the big challenge is when this digital currency would be issued.\u00a0 Will it wait for universal adoption of smartphones? Will it make free Internet availability a mandatory feature of its state system?\u00a0\nAll these questions are not only important for China, but are critical for every central bank. This is a step that would require a historical jump on the part of political elites. It is easier said than done. The realm of math-driven currencies is a totally new ballgame, and political design may not work well within the straightjacket of such a new paradigm.\nOne experiment now in the works is the Sistema de Dinero Electr\u00f3nico (electronic money system) of Ecuador that replaced physical cash with digital money as of January 2015. But this is neither a new digital currency nor the digital equivalent of a cash-like bearer asset. All money is with the central database of government. So it is a domain of pull-payment and not push-payment like that of Bitcoin. Privacy concerns related to digital identity have been raised, but the Ecuadorian government has so far ignored them. It has banned the use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as well.\u00a0\nIn a population of 16 million where 40 percent of all people are unbanked, the Ecuadorian shift is going to take a long time for full implementation, particularly among the older and illiterate. It is like an official version of M-Pesa that succeeded in Kenya and some other parts of Africa. But even after one year, the Ecuadorian system is yet to become a popular choice. Not even 10 percent of the population has adopted it. Ecuador has a turbulent monetary history and it lives now with the U.S. dollar as the national currency.\u00a0\nThis attempt at digital cash is aimed only at protecting against a future de-dollarization of its economy, and realizing savings on the printing cost of paper money. It not only kills the monetary autonomy of the individual, it gives a government absolute power in matters of taxation, inflation and interest rates. Any other central bank that tries to repeat this experiment in a politically active and diverse country will have to take into account of all these factors in order to avoid any backlash.\u00a0\nWhat happens next is only guesswork, but the historical shift is knocking at the door. We have entered a world where both peer-to-peer communication as well as transfer of value would ensure a better distribution of human output. Whatever network achieves this will gain political acceptability. Who will do it \u2013 nations, global technology giants or some invisible agencies \u2013 is not yet clear, but something is going to happen.\n\u00a0\nPhoto\u00a0AgnosticPreachersKid\u00a0/ Wikimedia", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 25}

But it has now effectively been dragged into the current, and very public, privacy debate between Apple and the FBI.\nLast week, President Barack Obama said he believes a balance must be sought between privacy and security. As one example of the risks of strong encryption, and seemingly referring to cryptocurrencies, Obama pointed out that if government can't access phones, \u201ceverybody is walking around with a Swiss bank account in their pocket.\u201d\nTo find out where Bitcoin's industry representatives stand on this issue, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to\u00a0Bitcoin Foundation director Bruce Fenton\u00a0Coin Center director of research Peter Van Valkenburgh, and senior fellow at the libertarian think tank\u00a0Cato institute and former Bitcoin Foundation board member Jim Harper.\nEncryption and Law Enforcement\nThe current debate on encryption started when recent acts of terrorism in San Bernardino, California brought about a highly publicized showdown between Apple and the FBI.\nAfter a San Bernardino couple, Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people, the FBI found Farook\u2019s iPhone 5C was locked with a password and data encrypted. The action of the FBI to seek the decryption from the terrorist Farook\u2019s iPhone brought Apple into the California district court of Judge Sheri Pym, who ruled Apple should offer \u201creasonable technical assistance\u201d to law enforcement, and must provide a tool that would allow federal agents to beat a security feature that prevents the phone from erasing after some failed unlocking attempts.\nApple CEO Tim Cook, however, worries that creating a patch to enable entry through a back door threatens the ability to maintain privacy for its hundreds of millions of customers worldwide.\nThis sentiment was echoed by Bitcoin industry representatives.\nBitcoin Foundation director Bruce Fenton \u2013 who also organizes the industry's\u00a0Satoshi Roundtable \u2013 took over as director of the foundation last year.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, he stated:\n\n\u201cThere are those who believe privacy is a right and there are those who believe that it is not. I don't support efforts to erode privacy under claims of defense from imaginary threats.\u201d\n\nJim Harper, who at Cato works to adapt law and policy to the information age, wholeheartedly agreed.\n\u201cWeakening encryption for terrorism investigations, money laundering prevention and tax collection would cost more in lost security for everyone than it would benefit us through greater security, crime control and fattened government coffers,\u201d Harper said. \u201cI've personally been working for several years to strengthen Fourth Amendment doctrine in the Supreme Court. My work may help courts recognize that conscripting Apple into writing code that breaks its security is a Fourth Amendment seizure of Apple's resources, and an unreasonable one.\u201d\nImplications for Bitcoin\nSeveral Bitcoin wallet apps currently offer \u201czero knowledge security\u201d which ensures user data by generating private keys completely client side.\nBut what happens if Pandora\u2019s Box is opened? What if encryption is weakened or even broken by state agencies?\nZeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, sees trying to break the encryption protecting one phone as having \u201cextremely damaging implications\u201d for the rights of many millions of people worldwide, with possible effects on their physical and financial security.\nObama, meanwhile, seemed to suggest that this kind of financial security should in fact not be absolute. He believes a balance must be struck, suggesting encryption should be weakened to allow government agencies access to encrypted phones in certain cases.\nPeter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center, doubts any technical trade-offs are possible at all.\n\u201cYou can't weaken encryption,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou can only weaken the ability of American companies to compete in the development of secure technologies, and the ability of law-abiding American citizens to have secure tools. If Americans don't build and maintain these tools, then people in other countries or in the underground economy will. Outlawing the use or development of these tools will only hasten the demise of our legitimate institutions as they would continually fail to compete with international or extralegal institutions that are not hobbled by impractical restrictions.\u201d\nBut what if it is indeed technically possible to completely shut state agencies out of phones? Should that be considered a problem? Should we as a society be concerned about citizens walking around with Swiss bank accounts in their pockets, as Obama suggested?\nFenton doesn't believe so.\n\u201cMy first reaction to the president's statement was: 'So what?' Why should the federal government care if people have a bank account in their pocket? That is a technological achievement, and, in itself, is nothing close to a crime that government should be concerned with,\" Fenton said.\nHe added:\n\n\u201cIt is concerning when politicians reach far from concerns about crimes that have actual victims to areas which are more about restricting freedom than protecting citizens. I think we do need to worry about the trend of government officials who push the idea that citizens having privacy and control of their own money is somehow a bad thing. It's only in recent years, with the proliferation of credit cards and online banking, that government has become so presumptive about their rights to our privacy. I think this is much more dangerous than whatever drawbacks that privacy may have.\u201d\n\nTax Implications\nThe main reason Obama used the Swiss bank analogy is probably tax evasion. Using Bitcoin, it becomes increasingly easy for users to hide vast amounts of wealth, which enables citizens to avoid certain forms of tax evasion.\nIndustry representatives actually shared this concern \u2013 or at least believe the concern is valid.\nThough, according to Fenton:\n\n\u201cThe tail should not wag the dog regarding taxes and Bitcoin. Commerce, innovation and jobs come first. The IRS for decades had to deal with cash-based economies where it was very difficult to track real income and revenue. They should adjust and do whatever they need to do to adapt to new technology; we should not delay or impede innovation for concern that the IRS may have a harder job.\u201c\n\nHarper believes potential tax evasion issues will eventually call for alternative solutions.\n\n\u201cIn decades or perhaps even a century, Bitcoin or successor currencies and transaction mechanisms may narrow the field of taxable transactions,\u201d he said. \u201cFully digital transactions will be too fluid to catch or may lack a recognizable physical jurisdiction. This will push tax collection toward physical things like housing, durable goods, and disposable goods. It's all a long way off, though, I'll emphasize.\u201d\n\nMoney Laundering\nAnother problem often brought up regarding Bitcoin is money laundering. Increased anonymity and the inability of law enforcement to block or regulate the flow of funds enables criminals to use Bitcoin for nefarious purposes.\nFenton:\n\n\u201cPeople like New York State's former Superintendent of Financial Services Ben Lawsky, who's responsible for the\u00a0BitLicense, seem to take it as a given and indisputable fact that money laundering is a horrible crime. I challenge that notion. In most cases of money laundering there is no clear victim, no person or people who were actually harmed. Opportunists make the leap of saying that things like terrorism will be more prevalent because of money laundering, but this is hogwash. Terrorism is more of a risk because of things like bad foreign policy than money laundering. Could technologies like Bitcoin make life easier for criminals? Of course. Just as shoes, the Internet and mobile phones do. New technologies make things easier for everyone. Regulators and thief supporters would be better off spending time focusing on violators of the law than on technologies.\u201d\n\nHarper agreed:\n\n\u201cI don't worry about degrading governments' power to curtail money laundering because it is a regulatory crime, not a genuine wrong. Money laundering controls probably cost more in compliance expense and curtailed trade (especially internationally) than they provide in security, crime control and quality-of-life benefits. We're worse off as a society because of money laundering laws and the financial surveillance that supports them.\u201d\n\nAs such, the question is what the Bitcoin community can do to protect itself against potential weakening of encryption or breaches of security. Should Bitcoin companies and users accept certain trade-offs, or should they move to protect themselves?\nHarper prefers the latter.\n\u201cOur best defense is going to be shifting to open source, non-proprietary communications and transaction tools. Such tools don't have a head office that can be bought off, bullied, or required by law to render themselves insecure. It's going to be hard to make that shift, but there's no time like the present to get started,\u201d he said.\nThanks to Aaron van Wirdum for help with this article.", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 24}

The W3C drafts make only incidental mentions of Bitcoin and distributed ledger technologies. However, it\u2019s worth noting that digital currencies based on distributed ledgers are the only form of Internet-native payment system that exists, works and effectively implements one-click payments.\nThere are blockchain-based projects to add micropayment layers to the Web, including micropayments in the core Internet protocols, but adding payments to the underlying Web protocol itself would require years of standardization work by official bodies such as the W3C.\nAn interesting intermediate approach is integrating micropayments in the browser. A high-profile team headed by Brendan Eich, creator of the Javascript programming language and former CEO of Mozilla, recently launched a new browser dubbed Brave, which offers faster browsing by replacing ads with clean and light ads, with an option to switch ads off via Bitcoin micropayments. A forthcoming version of the Brave browser, planned for April, will include micropayments and a built-in Bitcoin wallet.\u00a0\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Eich to find out more about Brave\u2019s approach, strategy and roll-out schedule. Eich confirmed that the schedule for the built-in Bitcoin wallet is on track for April. The Brave micropayment economy will run on the Bitcoin blockchain.\u00a0\n\u201cWe don't need more risk multiplication via independent events' odds ratios,\u201d Eich said. \u201cIt may be that things change, but right now Bitcoin is the most mature permissionless option. We do not have time or funds to reinvent round-enough wheels.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Brave wallet will be implemented in partnership with Bitgo. \u201cWe put Bitcoin \u2018under the hood,\u2019 so [we] want a more enterprise-like partner,\u201d said Eich. \u201cWe're talking to Coinbase, Blockchain.info, and others, but for our built-in wallets, BitGo is the right partner.\u201d\nFull operations with ads and micropayments to publishers and users are scheduled for version 1.0. \u201cOur hope is to have trial ad campaigns flowing in the pre-1.0 timeframe, and we're working with a major agency toward this end,\u201d said Eich. \u201cOur developer timeline is here. Trials first, then revenue-bearing ad campaigns, which traditionally pay on a net-120 schedule, after anonymous confirmation of authentic impressions.\u201d\u00a0\nBrave is more than yet-another browser, and aims at deeply changing the Internet. \u201cBrave is a startup trying to grow a user base who loves our product for its speed and privacy of data handling, to help users build up their own data sets on their devices, never exfiltrated in the clear, not even to our servers,\u201d Eich told Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0\n\u201cThat's a more scalable model for the IoT/VR-multiverse future, again on general principles,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, much work lies ahead to standardize protocols for things like anonymous ads, pseudonymous high-integrity watermarks, micro-royalties, etc. We start with browsing, ad blocking and replacement and micropayments to our users and websites they browse.\u201d\nBrave\u2019s business model is centered on building its own ad network to replace the expensive, slow, resource-consuming and privacy-unfriendly ads of the main ad networks. \u201cWe could affect Doubleclick and other middle-players who take too much money out of the flow from advertisers to publishers, and who tax users by slowing down the web with trackers and ads that use up your mobile device's battery and which, too often, make your eyes bleed from badly targeted ads, if not from the occasional and rising threat of malvertisement,\u201d said Eich, and disclosed some aspects of the demographic data and analytics that Brave will offer to the advertisers in its network:\n\u201cWe're currently working on how to model our user base to give an idea of audience, and we are taking care to do this only via polling and other opt-in methods. As we bring up our NI-ZKIP (Non-Interative Zero Knowledge Proof) protocol for payments and ad confirmations, we will have better and deterministically anonymized data (not statistically or differentially private data).\u201d\n\u201cWe've studied all the cases where databases were supposedly anonymized and released, only to be studied later such that users were reidentified en masse. We're not giving away any such database, since we don't collect or keep one at all. All our users' data stays in the clear on their devices.\u201d\n\u201cOur cross-device sync, not yet implemented, will encrypt end to end using a client-private key. We plan to use a Key Recovery Service that's a separate business entity from us, with no way for us to get the user's key. A KRS is necessary for both cross-device encrypted data sync, and, of course, for BitGo's wallet, since users do sometimes lose keys. From past sync projects we've learned that users expect the encrypted data to be a usable backup, not just a mirror of device data that can't be used if all devices are lost.\u201d\nBrave users will be able to choose whether to block or replace the original ads with clean ads from the Brave network. The users who choose to replace ads will receive 15 percent of ad revenue in their wallets, which they will be able to use to buy ad-free access to their favorite sites. Publishers will receive at least 55 percent of ad revenue, which Brave hopes to increase to 70 percent.\nThe company is working on authentication specs for publishers, based on Let's Encrypt and other work to do Domain Verification right. \u201cAs the dismal history of PKI Certificate Authority mis-issuance of DV certs shows, one needs to be careful,\u201d said Eich. \u201cHere again, we think BitGo is a good partner. We'll cover costs of certification from a one-time fee against revenue share.\u201d\nEich is persuaded that the Brave solution could become a de-facto standard and be implemented in other browsers like Firefox and Safari, in piecewise standards. \u201cPrivate ad placement and anonymous ad confirmation are two possible pieces,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's fatal to standardize prematurely, but having worked successfully on [Javascript] and other standards for 20 years, I can see how to take our solution toward standardization in a modular way.\u201d\u00a0\nConcerning Web payment standards, Eich confirmed that the Brave team is following the Web Payment Request API as it moves toward First Published Working Draft status \u00a0\u201cLots of issues remain ahead,\u201d he said.\n\"The Web missed an opportunity back in the early days to define payments and all they entail as a standard,\" said Eich in his first Brave blog post on \u201cHow to Fix the Web.\u201d It\u2019s interesting to note that, much before Andreessen and Berners-Lee, Ted Nelson's Xanadu project \u2012 a conceptual precursor of today\u2019s Web, arguably more advanced \u2012 included payment standards. Xanadu\u2019s original concepts, proposed in the \u201870s, has been promoted by legendary cyber-culture icon Jaron Lanier in his book \"Who Owns the Future.\u201d\n\u201cI've been influenced in general by both Xanadu, and by Jaron's book,\u201d said Eich. \u201cWe do have a micro-royalty gleam in our eye with Brave. I'm an adviser to OTOY, and I've helped them pitch watermarking over DRM, since shared-3D-world artwork can't really be DRM'ed but is too easy to copy in full.\u201d\u00a0\nPayment standards are but one of the important features of Xanadu not included in today\u2019s Web. Another is two-way links, a feature which, according to Lanier, could be used together with micropayments to create a fair and sustainable Web economy. \u201cThe many-to-one nature of links creates a dual problem, the \u2018what pages link here\u2019 question that Google and other search engines can answer,\u201d commented Eich. \u201cWouldn't it be great if a decentralized system could answer this question, reliably and efficiently?\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 25}

For example, blockchain technology is out to eat the lunches of some professionals in the traditional financial system.\nThere\u2019s a Lot of Mistrust in the Banking System\nAt a recent blockchain-focused event in Toronto, Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd was asked to explain the reasoning behind Wall Street\u2019s increased interest in blockchain technology. During his initial response, Todd pointed out some of the mistrust that exists in the current financial system:\n\n\u201cThe dirty secret is [the banks] don\u2019t actually trust [their databases]. I mean, they don\u2019t trust their own employees. ... They don\u2019t trust each other. There\u2019s so many levels of mistrust here.\u201d\n\nTodd then discussed the massive industry built around financial audits. He noted:\n\n\u201cIf they did trust all this stuff, why are there so many auditors? Why is there this massive infrastructure of labor-intensive human beings sitting there poring over transactions and trying to figure out where the money got created out of thin air. Where did the money disappear? Who moved what where? Was it all legit?\u201d\n\nMany financial institutions are interested in the concept of creating new systems for record-keeping, which would replace the current closed-ledger system with a more open alternative, similar to Bitcoin. Many believe this open system would enable more efficient and transparent auditing of financial activity.\nThe Status Quo Is Doing All Right But It\u2019s Hard to Improve\nTodd also pointed out that financial institutions are already pretty good at what they do in terms of audits. He stated, \u201cFor the most part, bank fraud is at tolerable levels, it seems.\u201d\nTodd noted that maintaining a proper history of financial activity is one of the issues with increasing the speed of settlement. Because audits are labor intensive and require man hours to complete, it\u2019s difficult to essentially come to consensus on the correct version of events in a nearly instantaneous manner. He added, \u201cThe faster money can move around, the faster you could lose it all due to some hacker.\u201d\nHow Does the Blockchain Help?\nTodd spoke on the perceived advantages of blockchains over the current way things work, which relies on placing trust in database admins and the people with the keys to the system. From this perspective, a blockchain simply looks like a strong audit log. Todd gave a specific example of how this technology can help:\n\n\u201cIt could be something as simple as when I, as a bank employee, type something in, we really do want a cryptographic signature that\u2019s actually tied to my keycard or something. And that should go into a database. Well, what does that look like? It looks like a blockchain.\u201d\n\nThe longtime Bitcoin researcher also pointed out that this is sort of what banks were already looking at doing before blockchain technology started to receive a lot of attention. He explained:\n\n\u201cI think where they\u2019re thinking of going naturally looks like blockchains, so when they hear all this blockchain stuff it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh yeah. This is roughly what we were looking at doing anyway.\u2019\u201d\n\nReplacing Humans Is the Point\nAt one point during the recent event in Toronto, Todd was asked if the trend is that blockchains will eventually replace human auditors. Todd responded:\n\n\u201cAll this blockchain stuff is really about: How good can we make the security to get to the point where we can imagine getting rid of human beings?\u201d\n\nIndeed, Todd\u2019s comments appear to fit well with Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s original Bitcoin white paper. In the paper, Nakamoto stated:\n\u201cWhat is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust\u2026.\u201d\nGoing back further, cypherpunk Nick Szabo has written about the concept that third parties are security holes. In addition to improving security by cutting out trusted parties, financial institutions can cut costs by replacing human labor with computer code.\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nThere are few people as well-equipped to comment on the concept of blockchain-based crowd equity as Boost VC CEO Adam Draper. In addition to his involvement with the long list of blockchain-related investments made at Boost VC, Draper also launched BoostFunder, which he says was the first crowdfunding-for-equity platform.\nDraper recently shared some of his thoughts on blockchain-based crowd equity on an episode of the Bitcoin.com Podcast. Initially, the venture capitalist stated:\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re at this sort of crossroads with the crowdfunding of the coin-based system. It\u2019s going to work because it\u2019s efficient, you can keep track of it, and the ledger clears it automatically. There are a lot of things that are better about that system.\u201d\n\nDraper went on to discuss the need for regulatory approval of this type of system, the effects of the JOBS Act, and the need for this type of fundraising system to have time to develop and grow over time.\nRegulatory Approval Is Needed for Mass Adoption\nThe main issue Draper sees with blockchain-based crowd-equity platforms is the lack of regulatory approval. Draper explained, \u201cThe problem is right now that you need a regulatory body to adopt it. Otherwise, it\u2019s just not going to get mass approval.\u201d\nWhile many early Bitcoin and blockchain adopters do not like the idea of asking for regulatory approval, Draper said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be really, really important for the system to have that regulatory approval. You\u2019ll never go completely around the government.\u201d\nDraper then added that this need for regulatory clarity is not something he personally desires, but rather the simple reality of the situation. He noted:\n\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t love saying that \u2012 for the record. I also see the regulation as a barrier to entry. To get through that regulatory approval \u2012 that\u2019s something that a lot of startups can\u2019t get through. Really, regulation is an opportunity for a lot of people.\u201d\n\nAs Draper insinuated, the concept of regulatory capture is quite attractive to many businesses.\nEffects of the JOBS Act\nThe JOBS Act is expected to have a huge impact on the crowdfunded-equity industry. In fact, Draper described one aspect of the venture capitalist business that has already been altered by this legislation:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really interesting. We\u2019re actually seeing this in the last two or three weeks \u2012 this never happened before \u2012 but if you already filed with the SEC, other funds have actually already announced that they\u2019re fundraising. Not that they closed a fund, but that they\u2019re actually in the process of fundraising, which never happened before the JOBS Act.\u201d\n\nDraper also shared his own opinion on this new phenomenon:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an exciting thing. It allows more people to hear about it, it\u2019s less of a private thing, and it helps the fund. It\u2019s a lot of awareness. You drum up a lot of excitement for it. The solicitation thing is just such an obvious rule to make it a little better. It was so restrictive before.\u201d\n\nAlthough the JOBS Act has weakened restrictions on how people can raise funds over the Internet, exactly how this legislation will affect blockchain-based systems remains unclear. At the end of the day, the vision of allowing some kids in a garage to issue stock in their new startup as a colored coin is not quite here yet.\nCrowdfunded Equity Needs Time to Grow\nAs for the future of crowdfunded equity, Draper stated, \u201cI still think there\u2019s an evolution that\u2019s happening; it takes time.\u201d\nFor now, Draper claims the venture capitalist stills holds a lot of the power and value in the current fundraising system. Having said that, the Boost VC CEO also talked about how raising money on a crowdfunding platform, such as AngelList or Crowdfunder, could provide startups with a bit of extra reach. He added, \u201cBut it\u2019s really just add-on right now \u2012 just as far as the process that works to fundraise.\u201d\nIn his final thoughts on crowdfunded equity, Draper stated:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a really interesting experiment that probably happens in the next year that brings [crowdfunded equity] to life, so I think it\u2019s going to be awesome. I love disruption in every industry. If my own industry gets disrupted, I just hope I\u2019m on the side of it that\u2019s winning.\u201d\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

For that reason, some of the biggest names in banking, industry and technology have entered into the space to evaluate how this technology could change the financial world.\u00a0\nIBM and Linux, for instance, have brought together some of the brightest minds in the industry and technology to work on blockchain technology through the Hyperledger Project.\u00a0\nThe Hyperledger Project is under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation, and seeks to incorporate findings by blockchain projects such as Blockstream, Ripple, Digital Asset Holdings and others in order to make blockchain technology useful for the world\u2019s biggest corporations. IBM has also contributed its own code to the project.\u00a0\nAccording to John Wolpert, IBM\u2019s Global Blockchain Offering Director, when IBM and Linux began working together on the blockchain project, Linux made clear it wanted to \u201cdisrupt the disruption,\u201d in part with their findings, as well as the data gathered by projects such as Ripple, Ethereum and others exploring the blockchain. \u00a0\nThe Linux foundation announced its Hyperledger project on December 17, 2015. Just one day later, 2,300 companies had requested to join. The second-largest open source foundation in the history of open source had only 450 inquiries.\u00a0\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s either going to be a holy mess or it\u2019s going to change the world,\u201d Wolpert said at The Blockchain Conference in San Francisco presented by Lighthouse Partners. As Wolford puts it, a team of IBMers is \u201con a quest\u201d to understand and \u201cdo something important\u201d with blockchain technology.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why we got this rap in the \u201870s, way back, that we are not cool, that we\u2019re kind of stodgy, and that is not the IBM of my experience,\u201d Wolpert, who founded the taxi service Flywheel, explained. \u201cWe\u2019re the original crazy people. The craziest people are the guys at IBM in the \u201860s and \u201870s -- you can imagine what they were doing in the \u201860s -- they are wild-eyed revolutionaries.\u201d\u00a0\nAlthough this is not the image IBM markets, their work in quantum computing, quantum teleportation and neuro semantic chips count among some of the \u201ccool stuff\u201d IBM does, says Wolpert. IBM also approaches projects in the spirit of open innovation, and not proprietarily.\u00a0\n\u201cOur method of operations is open, and it\u2019s often our MO to back not-our-thing,\u201d he said of IBM since the 1990s.\u00a0\nWolpert cites Java as one such project: \u201cYou would not know about Java today if it weren\u2019t for IBM.\u201d\u00a0\nAs a \u201cpretty young dude,\u201d Wolpert was in the room when IBM made a billion-dollar decision to back Linux over its own technology. He also cites IBM\u2019s work on XML as an example of IBM\u2019s dedication to open innovation.\u00a0\nCurrently, IBM has employees working on crypto-security and distributed systems who have been working on consensus algorithms for their entire careers, some for more than 30 years.\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019re crazy smart, we\u2019re planetary, we\u2019ve gone from a couple of guys in a canoe, to a platoon and approaching an army of people working on blockchain,\u201d Wolpert said. \u201cSo it feels a lot like my first job at IBM which was making Java real for business.\u201d\u00a0\nThis has led old and new friends to contact the the multinational technology and consulting corporation.\n\u201cBanks who have been calling us constantly \u2026 saying \u2018What\u2019s your view on blockchain?\u2019 or \u2018Hey, let\u2019s do a project together on blockchain,\u2019\u201d Wolpert said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing all these crazy projects on blockchain, every kind of blockchain, and learning a lot, been doing that for a couple years and really started to accelerate last year.\u201d Today, there is a whole unit dedicated to blockchain technology at Linux Foundation.\u00a0\n\u201cWe went all-in on blockchain,\u201d he explained.\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s it all about for Wolpert? \u201cIt\u2019s about evolving the Internet.\u201d Bitcoin is important for moving money around without a single authority.\n\u201c[Bitcoin] is a solution to a problem, a specific problem, of people who need to move money around in environments where you don\u2019t trust the government,\u201d Wolpert said. \u201cI think we can all agree we are approaching the end of the era where a single authority manages trust and gets compensated for the risk in doing so.\u201d\u00a0\nIn Wolpert\u2019s view, finance does not need to go from today\u2019s system of trust -- where consumers trust institutions to handle their money -- to one of complete trustlessness, like the Bitcoin system in which a protocol, not a centralized authority, manages the movement of value.\u00a0\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t follow, having one single trust authority to trustlessness on everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a false dichotomy between the notion of trust and trustlessness, that you have to have a walled garden on one side and Bitcoin on the other.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t compare Bitcoin to the Internet, saying that\u2019s a wrong analogy.\u00a0\n\u201cIt is not apt to say the Internet is like Bitcoin; the Internet is, from the perspective of Bitcoin, a permissioned walled garden,\u201d he said. \u00a0\u201cEver heard of ICANN? It\u2019s permissive, but it\u2019s permissioned.\u201d\nBitcoin, Ripple and Ethereum are \u201cIteration 1\u201d of blockchain technology, the three time IBMer told his audience. Wolpert thinks blockchain technology will soon evolve to \u201cIteration 2.\u201d\u00a0\nThe problem with it?\u00a0\n\u201cThe Internet is constrained,\u201d Wolpert said. \u201cYou have a fabric that allows for lots of competition on platforms and huge amounts of competition on solutions and applications on top of it, so we need to evolve the Internet to become economically aware, and that Internet isn\u2019t going to be an application, it is going to be a fabric and then lots of applications on top of that.\u201d\nThis doesn\u2019t mean blockchain 2.0 technologies such as Blockstream, Ethereum and Ripple are lost causes that must now completely retool. The Linux Foundation, in fact, works with Ethereum and Ripple employees. With its blockchain projects, IBM is not focused on moving a cryptocurrency.\u00a0\n\u201cLots of banks pay us lots of money and we like that, and we want to radically improve them,\u201d Wolpert explained. \u201c[Bankers] are gonna try like heck to radically improve what is going on ahead of the disruption, disrupt themselves if you will. If you look at things like [Overstock\u2019s] t0, that\u2019s happening, might happen on Bitcoin protocol, but might not, and there\u2019s plenty of ways to solve it, when you commit to it. \u00a0And sure, Bitcoin has woken [banks] up to this, so it\u2019s doing its job, it\u2019s disrupting the thinking and maybe that is all that is necessary.\u201d\u00a0\nWolpert wonders aloud during his speech if the world would have iTunes were it not for Napster, or Netflix if it weren\u2019t for BitTorrent.\u00a0\nThe former head of products for IBM\u2019s Watson Ecosystem says IBM currently has a \u201cboomtown with giant numbers of people at IBM and everywhere else\u201d investigating the blockchain problem and how distributed technology can be made useful for industry.\u00a0\nHe details how oftentimes IBM tinkers with open innovations itself to make the technology ready for industry. That\u2019s not the route being taken with Bitcoin. That the Bitcoin network is on par with Ireland for energy consumption, and that mining consortiums could eventually dictate that market, scares the firm away from dealing directly with Bitcoin.\n\u201cWhat I want to see, what we want to see, is a world full of companies who I can know, who I can identify, who are so spread out, like the Internet,\u201d he said. Wolpert cites the Arab Spring, and the role the Internet played in that uprising, as how a permissioned, yet permissive, structure functions. Websites, albeit technology permissioned by ICANN, remained online during the protests and played a major role.\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s the risk in experimenting with blockchain?\u00a0\n\u201cThe risk is we go crazy, \u00a0we have an unruly mess,\u201d Wolpert warned. \u201c[But] it\u2019s the Linux Foundation, we\u2019ve been in this movie before. While there\u2019s a lot of really smart guys working on Bitcoin and startups, we\u2019ve got equally amount of people who also have 20 or 30 years of experience with open source and open innovation, and I think we have a good shot at maintaining \u00a0restraints, keeping it scoped down, keeping it simple, but getting it to something that is useful.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 28}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin was seemingly dragged into the very public debate on privacy and encryption recently. Specifically, President Barack Obama\u00a0 warned that if the government can't access phones, \u201c...everybody is walking around with a Swiss bank account in their pocket,\u201d which appeared to refer to cryptocurrency.\nLast week, Bitcoin Magazine\u00a0 reported on Bitcoin's industry representatives and their positions on encryption, privacy, Bitcoin's role in tax evasion and money laundering and more. In part two of our coverage: What do the actual builders of these pocket-sized \u201cSwiss bank accounts\u201d think?\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to\u00a0 Electrum developer Thomas Voegtlin,\u00a0 Breadwallet CEO Aaron Voisine,\u00a0 Mycelium developer Leo Wandersleb and\u00a0 Ledger CTO Nicolas Bacca to see where they stand.\nBroken\nThe debate on encryption and privacy caused by the ongoing dispute between Apple and the FBI took a sharp turn this week. The United States Department of Justice had long claimed it was unable to access encrypted iPhones without help from Apple, but this turned out not to be true.\nAlthough the Department of Justice did not explain how they got access to the phone, the Bitcoin wallet developers Bitcoin Magazine spoke to were not surprised that they could.\nLedger CTO Nicolas Bacca speculated:\n\u201cTo get access to the data, the FBI probably relied on some kind of physical attack involving the flash memory. Swapping the flash memory or disabling writes could get you infinite retries, so you can brute force the access code. The operating system doesn't handle that securely.\u201d\nBacca also pointed out that Bitcoin itself is much more secure than a typical iPhone.\n\u201cI believe Bitcoin is less at risk against physical attacks compared to other cryptosystems, because you always get a way to invalidate a possibly compromised key - just send the coins to a different address if you notice quickly enough. The issue is properly qualifying how long is that.\u201d\nBalance\nWhile the FBI demands Apple help\u00a0the government agency access encrypted iPhones, the tech company maintains that weakening encryption could result in a privacy disaster. Obama, explaining his position last week, argued it's important to find the right balance between privacy and security, suggesting weakened encryption should be an option.\nBut this option was firmly rejected by all wallet developers Bitcoin Magazine spoke to.\nElectrum developer Thomas Voegtlin explained:\n\u201cIn the physical world, you can design a door that is difficult to break. This means that someone may be able to force that door, but not covertly, and that is why we have a balance between privacy and security. But computers are devices that tend to make things binary. In the world of computing, you either do have the key, and opening the door is very easy, or you don't, and it is impossible. If we give a special key to the government, they will be able to open millions of doors with that key, with no effort, and without attracting attention. Nothing will prevent someone from misusing that key, and eventually the key will be leaked and fall into the wrong hands. A technological backdoor is the modern equivalent of the\u00a0 Ring of Gyges.\u201d\nLedger's Nicolas Bacca agreed.\n\u201cAs a society I believe we should be extremely worried about calls to weaken encryption,\u201d Bacca said. \u201cPractically, it cannot be done for a single target, as any 'NOBUS' backdoor turns into a global risk when it's discovered. Ideologically, we already had a clear demonstration that letting agencies run loose with that kind of absolute power was a pretty bad idea. Politically, I believe it can lead to important economic\u00a0collateral damages, which is another good reason to avoid doing it.\u201d\nVoisine agreed with this assesment as well. Moreover, the Breadwallet developer argued that strong encryption is itself a balancing factor against the widespread data monitoring,\u00a0not a factor that itself requires balance.\n\u201cPrivacy is core to the human experience. Imagine if your landlord or your extended family knew exactly how much money you had at any given time, and how much you spent and when. It would be a disaster. Privacy is a leveler that allows parties with otherwise unequal bargaining power to negotiate on equal footing. It\u2019s even required by law in many situations, such as with the finances of publicly traded firms. Intentionally weakened encryption is absolutely something that we should all be worrying about. In a future world with the potential for ubiquitous surveillance, strong encryption available to individuals will be the counterbalancing force,\u201d Voisine said.\nTaxation\nPerhaps the main reason Obama cited the Swiss bank account example was to point out that strong encryption could allow citizens an easy escape from certain types of taxation. More specifically, Bitcoin users can potentially store significant amounts of wealth on their phones without government agencies knowing about it, or even being able to touch it.\nMycelium developer Leo Wandersleb, however, questioned whether that should be considered a problem at all.\nWandersleb:\n\u201cSo Obama is worried that government might not have ultimate power over its citizens' assets? Help me, why again does he assume the right to have that power? I'm not a U.S. citizen, so excuse me if I'm not too firm with regard\u00a0to the Constitution and its amendments ... but I know of nothing that would say 'all property is yours unless the government doesn't agree.'\u201d\nElectrum's Voegtlin took a slightly more moderate position.\n\u201cI am not an anarchist, and my involvement with Bitcoin is not motivated by anti-government ideology. I believe in a society with government, with taxes and law enforcement. I write Bitcoin software because I believe that the benefits of cryptocurrency, for society and for our economies, far outweigh the risks. However, we should not be denying there are risks. New technologies always carry new risks.\u201d\nBut the answer to combating these risks is not to encroach on encryption, Voegtlin pointed out. Rather, he believes the risks should be mitigated through alternative means.\nVoegtlin:\n\u201cI think that law enforcement and taxation will need to adapt to cryptocurrency. In 2011, Pirate Party founder Rick Falkvinge\u00a0 proposed that, in a world with Bitcoin, governments should tax consumption, rather than wealth or income. I believe that level of thinking is appropriate.\u201d\nVoisine, too, believes the answer will eventually be looked for in alternative methods of taxation.\n\u201cThere are many tax revenue streams that are difficult to avoid even with the leveling power of privacy putting the individual on a more equal footing with the state. Two examples are use taxes and property taxes. As the industry grows and the world moves their wealth into Bitcoin, I think we will see a gradual shift toward more heavy reliance on these types of income streams by the state. This has the added benefit of making the true cost of state services and programs more transparent. Privacy for individuals and transparency for the state is a wonderful thing.\u201d\nSecurity\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Bitcoin wallet developers have no intention of weakening the security or decreasing the privacy they offer. Rather, most intend to increase both the security and privacy of their products where possible.\nMycelium currently uses a server-based model, which means governments could potentially pressure the wallet provider to give up certain privacy sensitive information or provide false transaction data to users.\nBut Wandersleb explained the wallet intends to improve this:\n\u201cWe are working on removing ourselves from the equation. Our new wallet will not depend on our servers, so there will be no single point of failure. It will also be open source, so even if we were forced to weaken our product, others could choose to distribute reliable versions. Lastly, Mycelium works with hardware wallets that provide a very good protection against broken operating systems.\u201d\nBacca's Ledger is one of the companies working with Mycelium to realize this solution. Bacca explained:\n\u201cWe are building additional security layers directly on the phones when we can, and we're also building a new hardware wallet device, Ledger Blue. This provides open applications development on a Secure Element, which a phone can use over Bluetooth low-energy. That would be close to the hypothetical doomsday device referred to by Obama.\u201d\nAnd Voisine, too, emphasized that privacy and security remain top priorities for Breadwallet.\nVoisine:\n\u201cA Swiss bank in every pocket empowers the individual in incredible ways we've never seen before. It's time that this option becomes available to the whole world, not just the wealthy and politically connected, and we are going to give it to them.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 29}

The funds raised would be used to support Bitcoin Core development efforts.\u00a0\nCore developers Gavin Andresen, Cory Fields and Wladimir van der Laan currently work as a team for the MIT\u2019s Digital Currency Initiative and, according to DCI director Brian Forde, the Bitcoin Developer Fund is intended to give the three Bitcoin coders an academic platform to work on resolving the block-size debate and other similar technical challenges.\n\"We built out the fund to be able to support people like Wlad [van der Laan], Cory [Fields] and Gavin [Andresen] who have supported bitcoin to continue their work in an academic way,\"\u00a0Forde told CoinDesk.\nThe donors to the fund include companies including BitFury, Bitmain, Chain, Circle and Nasdaq\u00a0and individuals such asJim Breyer, Jim Pallotta, Jeff Tarrant, Reid Hoffman and Fred Wilson.\nMIT\u2019s Media Lab created the Digital Currency Initiative in April 2015 after the Bitcoin Foundation reported bankruptcy and\u00a0announced plans to split up into a promotional body, a development body and an additional standards body specifically geared toward the standardization of the Bitcoin protocol.\nMIT\u2019s Media Lab was initially supposed to host a Bitcoin standards body as a part of the Digital Currency initiative, but Forde later announced that MIT\u2019s Media Lab would host neither a development nor a standards body. Instead, it would allow the developers to focus on improving Bitcoin Core.\n\u201cThe Digital Currency Initiative is not hosting a development NOR a standards body. [Andresen, Van der Laan and Fields] have accepted positions at the Media Lab to continue developing [Bitcoin core] \u2014 a community-driven free software project.\u201d \u00a0Forde told Cointelegraph last year.\n\n\u201cAs I mentioned in my post, we want them to do exactly what they were doing before \u2014 write the code that maintains and improves Bitcoin core. We look forward to providing them with a stable platform and the resources needed to allow them to best support the community.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Forde reiterated the same stance on a\u00a0post on Medium and said that they started the Digital Currency Initiative (DCI) at MIT, with the goal to create an environment that enabled diversity of work and thought on cryptocurrencies among students, researchers and open-source developers.\nAs for the funds, Forde said in the\u00a0Medium post that the money will be used to cover salaries, travel and overall support of Bitcoin protocol development efforts, including events such as the Scaling Bitcoin workshop series.\nHe further clarified that the donors would have no influence over the developers since the donations were made in what he calls \"unrestricted gifts.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that these donations are made as unrestricted gifts,\u201d Forde said. \u00a0\n\n\u201cThis means that, while the funds will be limited to support Bitcoin protocol development, the donors do not have any influence over the developers. Lastly, nothing has changed for Cory, Gavin and Wlad\u200a \u2014\u200a the goal of this announcement is to publicly recognize the sponsors and address questions people might have about the fund.\u201d\n\nThe DCI itself is funded by sponsors of MIT\u2019s Media Lab and not the fund announced today. All the funds will be disbursed in U.S. dollars, even those received in Bitcoin.\nPhoto\u00a0Knight Foundation\u00a0/ Wikimedia Commons", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 29}

(DTCC), a firm at the center of Wall Street\u2019s trading infrastructure, is about to launch an important test of distributed ledger technology: seeing whether it can provide workable solutions for the $2.6 trillion repo market, The Wall Street Journal reports.\nDTCC will collaborate with Digital Asset Holdings for planning and running the test. \u00a0Earlier this year, DTCC participated in a $52 million funding round for Digital Asset Holdings, with other investors including JP Morgan, Citi, Accenture, CME Group and ASX, the company behind Australia\u2019s stock market.\nA repurchase agreement (repo) is a form of short-term borrowing for dealers in securities. The dealer sells the government securities to investors, usually on an overnight basis, and buys them back the following day. Repos play a critical role in the financial system by keeping cash and securities circulating among hedge funds, investment banks and other financial firms.\nDTCC, established in 1999, focuses on post-trade financial services, providing clearing and settlement services to the financial markets. It provides central custody of securities and ways for buyers and sellers to make their exchanges in a safe and efficient way. In 2011, DTCC settled the vast majority of securities transactions in the United States and close to $1.7 quadrillion in value worldwide, making it by far the highest financial value processor in the world.\nIn a joint press release, DTCC and Digital Asset Holdings announced plans to develop and test a distributed ledger-based solution to manage the clearing and settlement of U.S. Treasury, agency, and agency mortgage-backed repo transactions. Repo agreements were selected for this proof-of-concept because there is an opportunity to streamline how these products are cleared as repo transaction volumes continue to grow.\n\u201cDistributed ledger technology has the potential to revolutionize certain post-trade processes that are inefficient and complex, and repos are a great place to start,\u201d said Mike Bodson, President & CEO of DTCC. \u201cThere are absolute opportunities to make clearing in this area much more efficient, and we look forward to working with Digital Asset on this exciting project. This initiative reflects our strong commitment to leverage this technology and help lead the industry to further lower risk and increase efficiency across financial markets.\u201d\nDTCC and Digital Asset will add cryptographic ledgers to existing securities trade and settlement flows. According to the companies, the project will demonstrate how market participants will be able to create and interact with a ledger of obligations and positions which evidence matched securities transactions, including normal trading activity and repo agreements. Distributed ledger technology was chosen for its real-time information sharing capabilities, which will enable buy- and sell-side firms to agree to repo trade details much more quickly, lowering risks and costs.\u00a0\n\u201cThis collaboration further demonstrates Digital Asset\u2019s commitment to enhancing post-trade processes for financial market infrastructure providers and market participants,\u201d said Blythe Masters, CEO of Digital Asset. \u201cDTCC has an important role to play in the integration of a distributed ledger ecosystem with the existing financial landscape, and this joint effort will accelerate innovation while decreasing cost and risk for our clients.\u201d\nMasters, a financial superstar, was appointed CEO of Digital Asset Holdings last year after a long career at JPMorgan. In 2015, Digital Asset Holdings acquired blockchain companies with innovative technologies and became a founding premier member of the Linux Foundation\u2019s open source Hyperledger Project, to drive the adoption and standardization of distributed ledger technology.\nDTCC is also a member of the Hyperledger project.\u00a0\n\u201cAs a member of Hyperledger, DTCC is helping to play a leading role in creating the governance and standards for distributed ledger technology,\u201d said DTCC Managing Director and Chief Technology Architect Robert Palatnick in a recent Hyperledger Project update issued by the Linux Foundation. \u201cOur goal is to ensure that new opportunities are in the best interests of the post-trade process and consistent with our long-term goals of mitigating risk, enhancing efficiencies and driving cost reductions for financial market participants. Open source and industry-wide collaboration are essential to realizing the full potential of distributed ledger technology and to avoid creating a disconnected maze of siloed solutions.\u201d\n\u201cWorking with DTCC is much easier than going to talk to all the participants in the repo market separately and persuading them to adopt a new technology,\u201d added Masters in an interview quoted by The Wall Street Journal.\nThe move indicates that distributed ledger technology is on its way to becoming an important part of tomorrow\u2019s fintech, and there\u2019s no turning back. The first phase of the DTCC and Digital Asset repo project will start immediately, developing a proof-of-concept and integrating it into the DTCC environment. Future phases will include collaboration and testing with market participants to ensure the solution meets industry needs. Then, as reported by The Wall Street Journal, DTCC plans to deploy blockchain technology to other markets outside of repos.\nThe detailed development and implementation plan hasn\u2019t been disclosed, but it\u2019s worth noting that Digital Asset Holdings and the Linux Foundation seem to support closed, \u201cpermissioned\u201d blockchains that don\u2019t carry Bitcoin as a currency.", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 30}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin Core developers Dr. Pieter Wuille, Eric Lombrozo and Johnson Lau launched a fourth \u2013 and probably final \u2013 iteration of the Segregated Witness testnet today. Perhaps most importantly compared to\u00a0previous\u00a0versions, \u201cSegNet 4\u201d includes support for another upcoming Bitcoin protocol improvement,\u00a0CheckSequenceVerify (CSV). This allows for experimentation with routable bidirectional payment channels, better known as lightning networks.\nSegregated Witness is the nifty technical innovation that allows senders of Bitcoin transactions to move cryptographic signatures from typical blocks to separate structures. This is set to improve the Bitcoin protocol in several ways, including a long-awaited fix of\u00a0transaction malleability. And, very relevant in light of the ongoing scaling debate, Segregated Witness will offer up to 1 megabyte of additional block space, depending on the types of transactions.\nCompared to earlier SegNets, SegNet 4 includes CSV support. CSV allows users to make bitcoins unspendable for a period of time, much like\u00a0CheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV), but with a relative timelock. Whereas CLTV locks bitcoins up until a specific time in the future, CSV locks bitcoins up for a specific amount of time after a CSV transaction is included in a block. This enables more sophisticated smart contracts, as it allows for greater flexibility.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Bitcoin Core developer and\u00a0Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo explained that the combination of Segregated Witness and CSV particularly benefits added scaling layers on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\u201cSegNet 4 offers a testing environment for routable bidirectional payment channels such as the\u00a0Lightning Network or\u00a0Amikopay,\u201d Lombrozo said. \u201cThese projects could drastically increase Bitcoin's scalability, and allow for instant secure and cheap payments. With SegNet 4, we're providing a common network on which different projects can collaborate and test their ideas. It is open for anyone, and we're encouraging wallet developers to play around with it.\u201d\nSince Segregated Witness offers both effective added block space, and enables improved added layers like the Lightning Network, the innovation represents an important early step in Bitcoin Core's scalability road map. But while the innovation is typically expected to be rolled out within the next month, Lombrozo did temper expectations a bit.\n\u201cThe original roadmap doesn't include specific dates, but the FAQ page on the Bitcoin Core website notes an April deployment of Segregated Witness,\u201d Lombrozo explained. \u201cWe're making a lot of progress, but we have a very rigorous testing and code review process which is necessary to ensure the Bitcoin network continues to operate safely and reliably. We plan to propose a feature-complete pull request in the coming month, but it might take a little longer before Segregated Witness is actually accepted and merged into Bitcoin Core. It\u2019s a top priority, however, and we hope to be able to safely deploy Segregated Witness very soon.\u201d\nA main benefit of the current Segregated Witness design is that it can be deployed as a soft fork. Once the code is accepted and merged, only miners will need to upgrade; all other users can change their software if and whenever they want to, with no risk of being thrown off the network. Moreover, a recent improvement to the Bitcoin protocol allows soft forks to be rolled out more easily and faster than before, which should benefit Segregated Witness activation as well.\nLombrozo said:\n\n\u201cWe're using BIP9 for activation, which means we can deploy CSV and Segregated Witness in parallel; Segregated Witness won\u2019t have to wait for CSV activation nor vice versa. We will most likely merge CSV into Bitcoin Core in the next couple weeks, as it's been more thoroughly tested and is in the final stages of review. A Segregated Witness pull request will hopefully follow shortly after.\u201d\n\nThe proposed Segregated Witness concept for Bitcoin was first introduced by Bitcoin Core developer and Blockstream co-founder Dr. Pieter Wuille at the second\u00a0Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Hong Kong last December. The idea is widely embraced by Bitcoin's development community \u2013 though it has also received some\u00a0critique since. If a problem is found in SegNet 4, there might be a fifth iteration of the testnet, but the design is not expected to undergo further changes.\nFor more information on Segregated Witness, see Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s\u00a0three-part\u00a0series\u00a0on the proposal.", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 30}

Liabilities on the central bank\u2019s balance sheet include banknotes and commercial bank reserves, and are the means of settlement for all of the economy\u2019s transactions. Currently, only banks can hold deposits at the Bank of England. A CBDC could open up access to these liabilities to specific groups of financial services firms, or even to individuals.\nA CBDC could also allow a central bank to set a negative interest rate on cash, rather than only deposits. The Bank of England\u2019s Chief Economist signalled in 2015 that the U.K. government was considering this possibility.\nBroadbent recognizes that there could be significant economic implications if a CBDC competed with commercial banks by permitting individuals to make deposits. In a fractional-reserve banking system, commercial banks accept deposits and loan money using these deposits as collateral. This can be to other banks, businesses, individuals and organizations. This leads to a cycle of lending and increases the money supply in the entire economy.\nWhile the central bank\u2019s balance sheet consists of liquid assets, commercial banks\u2019 balance sheets are mostly illiquid assets in the form of loans. Broadbent described commercial bank balance sheets as \u201cinherently fragile\u201d due to their being backed by very different assets of mostly illiquid loans. As the government guarantees deposits at the Bank of England, a flight to safety may take place and drain commercial banks of resources.\nGiven the Bank of England\u2019s responsibility to promote financial stability, opening up access to central bank deposits may seem counterintuitive. However, Broadbent says this could encourage commercial banks to \u201cnarrow\u201d and shift to structures with assets as liquid as their liabilities. In this scenario, \u201cdeposits would become inherently more secure.\u201d\nHowever, a shift to this structure could reduce lending by banks to the real economy. Many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are unable to issue their own securities, so lines of credit from banks are vital support. In the U.K., the British Bankers\u2019 Association recorded \u00a3107.5 billion ($152 billion) in SME borrowing facilities at the end of 2015, including \u00a326.6 billion ($37.7 billion) in new loans provided by banks to SMEs in 2015.\nBlockchain as a Clearinghouse\n\u201cThe main point here is that the important innovation in Bitcoin isn\u2019t the alternative unit of account \u2026 but its settlement technology, the so-called \u201cdistributed ledger.\u201d\u00a0 This allows transfers to be verifiably recorded without the need for a trusted third party.\u00a0 It is potentially valuable when there is no such institution and when verifying such information on a multilateral basis is costly,\u201d said Ben Broadbent, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England\nBroadbent identified the distributed ledger as the most important innovation in digital currencies, describing it as a \u201cdecentralized virtual clearinghouse and asset register\u201d that \u201coffers an entirely new way of exchanging and holding assets, including money.\u201d\nHe recognises the potential for distributed ledgers to replace the existing complex system of custodians of securities, brokers, exchanges and clearinghouses, each of which is obliged to keep its own records. There is much potential for systemic efficiency savings; clearance and settlement of securities has been estimated by Autonomous Research to cost G7 economies $54 billion annually.\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nThe Bank will continue examining potential use of digital currencies as a part of its \u201cOne Bank Research Agenda.\u201d This also encourages the wider community to consider policy questions, monetary and financial stability perspectives on CBDCs, implications for government-backed deposit insurance and regulation of institutions offering access to CBDCs.\nPotential use of blockchain technology will also be investigated in the Bank\u2019s review of its Real Time Gross Settlement system, which transfers balances between participants\u2019 accounts at the Bank.\nAt this stage, the Bank is raising more questions than it answers. It is not the only one carrying out such research; the People\u2019s Bank of China has announced that it is also discussing the possibility. There is clearly significant potential for CBDCs from a policy perspective, but structural implications must be considered.", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 31}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nFor the past few years, many of the biggest players in the Bitcoin industry have talked about the need to build bridges to the traditional financial system. This sort of basic infrastructure has been in development by Coinbase, the Winklevoss twins and others, and it\u2019s now getting to the point where user-friendly wallets and regulated exchanges are finally available to the masses.\nNow that the base layer of services has been built, Coinbase plans to promote greater adoption of Bitcoin through the development and acquisition of new applications for the digital currency.\nActual Products for Users\nIn a recent Medium post, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong discussed the company\u2019s overall vision for the future of Bitcoin and its product. While Armstrong would still like to see the company focus on making it easy for anyone to buy or sell bitcoins at the tap of a button, the Coinbase CEO also sees an opportunity for his company to help the industry grow through the development of killer apps.\nIn his recent post, Armstrong wrote:\n\u201cIn the future, you\u2019ll see Coinbase build or buy other apps in the space to help drive consumer adoption.\u201d\nArmstrong then used an analogy to the early days of the Web browser to bring home his point:\n\n\u201cWhen Netscape came out with their web browser, there weren\u2019t very many people building websites. It wasn\u2019t until they tried building one of the first web apps themselves (a shopping mall) that they realized there were a few missing pieces. This led to them inventing cookies, SSL, and javascript. Trying to build on top of your own infrastructure is a good way to improve it.\u201d\n\nNow that Coinbase has made it relatively easy for much of the world to purchase bitcoins online, the company wants to provide its users with various products and services that take advantage of the digital currency\u2019s unique efficiency offerings.\nFinancial Services and Internet Applications\nAlthough Armstrong did not point out specific applications Coinbase may build or acquire, he has discussed some of the main use cases of Bitcoin in the past. In an interview from last summer, Armstrong pointed to the disruption of traditional financial services, the development of financial services in the developing world, and entirely new Internet applications as three key areas for Bitcoin.\nIn the case of the disruption of financial services, Armstrong views international remittances and peer-to-peer lending as two areas of interest. Armstrong\u2019s point on the developing world mainly had to do with populations that have a large number of cellphones but no access to banking.\nLighthouse and decentralized prediction markets were mentioned as two possibilities for entirely new Internet applications made possible by Bitcoin. Armstrong added, \u201cThese are very small today, but I think in the future, some of these will end up being multi-billion dollar companies and systems.\u201d\nArmstrong has also discussed the value of using Bitcoin for microtransactions.\nMore Futuristic Use Cases\nMore recently, Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam discussed Bitcoin\u2019s ability to remove banner ads and spam from the Internet. Ehrsam sees a future where the action of making a payment is no longer necessary and transactions can take place seamlessly in the background of various devices.\nThe concepts of paying for online content via microtransactions and automatically purchasing system resources are ideas currently being worked on by multiple companies such as 21 and Brave.\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

In fact, in an\u00a0Emerging Theme Radar note sent to its clients, Goldman Sachs has declared that the technology has the capability of drastic change.\n\u201cWhile the Bitcoin hype cycle has gone quiet, Silicon Valley and Wall Street are betting that the underlying technology behind it, the Blockchain, can change\u2026 well everything.\u201d\u00a0the note reads.\nBut, amid all the hype and excitement lie several legal and compliance issues that mainstream financial institutions will have to address if they choose to adapt the bitcoin blockchain technology as a replacement for the current financial infrastructure.\nIn a recent\u00a0research paper exploring the complications that banks and other financial institutions \u00a0could face switching to a virtual ledger based on the bitcoin blockchain, Angela Walch, an attorney and assistant professor at St. Mary's University School of Law, said that while the existing financial system infrastructure is obsolete and needs to be upgraded, any replacements to the existing financial system should be reliable.\n\u201cBut in all the excitement over this technological boon, we must keep in mind the enormous importance of reliable financial market infrastructure, and ensure that replacements to existing financial market infrastructures can be counted on,\u201d\u00a0Walch said.\nWalch said that since using a single ledger, or blockchain, is not akin to signing a contract with a third party for a service, financial institutions might face complex legal and compliance snags while switching to a virtual ledger like the bitcoin blockchain.\nAccording to Walch, some of the bitcoin blockchain\u2019s basic features, including its status as software, its decentralized structure and its open-source software development process, creates various technology and governance risks against its potential as a financial infrastructure.\nBitcoin Blockchain\u2019s Upgrade Process\nWalch said that like any other software, the bitcoin blockchain, too, is vulnerable to bugs and attacks. Besides that, blockchain software is ever changing through new releases, and this may create a dispute and cause a split or fork\u00a0in the network.\n\u201cThe evolving nature of software through new releases may be a bigger problem for decentralized Bitcoin than it is for more centralized financial market infrastructures,\u201d\u00a0Walch said.\n\n\u201cSince controversial new releases of Bitcoin software may be unevenly adopted, there would seem to be potential for periodic forks in the network when consensus cannot be found amidst the parties in the network. This undermines the reliability of the Bitcoin blockchain, as has already been demonstrated in the March 2013 fork.\"\n\nThe Bitcoin Blockchain\u2019s Decentralized Structure\nAccording to Walch, bitcoin blockchain\u2019s decentralized structure means it does not have an official organization or party that operates it, and the lack of any entity or organization bound by legal obligations to keep the blockchain software operational can become a major risk for financial institutions looking to adopt the bitcoin blockchain technology.\n\u201cWith existing centralized financial market infrastructure, it is at least clear who has the responsibility to manage and repair it, and it is possible to impose risk-management obligations on someone,\u201d\u00a0Walch said. \u201cMaintaining the functionality of financial market infrastructure is hugely important, and having no one specifically tasked with the responsibility for achieving this for blockchain is a significant risk.\u201d\nBitcoin\u2019s Open-Source Software Development Process\nWalch says that similar to the bitcoin blockchain\u2019s decentralized structure, its open source software development process creates a situation where everyone interested may participate in the development and maintenance of the software, but no one is legally obligated to do so.\u00a0\n\u201cIf a crisis related to Bitcoin\u2019s operation or value should arise, there are no financial systems or payments experts who would necessarily be involved in reacting to the crisis.\u201d\u00a0Walch said.\n\n\u201cIt seems to make sense to have people with an in-depth understanding of the world financial and monetary systems as a whole, involved in making decisions about how it operates. Functioning financial market infrastructure benefits everyone who uses it, and users of a particular payment system or central clearinghouse are crippled if it stops working.\u201d\n\n\u00a0Even though banks or other financial institutions can address some of the operational issues above by creating private blockchains and hiring software coders to create the ledger and keep up with maintenance, Walch says that questions about fiduciary responsibilities will always come into play with such a highly regulated industry working with a decentralized process.\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 29}

The Linux Foundation and its members are collaborating on an open source infrastructure that will increase privacy and scalability, among many other benefits.\u201d\nThe project\u2019s governing board, which manages business direction, including governance, marketing and operational decisions, has been expanded with new elected members from SWIFT and itBit.\n\u201cSWIFT is delighted to support this industry wide effort to advance distributed ledger technology,\u201d said new governing board member Craig Young, SWIFT\u2019s chief technology officer, in December. \u201cCooperation and collaboration \u2012 hallmarks of the SWIFT cooperative \u2012 will be key to ensuring the scalability and adoption of this technology.\u201d\n\u201cAs a financial services company that provides blockchain-based solutions, we understand the technology gaps that need to be filled to ensure enterprise demands are met,\u201d added new governing board member Charles Cascarilla, itBit's co-founder and CEO. \u201cOpen source projects like the Hyperledger Project unite the world\u2019s leading companies to address critical needs and advance a technology for greater adoption.\u201d\u00a0\nChris Ferris, distinguished engineer and CTO of open technology at IBM, has been appointed chair of the technical steering committee, which drives technical direction of the Hyperledger Project and includes recognized experts from Digital Asset Holdings, Intel, R3 and Accenture.\n\u201cThese member investments demonstrate that blockchain technology continues to grow in importance as the alternative approach to multinational business transactions,\u201d said Ferris. \u201cBy providing a community for members to collaborate and contribute to an open source blockchain solution, we\u2019re able to advance the technology collectively and ultimately drive quicker adoption and higher value across industries.\u201d\nThe Linux Foundation\u2019s announcement notes that Hyperledger wants to be a cross-industry open standard for distributed ledgers, able to securely and cost-effectively trade and track any digital exchange with value, such as real estate contracts and energy trades. Besides finance, The Linux Foundation envisages applications to manufacturing, banking, insurance and the Internet of Things (IoT).\u00a0\n\u201cThere is no other effort advancing an open blockchain with this level of broad industry representation and level of leadership,\u201d said Jim Zemlin, executive director at The Linux Foundation. \u201cThe Hyperledger Project is among our fastest growing projects at The Linux Foundation. The opportunity is great. This leadership team and the community investments among members across industries put the project in the best position possible to accomplish its mission.\u201d\nThe growth of the Hyperledger project seems unstoppable and prompts speculation on the future of the distributed ledger ecosystem. In particular, and apparently in contrast with the project\u2019s open-source nature and oversight by The Linux Foundation, Hyperledger seems a radical alternative to the Bitcoin blockchain built by the banks, for the banks, which wants to retain the practical advantages of distributed ledger technology \u2012 fast and cheap transactions permanently recorded in a tamper-proof ledger \u2012 without the troublesome P2P openness and grassroots, anarchic nature of the the open, public Bitcoin blockchain.\nMasters, among others, expressed support for private, \u201cpermissioned\u201d non-Bitcoin blockchains.\u00a0\n\u201cTo be used by financial institutions, including capital markets firms and insurers, blockchains must supplant the costly methods introduced by Bitcoin with a mechanism that guarantees security, privacy and speed without paying for anonymous consensus,\u201d said two Accenture executives in July.\u00a0\nIn Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s interview with Zemlin published in February, he was asked, \u201cIs the Hyperledger Project a replacement for Bitcoin and/or other existing cryptocurrencies?\u201d Zemlin gave a diplomatic answer and emphasized that \u201cthere is ample room in the market for cryptocurrencies and even multiple implementations of the blockchain, but everyone stands to lose if these don\u2019t interoperate and work together.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 31}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nRussian software architects and entrepreneurs Alex Paperno, Eugene Porubaev and Vlad Kravchuk plan to take the insurance company out of insurance. Their\u00a0Teambrella, a Bitcoin-based peer-to-peer insurance platform, allows users to provide each other coverage for whatever they want, however they want, and without requiring any trusted intermediaries.\nPaperno:\n\n\u201cAnyone who ever needed a reimbursement knows that insurance companies are actually not interested in paying out at all; it\u2019s not in their benefit to help their customers. We intend to remove that conflict of interest, and make insurance fair and transparent.\u201d\n\n\u201cTeam Coverage\u201d\nSo, what is Teambrella?\nIn essence, Teambrella is a platform that allows people to form teams that offer each other coverage. If one person within that team requires reimbursement, the rest of the team chips in to provide it.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Paperno explained:\n\n\u201cAs opposed to a typical insurance, Teambrella team members don't pay a set periodical fee, but instead deposit funds into a special Bitcoin wallet. As long as there are sufficient funds in this wallet, that team member is insured. Or, if there's \u2018insufficient\u2019 funds in the wallet for full coverage, the team member is simply partly insured.\u201d\n\nEach Teambrella Bitcoin wallet is linked to a specific team member, but locked using multi-signature. The funds on that wallet can be spent only if both the insured team member, and three out of eight semi-randomly selected teammates, sign for it. As such, neither the insured person nor his team can withdraw bitcoins from the wallet without help from the other. (But typically, a team member should be able to exit a team whenever he wants to; there's no reason for his team to lock him in.)\n\u201cIf the team then collectively decides that a team member has a right to reimbursement, all team members are to pay their share,\u201d Paperno explained. \u201cAny team member that declines to pay his part, by refusing to sign his end of the transaction, will essentially have his funds locked up, and can lose his own insurance. As such, there is a strong incentive for everyone to contribute to the reimbursement as agreed.\u201d\nGetting Insured\nLet's take a closer look at how this works:\nIf you want to take out car insurance, you could look for a bunch of people on Teambrella who want to take out \u00a0car insurance as well, agree on certain rules, and form a team. Alternatively \u2012 and this will be more likely once Teambrella has established itself \u2012 you look for an existing car insurance team, and simply opt to join.\nTo join a team, you present yourself to that team in whatever way you and the team agree on. Perhaps you upload a picture of your driver\u2019s license, or maybe you provide your previous insurance records or whatever might be helpful.\nAll members of that team then get to vote on what your risk coefficient should be. And, based on that risk coefficient, how much you'll need to relatively chip in when someone needs reimbursement. If the odds of you getting into an accident are higher, for instance because you just got your driver\u2019s license, your team might require you to chip in more when someone needs reimbursement. Or, if you are a very experienced driver with a great track record that will probably not need reimbursements often, the team might be willing to give you a \u201cdiscount.\u201d\nAfter this voting round, the median of all votes is taken, and that median is the offer the team makes you. You can now decide to either take the offer or leave it, or perhaps provide the team with more information and ask for a re-vote.\nOnce accepted into a team, you get to vote on the risk coefficient of new team members as well. Additionally, you might get to vote on new risk coefficients for existing team members that required reimbursement, potential deductibles and more. In essence, almost any rule within a team can be voted on by that team.\nPay-Out\nSuppose you then get into a car accident, and you have $10,000 worth of damage.\nYou would submit a claim to the team for $10,000, including evidence. What kind of evidence, of course, depends on you and the team. Perhaps the team requires a police report, a photo or something else.\nOnce again, each team member gets to vote. This time, team members vote on whether you should be awarded any money, and, if so, how much; this could be anywhere between zero and $10,000. After this voting round, the median of all votes is taken again, and this determines how much all team members must actually pay you. If all goes well, you receive payments from all these team members on your own Bitcoin address.\nPaperno, who\u2019s an expert in game theory, outlined how this voting procedure should incentivize everyone to act honestly.\n\n\u201cVoting is a key part of the Teambrella process. Not only because it determines how much the team pays to a team member that requires reimbursement, but also because voting becomes part of each team member's own reputation. If one team member always votes much lower than all other team members, it potentially lowers the reimbursements made to all team members.\u00a0\n\n\nAs such, the team might be less willing to pay the low-voting team member a decent reimbursement when he needs one himself. Or, if a team member consistently votes much higher, potentially costing everyone money each time a claim is made, the team could be inclined to reimburse him less as well. So it benefits each team member's reputation if he takes the voting process seriously, which will, in turn, benefit his potential reimbursements when he needs it.\u201d\n\nOf course, as with any other insurance, there is always a risk of fraud. Team members can submit unjust claims in order to receive reimbursements where they don\u2019t deserve any. But Paperno expects this problem to be comparable to typical insurance companies, where the cost of this type of fraud is indirectly paid by all customers as well.\nPaperno:\n\n\u201cIn Teambrella, teammates are not limited to a standard set of verification procedures, and may require any amount of additional proofs. Furthermore, fraud against peers is usually much less tolerated than fraud against \u2018the system.\u2019\u201d\n\nExpert Proxys\nAnd there's an important added dimension to the Teambrella platform.\nFirst, when a claim is made, all voting team members receive a bit of money per reimbursement as well. By default, this is 5 percent of the total reimbursement, distributed among all voters. (But the percentage is adjustable per team.)\nPlus, team members can proxy their vote to other team members. And since voting weighs into a team member\u2019s reputation, it makes sense for team members to proxy their votes to an expert who knows what he\u2019s doing. That expert will then receive the voting commission, while the team member won\u2019t need to dig through claims from team members to find out whether they are legitimate.\nThis dynamic, Paperno believes, could make Teambrella a viable alternative to existing insurance companies, as it should ensure no one overpays for their insurance.\nPaperno:\n\n\u201cIf enough team members proxy their vote to an expert within their team, that expert earns more money, and should therefore also be able to invest more time and knowledge in researching the claims, ensuring the votes he issues are fair. This could, in turn, improve his reputation even further, earning him more proxy votes, and therefore more money and time to invest. If teams are big enough, these experts might even make a full-time job out of their expertise. They'd effectively be insurance agents operating in a reputation-based free market environment within Teambrella.\u201d\n\nAnd, making the picture complete:\n\u201cThese experts could also serve as the gatekeepers of each team. Rather than each team member evaluating a potential newcomer themselves, experts can take this job on as well. While the experts will not get paid for this, they might want to do it regardless, as good judgments will benefit their reputation. And it will also be a good point of contact for them to get to know new team members, which could earn them proxy votes as well,\u201d Paperno explained.\nSetup and Risks\nTeambrella is set up as a hybrid model with open source clients, that connect to a central server (which will not be open source from the beginning).\nTeambrella may eventually charge a small fee for use of their platform, but never touches bitcoins used by team members, and there are no private keys stored on their server. So even if that server is compromised, or the project is pressured by authorities, all team members within Teambrella can still get their funds back using only their open source clients (though they'll disband the team by doing so).\nThat doesn\u2019t mean using Teambrella instead of a typical insurance company is without risks - if it\u2019s even allowed (which will vary per insurance and per jurisdiction).\nFor one, there's always a theoretical chance that teams consist of dishonest people. The team could refuse to pay out any funds to a particular team member, or perhaps even \u201chijack\u201d that team member\u2019s wallet by refusing to sign a transaction unless part is paid to the hijackers. In that case, there is no legal recourse, and Teambrella won\u2019t be able to resolve the issue either.\nPaperno expects these types of problems to be rare, however.\n\u201cWe will warn users not to join teams with no friends or friends of friends in them as long-term members. And, of course, it\u2019s also possible to set up teams for people that already have some sort of trust relationship, like colleagues. We expect almost zero hard fraud in these cases,\u201d he said.\nAdditonally, Teambrella will typically offer weak privacy. At least in the first version, Teambrella users will need to create an account through Facebook, which is in itself not very privacy friendly. Moreover, any claim a team member makes will be visible to the entire team. This might in some cases be undesirable; think of health insurance.\nAnd of course, the fact that Teambrella is Bitcoin-based is a risk in itself. As a project, Bitcoin is still experimental, and as a currency, Bitcoin is volatile. Using Bitcoin for insurance exposes users to these risks \u2013 which is perhaps undesirable for very important types of insurances.\nThough, as Paperno pointed out:\n\u201cIn big teams, users don't have to keep large sums in their wallets; they can keep \u2018pay as you go\u2019 amounts, and add funds to the wallets once a week or so.\u201d\u00a0\nAdding:\n\u201cAnd while Bitcoin is indeed volatile, it\u2019s not as volatile as the ruble.\u201d\nLike many Bitcoin projects, Teambrella is experimental, and this article should not be considered an endorsement.

Technology firms both inside and outside the Bitcoin industry are exploring the ways in which non-financial applications and Ethereum-based projects could change our world. \u00a0\nDi Iorio, for the most part, has been at the heart of this in Canada. The nation\u2019s most-headlined FinTech project has been the Royal Canadian Mint\u2019s MintChip project, which recently sold to nanoPay. But Di Iorio has commanded a large part of the remaining attention in Canada on Bitcoin and blockchain.\u00a0\nNow he wants to turn Canada into a financial giant and center of innovation around Bitcoin and blockchain technology.\nDi Iorio, who purchased his first bitcoins in 2012 on LocalBitcoins, has enjoyed a colorful history in Bitcoin. He founded Bitcoin Alliance of Canada and the first Toronto Bitcoin Meetup. The Bitcoin Alliance is a non-profit organization tasked with increasing Bitcoin awareness and adoption in Canada.\u00a0\nHe started the Toronto Bitcoin community meetup where he met Vitalik\u00a0Buterin and Peter Todd and got the idea for the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada amid constant press attention on Bitcoin. He saw news anchors giving people the wrong idea about Bitcoin and saw the value in education.\u00a0\nDi Iorio also launched in 2013 the first Bitcoin Chrome wallet extension, KryptoKit, and co-founded Ethereum with Buterin and others in the summer of 2014. They focused on Ethereum for some time, and recent price action and collaborations have cemented the legitimacy of the project.\u00a0\nAt the beginning of 2014, he launched Decentral, an \u201cinnovation hub for disruptive and decentralized technologies.\u201d The firm offers blockchain and financial technology consulting services and software development.\u00a0\nDi Iorio recently became chief digital officer of the Toronto Stock Exchange. Decentral has worked with the\u00a0TMX Group, which operates the Toronto Stock Exchange, the\u00a0for some time. Further, TMX Group is\u00a0sponsoring the forthcoming\u00a0Blockchain World Expo in Toronto hosted by Decentral and Ethereum Canada.\u00a0\n\"The blockchain has the potential to be as disruptive as the Internet,\" Di Iorio said in a statement. \"It is a comprehensive technology with impacts to be felt in many financial and non\u00adfinancial industries over the coming decades. This is the right time to showcase the many emerging ecosystems, platforms and companies that are at the forefront of this exciting new technology, and Toronto and Canada are well positioned to host this premier event.\"\nDi Iorio\u2019s passion seems to be working with regulators and financial technology executives to propel Canada to the ranks of New York and London for technological innovation: \u201cThat\u2019s my long term vision \u00e2\u20ac\u2019 to propel Canada using my connections and the support of our clients,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nHe plans to do this not only with Bitcoin technology, but any technology inspired by the digital currency and payment system.\u00a0\n\u201cWe understand public blockchains are not the only solution,\u201d Di Iorio explains. \u201cWe try to solve problems. Sometimes, though, problems come down to blockchain tech, and sometimes other technology is better and faster.\u201d \u00a0\nDecentral strives to ensure executives don\u2019t waste time evaluating dead-end\u00a0products and technologies. \u201cWe take a product agnostic approach, and look to see the problem and what technology solutions are out there for them,\u201d he said.\nDi Iorio emphasizes that financial technology firms are not necessarily looking into Bitcoin.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s the underlying technology behind Bitcoin, the blockchain,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThey\u2019re interested in providing solutions; they don\u2019t care what technology it is as long as it works. Sometimes the solution is Ethereum or sometimes it\u2019s colored coins.\nThe emphasis for Di Iorio and Decentral is on distributed technology: \u201cWe are a hub for decentralized technology, we try to have all of our products use decentralized technology to solve problems,\u201d he said. \u201cOur wallets are products where we don\u2019t hold customer funds, or have access to the funds.\u201d\nDi Iorio has helped host more than 100 events since 2012 and believes this deep experience in the blockchain space ensures Decentral boasts the connections and resources needed to adapt to the changing needs of not only the blockchain industry, but financial technology overall.\n\u201cFintech is important,\u201d he says. What Di Iorio\u2019s work for the Toronto Stock Exchange will entail remains to be seen, although sponsoring events such as the World Blockchain Expo could be on that list.\u00a0\nDi Iorio says Decentral\u2019s first year in business was about building up a network and community. After that, he built up connections with larger organizations interested in technology.\u00a0\nFor 2016, Di Iorio resolves to \u201cgrow Canada as a financial powerhouse in the world by working with regulators and letting them know how fantastic the technology is.\u201d\nDi Iorio loves pushing for financial innovation. Although his forte is blockchain and decentralized technologies, he still considers himself a financial technologist. Most of all, he wants everyone to come together.\u00a0\n\u201cThe key is to work together, to collaborate and build up community,\u201d he says.\u00a0\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 1}

Using its Bitcoin wallet, Wiper recently launched a new functionality called Wiper Film to help filmmakers and online digital content providers monetize their content and maximize their profit with Bitcoin micropayments.\nThe company had previously raised $2.5 million in seed funding from sole investor and Intermedia and Unison founder Michael Choupak, to develop a unique set of cryptographic functionalities which encrypts all incoming and outgoing messages and HD calls.\nThe core concept of the Wiper application was inspired by the frustration that co-founders Manilo Carrelli and Michael Choupak felt while using conventional messaging platforms such as Whatsapp, Facebook and Skype, which do not allow users from removing their messages and content due to compliance issues. Anyone on the Wiper network can instantly and permanently delete sensitive user data and messages from the Wiper database and servers.\u00a0\nTo provide an additional level of security to its users, Wiper also developed and integrated its \u00a0Bitcoin wallet, which allows Wiper messenger users to send micropayments to each other with a touch of a button, securely and instantly. The wallet is the basis for the new Wiper Film functionality.\nWiper Film is a $4.99 a month subscription available for all Wiper messenger users that grants access to hundreds of independent films. Content providers will receive a fair share of the revenue in Bitcoin, that will be paid through Wiper Bitcoin wallets. In essence, Wiper Film is like traditional advertising networks Google AdSense or YouTube advertisements, which incentivizes content providers with an appropriate share of the ad revenue based on the popularity of the content. But instead of using existing payment methods such as PayPal or bank wire transfers, Wiper Film pays its filmmakers in Bitcoin.\nOne major advantage for filmmakers on the Wiper network is that they are able to receive Bitcoin payments with a minimum threshold that is substantially lower than the payment thresholds of Google and other leading advertising networks. Since Bitcoin micropayments are far cheaper than conventional payment methods, digital content providers will be able to receive their share of the income in smaller dividends.\u00a0\nOn Google for example, content providers are required to wait until they reach a minimum threshold of $100 before cashing out. While major filmmakers and digital content providers drive tens of thousands of dollars per month in profit, freelance and independent filmmakers generate a much smaller income and thus struggle to reach that threshold each time they publish or release their content.\nFurthermore, Bitcoin payments are instantaneous. That means that digital content providers on the Wiper network will no longer have to wait for a week to two to receive their payments, unlike Google or AOL advertising networks, which require 5 to 10 business days as a minimum payment settlement period for users.\nThe Wiper team raised an additional $2 million from its previous investor Michael Choupak and plans to focus on the development and distribution of Wiper Film throughout 2016.", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 4}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nCoinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam recently appeared on the 1776 Podcast, where he was asked about the adoption of Bitcoin in the United States and international markets. While there has been a lot of noise related to merchant acceptance and use cases in developing countries, the reality is there still aren\u2019t as many people using Bitcoin today as some expected.\nEhrsam noted that there probably aren\u2019t that many Bitcoin users in the developing world, which is often touted as one of the technology\u2019s major demographics. He then covered two of the current roadblocks to greater Bitcoin adoption: education and ease-of-use.\nWhat\u2019s Holding Back Bitcoin Adoption?\nIn Ehrsam\u2019s view, the knowledge gap is what\u2019s holding back Bitcoin at this point in time. While it\u2019s easy for technically-savvy individuals to understand why Bitcoin is useful (or may be useful in the future), the average person on the street is still looking at the digital value-transfer system with bewilderment. Ehrsam explained:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a huge knowledge gap \u2026. There are two primary things that I think will close that gap. One is some base level of knowledge. The second is services that are built such that these people don\u2019t really have to understand the underlying protocols in the first place.\u201d\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s unclear to the moms, dads, grandparents and less technically inclined friends of Bitcoin users why they should use this new technology. The vast majority of users are still simply holding the digital store of value as a speculation, and potential new users are often turned off by the complexities associated with Bitcoin applications. This is a point that Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winkless and Blockchain Capital Managing Partner Brock Pierce have all made in the past.\nMost People Don\u2019t Know How Email Works\nEhrsam also stated that completely new technologies are also sometimes extremely difficult to grasp, even for highly educated individuals. He pointed to the infamous \u201cWhat is Internet?\u201d clip from an episode of \u201cThe Today Show\u201d in the \u201890s as an example of this phenomenon.\nEhrsam also noted that, even today, most people don\u2019t understand how various Internet protocols work. He stated:\n\n\u201cThe reality of today is you could go up to many different people on the street \u2012 maybe even around the offices here [at 1776] \u2012 and say, \u2018Hey. How does email work? How does SMTP work (the protocol that underlies email)?\u2019 I\u2019m guessing that less than 10 percent of people could give you a solid answer, but the reality is that we all use it every day anyway.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Needs More Intuitive Apps\nAlthough many people do not understand Bitcoin, that does not mean it cannot be a useful technology for large amounts of people. In Ehrsam\u2019s view, the key to mainstream adoption is building intuitive apps that normal people can use. He explained:\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s our job in the ecosystem to create software and applications, which bridge the gap without necessarily this entire learning process on the underlying technology, which really is irrelevant, I think, to the end-customer.\u201d\n\n1776 co-founder Evan Burfield, who was also featured on the recent podcast, added:\n\u201cI don\u2019t think an entrepreneur trying to do business across multiple African countries needs to understand the concept of Bitcoin miners to figure out that he can do business in a more secure way with lower transaction costs [via Bitcoin].\u201d\nEhrsam agreed and added, \u201cThe particulars are less relevant.\u201d\nSome Bitcoin applications, such as Abra and Freemit, are moving toward the model of hiding the underlying technology from their users. This strategy may continue to expand as Bitcoin startups begin to target individuals outside of the digital currency community.\n\u00a0\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

Fund transfer and payment companies believe they could lose as much as 28 percent of their business to fintech startups over the next five years, while bankers see themselves losing 24 percent of their business.\nOn a related note, the banking and payments sectors also appear to be the most knowledgeable among the respondents when it comes to the potential of blockchain technology. The fund transfer and payments industry held the highest level of confidence in their understanding of the blockchain, with 30 percent of respondents claiming to be very familiar with the technology. Sixty percent of respondents from the banking sector said they were at least moderately familiar with the technology.\nPwC Sees Many Benefits to the Blockchain\nPwC has already made deals with blockchain startups Blockstream and Bloq, and the professional services network also made bullish claims about the technology in its report such as:\n\n\u201cIn our view, blockchain technology may result in a radically different competitive future in the [financial services] industry, where current profit pools are disrupted and redistributed toward the owners of new, highly efficient blockchain platforms.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the possible back-office savings offered to financial institutions, PwC also sees value in using the blockchain for more-efficient regulatory compliance and increased transparency.\nThe report also points out the potential value of smart contracts:\n\n\u201cOne particular hot topic is that of \u2018smart contracts\u2019 \u2013 contracts that are translated into computer programs and, as such, have the ability to be self-executing and self-maintaining. This area is\u00a0just starting to be explored, but its potential for automating and speeding up manual and costly processes is huge.\u201d\n\nPwC has identified 700 companies entering the blockchain space, and they believe 150 of them are worthy of being tracked. Additionally, PwC believes 25 of these companies are likely to emerge as industry leaders.\nFinancial Services Industry Underestimating the Blockchain\nAlthough 56 percent of the respondents to PwC\u2019s survey recognize the importance of the blockchain, 57 percent say they are unsure or unlikely to respond to this new technology. PwC\u2019s report claims that this seemingly conflicting dynamic could be caused by the general lack of understanding of the technology by respondents. The report notes:\n\n\u201c83 percent of respondents are at best \u2018moderately\u2019 familiar with it and only very few consider themselves to be experts. This lack of understanding may lead market participants to underestimate the potential impact of blockchain on their activities.\u201d\n\nComments from at least one fintech startup\u2019s CEO could lend credibility to this particular finding from PwC\u2019s report. At this year\u2019s World Economic Forum in Davos, TransferWise CEO Taavet Hinrikus stated that the blockchain is \u201cexciting,\u201d but he also fell short of claiming his company has any plans of experimenting with blockchain technology in the near future.\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nMany people in the Bitcoin community see OpenBazaar as the next iteration of darknet marketplaces, but the first version of this network will not be suitable for those attempting to sell goods or services in an anonymous manner. During a recent guest appearance at the Coinscrum Members Club, OB1 CEO and OpenBazaar project lead Brian Hoffman discussed anonymity on the OpenBazaar network, and he noted that these features have been deferred to a future section of the development roadmap.\nAt one point during the Q&A session, Hoffman stated, \u201cRight now, it\u2019s fairly obvious, based on your connection information, where you are or where you\u2019re running it from and things like that.\u201d\nPrivacy and Anonymity Are Key Features for OpenBazaar\nAlthough OpenBazaar will not offer anonymity to its users by default in its first full release, the team behind the project view this feature as a fundamental aspect of the protocol. During his recent appearance at the Coinscrum Members Club, Hoffman said, \u201cI think [anonymity] is, without a doubt, one of the most important, fundamental things that we need to have in OpenBazaar.\u201d\nHoffman added:\n\n\u201cIf you hear anybody say that we don\u2019t care about that, it\u2019s patently false. We definitely do. It just becomes a matter of how you do that gracefully without scaring off any other clearnet type users.\u201d\n\nHoffman also noted that a roadmap for incorporating more anonymity into OpenBazaar has been developed.\nGrowing OpenBazaar on the Clearnet\nThe plan to avoid anonymity for now should not be viewed as a dismissal of the need for this type of functionality. Instead, the deferment of these features to a later date is part of a grander vision. Hoffman described the OpenBazaar developers\u2019 perspective on anonymity during his recent Coinscrum Members Club appearance by asking a question:\n\n\u201cWhat is the best way to bootstrap a decentralized, private marketplace without basically inviting all of the darknet marketplaces to just shift their stock onto this and scare the crap out of any potential normal user from joining OpenBazaar?\u201d\n\nHoffman then explained that deferment of anonymity for users would be the best strategy to help the network attract more buyers and sellers over the long term:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve basically deferred it to a little bit later in the development process. This, we hope, will give us time to establish a baseline of nodes on the network and liquidity of items without overwhelming it with just darknet items.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s possible that portions of the OpenBazaar network could become the new, decentralized hub of darknet commerce, the developers behind the project also want to see the general public use the platform for legal commerce.\nTechnical Reasons for Deferment\nIn addition to the strategic reasons for temporarily avoiding anonymity, the OpenBazaar team is also currently avoiding Tor integration for technical reasons. Hoffman explained:\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons we\u2019ve also deferred it technically is that we\u2019re using a UDP network. If you\u2019re not familiar with that, it\u2019s not compatible with Tor, which is kind of the primary [anonymizing network].\u201d\n\nHoffman said the team is also looking at i2p as a possible option for anonymizing users. He added that some of the i2p developers are already starting to collaborate with the OpenBazaar team.\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

The NeuCoin team announced that the number of NeuCoin users has surpassed the 275,000 mark, which puts NeuCoin on track for acquiring more than 2 million users in 2016.\nNeuCoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency developed by a team of designers, game developers, security consultants\u00a0and legal advisers funded by executives of King, Uber, Jango, Spotify and Hotline. Its developers' unified vision was to maximize decentralization and enable micropayments, which are typically difficult to settle with existing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin due to expensive transaction fees.\nJango Radio\nJango Radio, founded by serial entrepreneur Kaufman, is one of the most popular online radio and music streaming platforms that\u00a0enables users to create and share custom radio stations. In 2007, Jango was the first music streaming platform to introduce a social network technology that allows the platform to\u00a0match\u00a0users with listeners who have identical musical preferences. The radio playlist and user matching service led to exponential growth for\u00a0Jango. A few years after its launch, the platform reached more than 7 million monthly users.\nThe developers and founders behind Jango integrated the NeuCoin tipping technology onto their platform as a core section of its user interface in late 2015, to introduce a digital currency that mainstream users can embrace and use to tip others in the community.\n\"The main reason that Bitcoin and other digital currencies haven't been widely adopted is that they don't provide benefits over traditional currencies that mainstream consumers care about,\u201d Kaufman said. \u201cMany believe that new business models and behaviors based on micropayments (transactions from $.01 to $1.00) where traditional payment methods just aren't viable might be digital currency's killer app. Armed with freemium distribution, this is NeuCoin's focus,\u201d he further explained.\nAs a part of its initiative, the Jango team recently began to reward one to two NeuCoins to regular users per day. Due to this promotional offer from the Jango team, more than 30,000 listeners have tipped NeuCoin to more than 25,000 emerging artists. The mainstream exposure to millions of music enthusiasts and artists led to a rapid growth in the userbase of NeuCoin.\nThe NeuCoin team reported that more than 150,000 users from Jango converted to NeuCoin in the first four weeks and that the user base of NeuCoin has been growing by 8,000 users per day. They further emphasized that such a rapid rate of growth is unusual for an alternative digital currency like NeuCoin, and not many cryptocurrencies are embraced by the mainstream.\nFacebook Game: Solitaire Racer\nThe NeuCoin team also secured a partnership with the developers of the popular Facebook game Solitaire Racer and integrated the NeuCoin tipping technology onto the application.\nSimilar to traditional Solitaire card games, the gameplay of Solitaire Racer is fairly simple. Users are required to sort the card deck as soon as possible and beat out other players in the game by speed. However, the NeuCoin integration provides users with an added twist: Users earn NeuCoins for completing a deck and receive additional NeuCoins if they complete the deck first. The game enables users to transfer NeuCoins earned during the gameplay to their official NeuCoin wallets or trade them for cash or bitcoins.\nThe introduction of NeuCoin to a passionate gaming community led to an unexpected growth of its user base and daily volume, establishing the currency as a viable alternative currency to Bitcoin.\nDecrease in Coin Supply\nThe NeuCoin Foundation recently announced that the the foundation\u2019s holdings will be cut from 3.2 billion to 1 billion in the next several weeks by destroying 2.2 billion coins to decrease the NeuCoin supply by 50 percent. The foundation came to a consensus that such decline in the coin supply could maximize the value of the digital currency.\n\u201cFirst and foremost, given the learnings that fewer coins need to be distributed per person to consumers, and that ecosystem partners do not require large rewards, the foundation will destroy 70 percent of their NeuCoin holdings. This cuts the current total coin supply by roughly 50 percent to 2B and cuts the projected coin supply in 10 years time to 10B,\u201d announced the NeuCoin foundation.\nPhoto:\u00a0Freepik\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 17}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nSamson Mow is the Chief Operating Officer of Chinese Bitcoin exchange, wallet service and mining pool\u00a0BTCC. A successful executive in the video game industry, Mow joined the Bitcoin company run by his friend and CEO Bobby Lee as an adviser last year, and has gotten further involved with the company ever since.\nMow has actively engaged himself in the block size dispute over the past months. He played a key role in realizing both the\u00a0Bitcoin Roundtable letter, as well as the\u00a0Hong Kong Roundtable Consensus.\nBut his real claim to fame in the Bitcoin space might actually have been a\u00a0series\u00a0of\u00a0tweetstorms \u2013 lauded by some, dismissed as unprofessional by others. Bitcoin Magazine interviewed Mow on, among other things, his newly heightened media profile and his perspective on the block size dispute.\nSamson, until recently you were a somewhat calm executive not many people in Bitcoin had heard of. If nothing else, your Twitter escapades have hurled you into the center of attention. What's gotten into you?\nOn Twitter I'm mostly satirizing the situation. It's become too ridiculous. Everything gets turned into a conspiracy theory and people are quick to dismiss anything that doesn't align with their views. Between all of the misinformation and claims without any factual basis, we have passive aggressive attacks on the Bitcoin Core development team as well. There's not much else you can do aside from laughing at the situation.\nYou used to be quite critical of the Bitcoin Core development team yourself.\u00a0Last time we spoke\u00a0you even said that stakeholders might implement a block size limit increase if Bitcoin Core reached no consensus.\nThe key message was that something needed to happen. The community was frustrated, and I was frustrated as well.\nThat interview actually lead to a three-hour call with Blockstream president Adam Back, where I gave Adam a lot of criticism about Core in general, but mainly about how they were not communicating well enough. He was receptive to my feedback, as were Core developers, and they have indeed\u00a0improved their communication significantly since.\nI also managed to get a better understanding of how the Core developers actually work together, and came to the conclusion that a lot of the frustration was misplaced. I learned that I couldn't actually complain to just Adam and expect things to be magically resolved. Core is a very diverse group of individual volunteers as well as companies that donate the time from their employees. There are also a lot of differing opinions within the group. They can't simply react to people's feedback \u2013 there's no mechanism. It's just a bunch of guys that want to write code and solve problems pertaining to Bitcoin. There's no one in charge.\nWladimir van der Laan is in charge.\nWladimir merges code, as he is the maintainer, but he doesn't make decisions on anything without the group\u2019s rough consensus. That's actually something people have criticized him on \u2013 that he is too cautious, and things are not getting anywhere because he doesn't take a decision on matters.\nWell, he is the one who decides when rough consensus is reached.\nI don't think he is the judge. He is a facilitator. If he would merge code without consensus, there wouldn\u2019t be many developers left in the project.\nNow we're stuck at an artificial 1-megabyte block size limit. But in December weren\u2019t you in favor of a short-term bump yourself?\nSatoshi Nakamoto set the block size limit at 1 megabyte to prevent spam. But the block size limit has another function; it maintains a low bar for anyone to run a full node, which serves to promote decentralization. Last time I checked, an important property of Bitcoin is that it is decentralized.\nMy initial preference was to do a hard fork first, but since then I've learned a lot more about Segregated Witness and why it needs to come first: to prevent certain attacks. If we don't focus on these weaknesses, we may end up seeing more problems, like manufactured transactions that destabilize the network.\nThe Core developers want to both maintain network security as well as decentralization, so naturally they are cautious to increase the block size set by Satoshi. They are also actually increasing the effective block size with Segregated Witness. And as part of the Hong Kong Roundtable Consensus, some have already committed to a hard fork for another increase. I'm not sure how you can call that artificially restraining the block size.\nSome say the limit is being kept in place by a small group of developers.\nWell, if you define \u201csmall group\u201d as the Core development team, which is about 80 contributors, then technically you could say they are keeping the block size limit in place.\nHowever, they can only keep it in place as long as there is consensus to do so \u2013 and there is, because it benefits the entire Bitcoin ecosystem. If the Core developers just decided to raise the block size limit to 8 megabytes today, miners would block that unanimously because it would be a massive detriment to mining.\nNow, if you changed your question slightly, you could state \u201cthe 21 million coin limit is being kept in place by a small group of developers.\u201d If you look at the question from that perspective, then you'll see that the Core team is not keeping anything in place. It's ridiculous to think they alone could enforce the 21 million coin limit \u2013 it's the ecosystem enforcing the limit.\nYou were referring to the Hong Kong Roundtable Agreement. How did that come about?\nIt started with the Bitcoin Roundtable that BitFury organized at the North-American Bitcoin Conference, followed with a series of calls discussing the issues amongst many stakeholders, and after that, the publication of the \"A Call for Consensus\" letter. We then heard from Pindar Wong \u2013 a\u00a0Scaling Bitcoin Workshop organizer \u2013 who offered us some space for meetings. Kang Xie, an active member from the Bitcoin community, played a very important role in setting the stage.\nThe meeting itself was very ad hoc. Many people, including myself, only confirmed that we would attend a few days prior \u2013 or on even shorter notice. We just decided to meet and discuss the issues, with the hope that we could avoid a contentious hard fork. The fact that we were able to come to an agreement and produce a\u00a0letter, well, that's actually really amazing.\nNo one from the Bitcoin Classic team attended. Was that your intention?\nOur goal was to keep this a very small meeting with a razor sharp focus: figure out what it would take to have a hard fork from the Core team and avoid a network split. We wanted to cap it at 20 people but ended up with around 24.\nWe didn't want to bring non-developers or people who would not contribute to the discussion in a meaningful way. After some discussion we did extend invitations to Bitcoin Classic developers Gavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik and Jonathan Toomim.\nBut only on very short notice ....\nSure, but this was not a conference. As I said, it was an ad hoc meeting. A lot of people decided at the last minute to attend. The Bitcoin Classic developers did not. I believe some of them attended the Financial Crypto conference in Barbados instead.\nIt must not have been easy to come to consensus in Hong Kong?\nIt wasn\u2019t easy at all. The single biggest issue that kept popping up was the actual increase of the block size limit. That's why we settled on \u201caround 2 MB\u201d for the purpose of finishing the letter. If we settled on a base block size of 2 megabytes, the effective size with Segregated Witness would be 3.6, and possibly 8 under adversarial conditions. But we won't really know the exact size without more discussions between developers and the mining community. If miners and pools are OK with 2 megabytes, that will be fine, but it could end up being slightly smaller.\nPeople with a simplistic understanding of Bitcoin want a block size that's easy to understand, like 2. But it's just not that simple. We've long passed the point where the block size can just be [an] arbitrary number \u2013 that was during the time of Satoshi. We're now at the point where block size should be determined by technical and network constraints.\nMoreover, people need to stop focusing on the actual block size and start concerning themselves with the number of transactions per block, which is what really matters.\nNot everyone seems very happy about the outcome, though. At least two pool operators \u2013 F2Pool's Wang Chun and AntPool's Jihan Wu \u2013 indicated they want their hashers to vote?\nEveryone is a bit frustrated, but there is no problem with them offering their users a chance to vote. F2Pool is technically not running Bitcoin Classic. Maybe there was a bit of misunderstanding there ... or a bit of a loophole in the agreement. We agreed to give Core more time. I have faith that everyone will keep their word and stick to the commitments made in the letter.\nThe Bitcoin Core developers present at the Roundtable signed on their own behalf, not on behalf of Bitcoin Core. What if there's no consensus among Core developers by the time the hard fork should roll out?\nYes, they committed as individuals. As mentioned before, Bitcoin Core is not a monolith \u2013 it's not a company. The Core contributors present could not speak on behalf of other contributors any more than we could speak on behalf of KnCMiner, who did not attend.\nIt was actually Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd who led the charge on committing as individuals. He made a bold move and said he would commit to the dates as part of the agreement. He and AntPool's Jihan Wu both made a huge effort to bring people together toward the end of the meeting.\nAs for consensus among the Core development team ... we're giving them time to decide amongst themselves. Ultimately, it is really up to them as to what happens next. We have high hopes they will agree with the opinions of the contributors that signed, and some \u2013 like Wladimir - signaled that they do support the agreement. What's ultimately going to end the debate is code being written.\nWhile an important achievement, the Hong Kong Roundtable was only among a relatively small group of people. What about the rest of the community? What about other companies and miners, not to mention users?\nThe Roundtable group is doing everything we can to bring together more of the industry players, but it's an uphill battle.\nFor users, we need a method to signal what they actually want. This was discussed as part of a hard fork plan \u2013 maybe some way to let users vote with their bitcoins. There\u2019s nothing concrete yet.\u00a0\nUltimately, it's not a given that the rest of the community will support the Hong Kong agreement. If it were a given, then Bitcoin would be easy to change, and no longer unique or special.\u00a0\nAt least a part of the community is already disagreeing. They think Segregated Witness won't be ready in time, and the hard fork will be too little, too late.\nIt's never too late. The important thing is that the community needs to understand it\u2019s being manipulated.\nBy whom?\nThe Bitcoin Classic team and their supporters. It's a play for control and influence. Potentially over Bitcoin itself.\nThey\u2019ve turned a seemingly innocuous issue, the block size debate, into a vehicle to compromise consensus rules. That\u2019s a very slippery slope and dangerous precedent.\nThey\u2019ve listed supporters on their website who had no idea they were listed, or companies who said they supported a 2 megabyte increase, not that they supported a hard fork by Classic.\nWe've also been seeing a huge spam attack on the network at the same time these people were screaming that we are hitting the current block size limit. Either they were in on the attack, or they are oblivious to the fact that there was an attack \u2013 both of which don't reflect well on them.\nThey then direct blame to the Core developers, and present themselves as the saviors of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not easy to fully understand \u2013 even some executives of major Bitcoin companies have absolutely no idea how Bitcoin really works. So, if you have these people oversimplifying scaling issues to be just an increase from 1 to 2 megabytes, most of the community will not know any better and just follow along. It\u2019s easier to be outraged than logical.\nBlocks were indeed filling up for a couple of days. But who gets to say if something is spam, or legitimate use of the Blockchain?\nIt's an attack if some person or group is intentionally disrupting normal operations for most people on the network. We're seeing wallets sending coins to themselves over and over, spending unconfirmed transactions repeatedly, sending a high volume of low fee transactions, and constantly requesting large blocks to max out bandwidth.\nSure, you can say that these are not attacks and we should allow everyone to use Bitcoin as they see fit, but let's try a simpler example. If someone loots all the toilet paper from the public toilet, is that a bad thing? Is the solution to double the amount of toilet paper stocked each day?\nPutting the attack aside, block space is a limited resource. Increasing the block size to 2 megabytes doesn't solve anything. There will always be ways to spam transactions as long as the attacker is willing to pay. We need smarter ways to filter out non-standard transactions and wallets that are smarter at estimating fees, but fees will always and must be a factor in getting transactions into blocks.\nAre you saying it's OK to price people out of transacting on-chain?\nIf Satoshi intended that everything should be done on-chain forever, there would be no block reward halvings. A better term for the block rewards is \u201cblock subsidy.\u201d Everyone pays low fees now because their transactions are subsidized by the block rewards. Since block space is a limited resource, you have to be willing to pay for it \u2013 this is the fundamental concept of economics: supply and demand.\nIf people insist that everything must be on-chain and free, they are welcome to provide that service \u2013 they can invest a few million dollars to build a data center, buy mining equipment, and then mine low fee transactions as a public service.\nYour company introduced a service called BlockPriority, which guarantees that transactions to and from BTCC are included in the first block BTCC mines. Bitcoin Classic developer Gavin Andresen pointed out\u00a0that is a symptom of an unhealthy network that is becoming increasingly unreliable and vulnerable to attacks.\nBlockPriority does not offer any indications whatsoever about the health of the Bitcoin network.\nBlockPriority is, however, indicative of vectors for spam attacks on the network that have yet to be patched, the need for better methods for estimation of fees, and the need for Bitcoin businesses to adopt Segregated Witness which will increase block size.\nIdeally we wouldn't try to make everything about block size. But I guess if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\nWell, obviously some people do believe that an increased block size limit is the solution Bitcoin needs right now. Bitcoin Classic is offering a concrete alternative. What's wrong with that?\nClassic has been marketing their hard fork as consensus, when consensus just wants a hard fork, not their hard fork.\nClassic's hard fork is an assault on the network, and it is contentious. There are people that say it doesn't fix the attack vectors that Segregated Witness addresses. There are people who don't have confidence in the team behind the project, as it's been constantly changing in just the few weeks they have been together. There are people who think there's no real solution in Classic and that their roadmap lacks substance. There are people, like myself, who think the 75 percent mining threshold is too low for activation, and that the 28-day grace period is an irresponsibly short time for people to upgrade. And there are Core developers who say they will cease working on Bitcoin if a small vocal minority can co-opt the project by changing consensus rules.\nBitcoin Classic represents a small minority?\nYes. We have the Hong Kong Consensus to show there is broad support for a hard fork done together with the Core team.\nBitcoin Classic has gathered a lot of support as well, though. And Gavin Andresen even led the Bitcoin project for several years... surely you're not questioning his expertise?\nI actually do question his expertise post BIP 101 and Bitcoin XT. It would have been a disaster if that was adopted. The proposed exponential growth for block sizes would have probably destroyed the network. In fact, even the initial bump to 8-megabyte blocks would have been too big for the network to handle, but it was marketed to everyone as being a safe solution for scaling.\nGavin played a very important role in Bitcoin\u2019s formative years. However, he stepped away from being the maintainer, and largely has not contributed much since then. There are a lot of new people who are actively working on Bitcoin to address security issues and even more who are coming up with ways to extend it past layer 1.\nThe way I see it, Gavin took care of Bitcoin while it was an infant, and I think we are all appreciative of that. However, now we have people who are teaching that child physics and chemistry. The codebase has been largely re-written. We're doing a lot more advanced features and will need to do far more to ensure its growth \u2013 we cannot only look to past contributors for guidance.\nSo where do we look for guidance within the mess that this block size dispute has become?\nWe need to look to the people who are actively contributing, either through writing code, donating time or funding development. We need to look to the people who are focused on solving difficult technical problems. We need to look to the people developing new technologies like the Lightning Network. Most important, we need to look to those who are trying to be collaborative and productive.\nI believe cooler heads will prevail. What we have is a very loud, and very vocal minority trying to cause a commotion. As long as the community can see through the manipulation, keep calm and write code, we can move forward.", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 15}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin Core, descendant of the original Bitcoin software launched by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, has always been Bitcoin's reference client. The implementation, formerly known as Bitcoin QT, proposes standards for the Bitcoin protocol itself. But these standards are not binding. Based on open source software, anyone can take the code, modify it as they see fit, and offer the adjusted version to the world.\nThis was recently\u00a0 highlighted by the launch of\u00a0 Bitcoin Classic and\u00a0 Bitcoin Unlimited, and\u00a0 Bitcoin XT before that. But these implementations did something that hadn't been attempted before, at least not in serious form. They forked the software such that it could become incompatible with Bitcoin's existing consensus rules, essentially proposing that users switch to a network that is not backwards-compatible. Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin XT are not just software forks, they are\u00a0 consensus forks.\nForking Bitcoin Core's software itself, however, has been done several times before without raising consensus issues. At least three prominent developers, all of whom contribute to Bitcoin Core, maintain their own forks, adjusted to fit their vision and preferred use cases for Bitcoin. Because none of these break with existing consensus rules, they are fully compatible with the current Bitcoin network.\nBitcoin RBF (by Peter Todd)\n\u201cBitcoin RBF\u201d (it has no official name) is a Bitcoin Core fork maintained by Peter Todd, and was launched in early 2014. It's a straight copy of Bitcoin Core, except for its memory pool (\u201cmempool\u201d) policy: the rules that decide which unconfirmed transactions are accepted and rejected.\nMost Bitcoin nodes currently apply a \u201cfirst seen\u201d mempool policy, which means they reject incoming transactions if they conflict with earlier unconfirmed transactions. And Bitcoin Core recently introduced \u201copt-in replace-by-fee,\u201d which replaces a transaction with a conflicting transaction that includes a higher fee \u2013 but only if the initial transaction was specifically flagged by the sender to allow this. These policies make it harder \u2013 but not impossible \u2013 to double-spend unconfirmed transactions.\nBitcoin RBF, instead, applies full replace-by-fee, which means it replaces unconfirmed transactions any time a newer \u2013 conflicting \u2013 transaction pays a higher fee. This allows senders to, among other advantages, get a transaction \u201cun-stuck\u201d if the Bitcoin network is bearing a heavy load. It also allows users to double-spend unconfirmed transactions more easily.\nFurthermore, to ensure that unconfirmed double-spends propagate across the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin RBF includes special networking code. This connects Bitcoin RBF to other Bitcoin RBF nodes, in addition to nodes that do not apply replace-by-fee. As such, users who want to broadcast a conflicting unconfirmed transaction really only need to connect to one Bitcoin RBF node; the transaction will find its way over the network from there.\nImportantly, however, Bitcoin RBF is not at odds with Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain-based consensus model; mempool and transaction relay policies cannot be.\nTodd does not really aim for mainstream adoption of Bitcoin RBF. A small minority of users running the implementation allows conflicting unconfirmed transactions to reach miners (even if these miners don't run Bitcoin RBF.) This already makes it\u00a0 relatively\u00a0easy to replace some unconfirmed transactions.\nAnd if miners (or pools) choose to run Bitcoin RBF themselves, full replace-by-fee could even become common policy on the whole network, proportional to the amount of hash power represented by these miners. Major Chinese mining pool F2Pool adopted Bitcoin RBF for a very short period of time last year, but has since switched back to typical mempool policy. Whether any other miners run Bitcoin RBF is unclear.\nFor more information on replace-by-fee, see: 'The Case for Replace-by-fee (and the Case Against)'.\nBitcoin Knots (by Luke Dashjr)\nBitcoin Knots (until recently known as Bitcoin LJR) is a Bitcoin Core fork maintained by Luke Dashjr, and was launched in 2011. The name is a nod to the biblical passage in which Jesus expels the money changers from the Temple with a whip of knots (Dashjr is Catholic), and also refers to merging code.\nCompared to Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Knots offers significantly more mempool and mining configurability to node operators and miners. Node operators and miners should have that configurability, Dashjr believes, because they need to verify, store and transmit transactions and blocks over the Bitcoin network; all of which comes at a cost to them.\nWith Bitcoin Knots, node operators and miners can enable first-seen, opt-in replace-by-fee, as well as full replace-by-fee mempool policies, plus select a myriad of additional conditions to accept or reject (unconfirmed) transactions. Miners, furthermore, can easily lower the maximum size of blocks they mine, from 1 megabyte downward. They can also change the priority size in blocks reserved for bitcoins that have not been used for a while, and can adjust how many low-fee transactions they are willing to include: two anti-spam measures.\nAnd again, none of this is at odds with Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain-based consensus model.\nLastly, Bitcoin Knots serves as a testbed for Bitcoin Core to some extent. Dashjr often implements software optimizations that are adopted by Bitcoin Core at a later stage. Since having rebranded his implementation as Bitcoin Knots and marketing it towards a wider audience, Dashjr took a slightly more conservative approach, however. He now only includes optimizations that he considers reasonably secure.\nBitcoin Knots has been\u00a0adopted by a number of miners, including the relatively small mining pool Eligius, which Dashjr launched in 2011, but is currently run by \u201cwizkid057.\u201d\nBitcoin Addrindex (by BtcDrak)\nBitcoin Addrindex is a Bitcoin Core fork maintained by the pseudonymous developer \u201cBtcDrak,\u201d and was launched in late 2014. Bitcoin Addrindex is a straight copy of Bitcoin Core with one added feature: It allows users to look up any Bitcoin address to explore its history, much like a typical block explorer.\nBitcoin Addrindex is especially useful for applications built on top of Bitcoin's blockchain: these don't need to rely on a (centralized) API to fetch blockchain data. Bitcoin Addrindex currently powers\u00a0 CounterParty and CounterParty block explorer\u00a0 Blockscan. It could potentially be adopted by a variation of other services, including block explorers, wallets and more.\nBitcoin Addrindex is not really designed for average Bitcoin users, as the added feature has no convenient user interface. Bitcoin Addrindex is specifically intended as a building block for programmers.\nNote: Bitcoin Magazine\u00a0 has not tested or reviewed the code of any of these implementations. \u00a0Thanks to Bryan Bishop for added suggestions.\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 17}

Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England (BoE), hinted at the possibility that the U.K. government might issue a digital currency.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat I think is now reasonably clear is that the distributed payment technology embodied in Bitcoin has real potential,\u201d said Haldane. \u201cBitcoin\u2019s \u2018blockchain\u2019 technology appears to offer an imaginative solution to that distributed trust problem. That is why work on central bank-issued digital currencies forms a core part of the [BoE]\u2019s current research agenda.\u201d\nHaldane left as open questions whether blockchain technology could support central bank-issued digital currency, and whether the public would accept it as a substitute for paper currency.\u00a0\nEarlier this month, Ben Broadbent, BoE\u2019s deputy governor, said that distributed ledger technology could make retail payments more efficient and the financial system as a whole more resilient.\u00a0\n\u201cThe main point here is that the important innovation in bitcoin isn\u2019t the alternative unit of account \u2013 it seems very unlikely that, to any significant extent, we\u2019ll ever be paying for things in bitcoins, rather than pounds, dollars or euros \u2013 but its settlement technology, the so-called \u2018distributed ledger,\u2019\u201d he said.\u00a0\nBroadbent confirmed that the BoE is actively pursuing distributed ledger research, and added that a central bank digital currency would involve putting reserve deposits on a distributed ledger.\n\u201cThe issue of digital currencies forms an important part of our One Bank Research Agenda,\u201d concluded Broadbent. \u201cIn publishing the Agenda a year ago, we asked for help, hoping to encourage \u2018the wider academic community\u2019 to think about the big policy questions.\u201d\u00a0\nThe One Bank Research Agenda paper noted that blockchain fintech could reshape the financial industry and called for further research to devise a system that could use distributed ledger technology without compromising a central bank\u2019s ability to control its currency.\nNow, British researchers have invented a Bitcoin-like system that could make digital cash more practical by allowing a central bank such as the Federal Reserve to control it, MIT Technology Review reports.\u00a0\nUniversity College London researchers George Danezis and Sarah Meiklejohn presented a paper titled \u201cCentrally Banked Cryptocurrencies\u201d at the Network & Distributed System Security Symposium in San Diego last month. The paper, which acknowledges contributions from the BoE, introduces RSCoin, \u201ca cryptocurrency framework that decouples the generation of the monetary supply from the maintenance of the transaction ledger.\u201d\n\u201cOur design decisions were largely motivated by the desire to create a more scalable cryptocurrency, but were also inspired by the research agenda of the Bank of England, and the question of \u2018whether central banks should themselves make use of such technology to issue digital currencies,\u2019\u201d note the researchers. \u201cIndeed, as Bitcoin becomes increasingly widespread, we expect that this will be a question of interest to many central banks around the world.\u201d\nRSCoin would be a closed, \u201cpermissioned\u201d blockchain offering the advantages of digital currencies \u2013 fast and cheap transactions permanently recorded in a shared distributed ledger \u2013 without the troublesome openness of the Bitcoin network where anyone can be an anonymous node on the network. Instead of anonymous miners, only the central bank and vetted financial operators would be allowed to validate RSCoin transactions.\u00a0\nPermissioned blockchains are supported by, among others, Accenture and Digital Asset Holdings CEO Blythe Masters, but others, including legendary cryptographer Nick Szabo, strongly argue that financial operators should, instead, embrace the crowd-sourced power and resiliency of permissionless blockchains like Bitcoin.\nRSCoin would be controlled by the central bank, which would also retain a special encryption key that could be used to control the money supply \u2013 as it happens, for example, in Quantitative Easing (QE) programs.\nAs reported by MIT Technology Review, Meiklejohn says it would make sense for large commercial banks to process and validate transactions in the RSCoin network. Meiklejohn added that RSCoin\u2019s centralized design would permit a high transaction throughput, unlike Bitcoin. In fact, a recent study shows that, in the current design of Bitcoin Core, there is a fundamental conflict between throughput and decentralization. Incremental improvements could permit a throughput of about 27 transactions per second in the Bitcoin network, but \u201cmore aggressive scaling will, in the longer term, require fundamental protocol redesign.\u201d\n\u201c[RSCoin] provides the control over monetary policy that entities such as central banks expect to retain,\u201d conclude Danezis and Meiklejohn. \u201cBy constructing a blockchain-based approach that makes relatively minimal alterations to the design of successful cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, we have demonstrated that this centralization can be achieved while still maintaining the transparency guarantees that have made (fully) decentralized cryptocurrencies so attractive.\u201d\nRSCoin currently is only a research proposal, but it\u2019s interesting to speculate on whether it could become an official project of the BoE, as previous \u2013 veiled but clear \u2013 statements by the central bank seems to indicate.\nPhoto George Rex / Flickr(CC)", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 14}

This is the first release in a series of projects related to the Internet of Things that the company plans to release in the coming weeks.\nHow Does It Work?\nThanks to the release of its Bitcoin Computer last year, 21 has created a decentralized network of machines that are financially connected to each other via Bitcoin. Ping21 essentially takes advantage of 21\u2019s network of devices to process various requests in exchange for Bitcoin. This first service offered by the network allows web developers to see whether a specific device or server is online or experiencing connectivity issues.\nPing21 also takes advantage of 21\u2019s micropayments marketplace, which means the relatively high fees (at least in this context) associated with on-chain Bitcoin transactions will be avoided.\nWebmasters will also soon be able to pay to ping even more devices once the 21 Bitcoin Computer is no longer a requirement to join the grid-computing network.\nWhy is Ping21 Useful?\nIndividuals who have not built their own websites in the past may not understand the value of this new offering from 21. The ability to ping a website from many different locations around the world allows a webmaster to understand whether there are any potential connectivity issues for their site visitors.\nThere are already companies, such as Pingdom, which allow webmasters to determine how their website\u2019s connectivity is performing in various parts of the world. These companies charge monthly fees to their customers because the idea of pay-per-ping was not practical before the existence of Bitcoin-enabled micropayments.\nWith ping21, webmasters are able to pay for pings as they\u2019re needed, and the decentralized nature of the 21 network of devices allows webmasters to gain access to devices in many more locations than what is offered by current, centralized offerings.\nCreating the Machine Economy\nPing21 is a sneak preview of the machine economy, which 21 is attempting to cultivate. In addition to a currency, 21 also views Bitcoin as, potentially, a new system resource for computers. Bitcoin has essentially enabled the set of incentives necessary for devices to trade data and services on a level that was not possible in the past.\nOf course, if a new marketplace for machine-to-machine payments is developed, it\u2019s important for one machine to be able to verify the authenticity of data sold to it by another machine. When asked about this point, 21 Engineer Andrew DeSantis told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cIf two nodes offering similar services are returning drastically different results, we can perform audits and make the appropriate adjustments to each node\u2019s reputation on the marketplace.\u201d\nWhile ping21 may seem like a simple service to some, 21 is essentially laying the groundwork for many of the most-interesting applications of Bitcoin that have been talked about in the past. This is the sort of structure that could eventually power decentralized versions of many cloud-based computing services.\n21 CEO Balaji S. Srinivasan had the following to say on the release of ping21:\n\n\u201cThe ping service is relatively easy to deploy and understand, but we want to stress that ping21 is just a first example of what can be done with these tools. It\u2019s a proof of concept to show what kinds of services you can offer via decentralized Bitcoin-incentivized grid computing that are qualitatively different from -- and complementary to -- what you can get from centralized cloud computing.\u201d\n\n21 has posted a ping21 tutorial for developers on their website.\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

Companies such as 21 inc and Coinbase rasied $116 million and $75 million, respectively, dwarfing the relative investment into the early days of the Internet.\nMajor companies such as American Express, Deloitte, Goldman Sachs, MasterCard and the New York Stock Exchange have invested millions into Bitcoin technology firms recently. Many banks are also getting on board and investing into blockchain projects, although few are investing in Bitcoin itself.\nTo keep up with the growing scope of the industry, many venture capitalists are also changing their investment strategies. Bitcoin Magazine spoke with the Blockchain Capital team and Brayton Williams, a co-founder of Boost VC, to get an idea of what the current Venture Capital perspective is in the industry.\nThe Blockchain Capital team, which recently raised a new fund totaling $13 million, explained\u00a0to Bitcoin Magazine that the fund is evaluating many different applications of Bitcoin and blockchain technology.\u00a0\u201cWhen we were still Crypto Currency Partners, we were much more focused on the financial applications of bitcoin technology. However, the world of finance, with its corresponding regulation, is incredibly slow moving,\u201d the team said in a statement.\nIn addition, they believe there are already a handful of established players, which leads to fewer niches for new Bitcoin startups.\nFor this reason, Blockchain Capital explained that \u201cas the blockchain ecosystem has evolved, and promising non-financial applications of this tech have emerged, we have increasingly found ourselves inclined towards these applications with a much lower regulatory burden. We have made promising investments in companies that use the blockchain in novel ways\u2026 [and] already have major proof-of-concept trials underway.\u201d\u00a0\nTheir rationale is that if the industry a startup is competing in does not risk being entirely disrupted, the company will have an easier time scaling.\nSpecifically, after the addition of Jeremy Gardner from Augur to their team, they have begun to get serious about Ethereum.\n\u201cSmart contracts are incredibly exciting, and have the potential to disrupt countless industries,\u201d Blockchain Capital said, adding it \u201cwill deploy about half of the fund towards new, early-stage investments. The second half will be geared towards follow-on investments for top companies moving into later stage rounds.\u201d\nBoost VC also recently announced announced in a Medium article, written by Brayton, that it was beginning to expand the scope of its portfolio to include Ethereum startups. The blog post explains that the primary reason that Boost VC was beginning to invest into Ethereum startups was because some of its portfolio companies had begun to use the Ethereum blockchain \u201cbecause of its ease of use and robust toolkit.\u201d\nWilliams said in a statement to Bitcoin Magazine that their fund will now look at Ethereum companies the same way as Bitcoin companies and that they will \u201ccontinue to invest in ~20 [companies] twice a year through our accelerator program.\u201d He adds that Ethereum is still a forward-thinking investment in the VC ecosystem, as \u201cVC\u2019s are looking for traction and right now there are no blockchain companies with significant traction/users.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 16}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nThe Winklevoss twins recently made an appearance at SXSW Interactive 2016, where the early Bitcoin adopters discussed how the industry has changed and matured over the past three to four years. The keys points made by the Winklevi in terms of Bitcoin\u2019s maturation had to do with clearer regulation, better protections for consumers and the increased availability of \u00a0professional-grade exchanges.\nWhen asked about how Bitcoin has grown as a technology and an industry over the past few years, Cameron Winklevoss said, \u201cI think Bitcoin still does what it has done since day one. I think probably the biggest change is really the types of people building inside the system today.\u201d\nBitcoin Companies Are Now Protecting Consumers\nOne of the major signs of maturation in the Bitcoin industry has been the creation of regulated exchanges. During his appearance at SXSW Interactive 2016, Cameron Winklevoss, who co-founded the Bitcoin exchange Gemini with his twin brother, Tyler, stated:\n\n\u201cWith Gemini, we\u2019re a regulated trust company in the state of New York; we\u2019re regulated under banking law, so we operate and have the same controls and procedures that you would expect of any financial institution (like your bank). That didn\u2019t exist in the early days of Bitcoin. Quite frankly, it didn\u2019t exist a year ago . . . It was a Wild West in the early days.\u201d\n\nThe Winklevoss Twins are of the belief that the existence of regulated exchanges will calm some of the fears institutional investors have when it comes to speculation on the Bitcoin price.\u00a0\nCameron Winklevoss noted:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing a lot of the same kind of consumer protections in things that you see in other financial areas that are regulated coming to Bitcoin. What that enables is getting people comfortable buying and selling Bitcoin, especially from both the individuals to the institutions.\u201d\n\nWhether the existence of Gemini has led to increased activity from institutional players is debatable. As of March 12th, Gemini was the 13th largest Bitcoin exchange based on 24-hour volume (according to Bitcoinity.org). Having said that, there are other Bitcoin exchanges aimed at institutional investors in the United States such as Coinbase Exchange and itBit.\nThe Professionals Have Arrived in the Bitcoin Space\nBuilding off of Cameron\u2019s previous comments, Tyler Winklevoss added that the people building companies in the Bitcoin industry today are much more professional than the early adopters of the technology. He noted:\n\n\u201cA lot of the professionals just weren\u2019t in the space [in the early days]. The best entrepreneurs were building companies outside of Bitcoin, and I think a lot of times early adoptions are not the mature actors. So it was kind of like kids in a garage, for lack of a better metaphor.\u201d\n\nThe most obvious example of the \u201ckids in a garage\u201d Tyler was referring to would have to be Mt. Gox, which filed for bankruptcy in early 2014 after losing hundreds of thousands of their customers\u2019 bitcoins.\nTyler Winklevoss added that he and his brother are taking a more legitimate approach to building a Bitcoin exchange:\n\n\u201cWe, entrepreneurs obviously building a company, have kind of the garage mentality, but we\u2019re taking a more legitimate approach to it because we\u2019re dealing with money. We\u2019re not dealing with people\u2019s pictures or even getting them from point A to point B, and if you lose somebody\u2019s money, it\u2019s a really bad thing. It\u2019s very different from losing your text message or your picture. It really hurts your welfare.\u201d\n\nAlthough it\u2019s easy for any kid to build his own Android or iOS app, things can be problematic when a single programmer, who may not be following the best security practices, is essentially controlling millions of dollars worth of other people\u2019s money (as seen in the case of Mt. Gox.)\nBuilding a Bridge to the Legacy Financial System\nOne of the key points that the Winklevoss Twins have routinely made in regard to their own endeavours in the Bitcoin industry is that they\u2019d like to build a bridge between digital currencies and the legacy financial system. Tyler Winklevoss made this point again at SXSW Interactive 2016. He stated:\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s build that bridge to the legacy world. Let\u2019s not become it, but let\u2019s take the safe parts about it and take the new innovation and marry the two.\u201d\n\nThe main point the Winklevoss Twins made during their recent interview at SXSW is that it\u2019s now much easier and safer for anyone to gain exposure to the Bitcoin price as a speculation thanks to platforms such as Gemini. Near the end of their chat with interviewer John Biggs, Tyler Winklevoss stated:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re regulated by the same people who probably regulate your bank, and I think that says a lot.\u201d\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

Ehrsam mentioned some of these industries during the podcast:\n\n\u201cYou have a few select industries, which it sounds like you guys at 1776 are focused on here, which have not been disrupted to date a whole lot, largely because they tend to be more centralized and/or government regulated. Those include finance, healthcare and education. There are others, but those are the big three that I would think about.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s open, permissionless and censorship-resistant nature makes it a potentially powerful tool for regulatory hacking in the area of finance.\nBitcoin Turns Finance Into a Software Problem\nWhen asked for his overall perspective on the importance of Bitcoin, Ehrsam talked about how the blockchain turns finance into nothing more than a software problem. As opposed to the highly regulated and slow-to-adapt traditional financial system, creating a financial application on top of Bitcoin requires nothing more than the ability to write some code.\u00a0\nThe Coinbase co-founder then talked about the positive effects on society found when real-world problems become software problems:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all seen what happens when a problem becomes a software problem; the level of innovation and the rate at which iteration can occur just goes through the roof. As a result, you get way more great ideas being built, and the consumer usually ends up winning, too, because the services are better and the fees go down.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the competition associated with an open, somewhat-lawless system creates better situations for entrepreneurs and consumers. As Ehrsam put it, \u201cSaid another way, [software problems] are subject to real market forces rather than being closed. It\u2019s open, just like what we\u2019ve seen with the Internet.\u201d\nThe Frustrations Related to Old, Closed Financial Systems\nIn order to describe the benefits of Bitcoin\u2019s openness, Burfield covered the issues related to the traditional financial system. He noted:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think most people can actually articulate just how frustrating interacting with financial services on a day-to-day basis actually \u2012 like, there\u2019s so many dumb things that you encounter over and over again.\u201d\n\nBurfield then explained that the problems associated with traditional financial services companies have not been as obvious in the past due to the lack of an open system to be compared against:\n\n\u201cWe just, sort of, accept that as part of the background noise of leading our daily lives, and until you flip it and start to get innovators attacking the problem without all of the barriers a closed system encounters, I don\u2019t think you can even start to show people where things should be at.\u201d\n\nBurfield went on to contrast Bitcoin with the financial system in Africa. While a money transfer between two parties in different African nations routinely costs more than 10 percent of the transaction\u2019s value, and central bankers are sometimes not resistant to the temptation to print more money, Bitcoin has extremely low costs as a payment settlement network and has a monetary policy that is essentially controlled by the users of the digital currency.\nIs Coinbase Involved with Regulatory Hacking?\nWhen asked for Coinbase\u2019s approach to regulatory hacking, Ehrsam was quick to note that the concept is difficult to apply to the financial services industry today, especially in the United States. He explained:\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s more difficult for people in financial services, generally speaking, than other industries, like the taxi industry for example, to do what you would think of as regulatory hacking. The reality is that financial services are highly regulated by many, many different parties, whereas you might just have one in other industries. Also, just given the recent past in financial services, it tends to be an area of extreme focus \u2012 maybe more so than any other point of history in the United States.\u201d\n\nEhrsam then stated that Coinbase\u2019s approach to regulators has been rather friendly:\n\n\u201cOur approach, as a result, has actually been quite the opposite; it\u2019s to proactively go to regulators early on and say, \u2018Hey. Here we are. We\u2019re good guys. You can know us. If you have questions, please come to us.\u2019\u201d\n\nCoinbase has taken a lot of flack in the Bitcoin community due to its compliance with regulations, but the reality is that it would be shut down rather quickly if it didn\u2019t follow the law. Recently, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong published a Medium post where he pointed out that the company is an exchange and not a wallet provider. In the past, ShapeShift CEO and longtime Bitcoin entrepreneur Erik Voorhees has defended Coinbase against various attacks from the community.\nBitcoin Won\u2019t Create a Libertarian Utopia\nAlthough Evan Burfield sees the need for more regulatory hackers in the world, he does not feel that Bitcoin is going to create some sort of libertarian utopia. He explained:\n\n\u201cThe idea that Bitcoin is going to be this completely libertarian utopia where there\u2019s zero regulation and complete anonymity is probably not real practical when you look at stuff like this.\u201d\n\nEhrsam mostly agreed with Burfield\u2019s stance. He added:\n\n\u201cThe reality is maybe somewhere in between where businesses that operate on the Internet are subject to all the same laws and regulations, but the reality is that we now have a more open environment, which you could argue is libertarian in some ways. But the net result, I agree, is not complete libertarian utopia. It\u2019s more about the services that this brings that fundamentally couldn\u2019t have existed before.\u201d\n\nThere has always been perceived tension between the early adopters of Bitcoin and the people who want to take the technology to the general public. It\u2019s important to remember that, while the businesses built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain can be regulated, the base protocol is much harder for regulators to get their hands around.\nThe aspects of Bitcoin that do bring more libertarian, or even anarchistic, ideals into the real world are usually found in software rather than startups. A company can be targeted and shut down, but individuals are free to run open-source code, such as JoinMarket or Dark Wallet, on their own computers. Bitcoin is far from anonymous right now, but it will be interesting to see what happens if more privacy-enhancing features are added to the protocol.\n\u00a0\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

ProtonMail is also launching its free iOS and Android mobile applications globally in the Apple App store and Google Play store.\nProtonMail \u00a0features end-to-end encryption, which makes it practically impossible for governments, or even ProtonMail itself, to gain access to user messages, ensuring the highest level of security and privacy. The service encrypts and decrypts all data on-the-fly on the client side, which means that emails between ProtonMail users are never stored as plaintext, and therefore the government can\u2019t force their release.\n\u201cStrong encryption and privacy are a social and economic necessity. Not only does this technology protect activists and dissidents, it is also key to securing the world\u2019s digital infrastructure,\u201d says ProtonMail co-founder Andy Yen. \u201cThis is why, all things considered, strong encryption is absolutely necessary for the greater good.\u201d\nThe development of ProtonMail started in 2014 at CERN \u2012 just like the development of the Web itself \u2012 in response to growing concerns about governments spying on peaceful citizens\u2019 email.\u00a0\n\u201cI am very concerned about the privacy issue, and I was wondering what I could do about it,\u201d Yen posted to a CERN Facebook group. ProtonMail raised its first $550,000 with crowdfunding, followed by a $2 million seed round from Charles River Ventures and Fongit.\u00a0\nToday, ProtonMail is one of the fastest-growing companies in Switzerland with three offices globally, and was ranked last year by Business Insider as the hottest startup in Switzerland.\nThe decision to open up ProtonMail is motivated by an increasing trend toward more and more surveillance around the world and growing efforts to undermine online privacy.\u00a0\n\u201cWe understand that governments have concerns when it comes to terrorism and encryption, but undermining our collective security by weakening cryptography is the wrong approach,\u201d notes the announcement.\n\u201cThe best way to ensure that encryption and privacy rights are not encroached upon is to get the tools into the hands of the public as soon as possible and widely distributing them,\u201d added Yen. \u201cThis way, we put the choice in the hands of the consumer, and not government regulators. The past decade has been marked by a massive erosion of privacy and we\u2019re working to reverse this trend. Encrypted communications is the future and ProtonMail is committed to making online privacy a reality again for all Internet users.\u201d\nAnyone can open a ProtonMail account without releasing personal information. Interestingly, the sign-up procedure \u2012 like ProtonMail itself \u2012 works well over Tor.\u00a0\n\u201cCreating your free secure email account takes less than 2 minutes in most cases,\u201d notes the ProtonMail signup page. The free service includes 500 megabytes of storage, and paid services have been launched recently. The cheapest premium plan, at $5 per month ($4 per month if paid annually), includes 5 gigabytes of storage and a custom domain. Current payment options are credit cards, PayPal and Bitcoin.\nThe Bitcoin payment option complements the anonymity of the signup process and the possibility to sign up and use ProtonMail over Tor. Taken together, these features mean that anonymous users can have premium ProtonMail accounts.\nProtonMail is a Swiss company with servers located in secure data centers in Switzerland, and is protected by privacy-friendly Swiss laws. In 2015, Bitcoin company Xapo relocated its corporate headquarters to Zurich to take advantage of the same privacy-friendly laws. Xapo\u2019s primary deep cold storage vault was already located in Switzerland.\nThis is one of many parallels between ProtonMail and Bitcoin. ProtonMail wants to put privacy back into the Internet, which is increasingly controlled by governments and corporations as shown by the current dispute between Apple and the FBI over encrypted communications.\u00a0\nBitcoin, which in theory permits private payments on the Internet, is also increasingly controlled by governments and corporations in ways that can void privacy. However, there are initiatives such as Zcash that promise to put private payments back into the Internet.\n\"ProtonMail and Bitcoin actually have a long history together,\u201d Yen told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cBack in 2014 when PayPal instituted a payment block against us, we relied on BTC donations to keep the service running.\"\n\"We view the Apple case as very troubling, and unfortunately, Apple is likely to lose this one in the court of opinion since the FBI picked their case very carefully,\u201d added Yen. \u201cHowever, Apple is not Lavabit [an encrypted webmail service, used by Edward Snowden, which was shut down by the US government], and if the world's largest tech company is standing on the side of privacy, the entire movement just gained a very powerful ally.\"\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 18}

To encrypt and store digital rights on the Bitcoin blockchain, most of these blockchain startups have either encoded an ID into the Bitcoin blockchain using OP_RETURN or CoinSpark to reference centrally hosted data or used a custom-built blockchain to attach metadata directly to transactions.\nBut there are several challenges in using these two techniques in encoding metadata onto the Bitcoin blockchain.\u00a0\nFor example, the maximum data storage per transaction allowed by the Bitcoin protocol\u2019s built-in OP_RETURN code is 40 bytes. This restricted storage makes it difficult to store long strings of metadata onto the Bitcoin blockchain. Thus, using OP_RETURN to encrypt metadata onto the Bitcoin blockchain becomes extremely inefficient and is discouraged by core developers which think that it contributes to \u201cblockchain bloat.\u201d\nThe issue with the second technique of building a custom blockchain is security. Newly established blockchain networks with a lack of miners and hash power could be vulnerable to 51 percent attacks. The problem intensifies if the data and the blockchain becomes large and there is not enough hash power to secure the protected information.\nPete Dushenski explains, \u201cAs shorter walls are easier to attack, the city has grown at the expense of security. To bring this into relevant (Bitcoin) terms, the size of the city is the Blockchain and the height of its walls is the network\u2019s hashrate. As such, the larger the Blockchain, the more hashpower is required to maintain the same level of security.\u201d\nInstead of solely relying on the Bitcoin blockchain\u2019s built-in features to store metadata, Mine Labs has introduced a new method of validating data without storing large sums of information onto the Bitcoin blockchain itself. Mine Labs\u2019 protocol, called Mediachain, capitalizes on the limitations of existing startups by using the InterPlanetary File System to store the actual data, but publishing the data onto the Bitcoin blockchain to authenticate the information using using time stamps. This allows digital content providers, artists and freelancers to encrypt rights to their digital content by making images and other information interoperable and discoverable in a hybrid decentralized system.\n\u201cMediachain is a collaborative federated media metadata protocol that allows parties to make statements about creative works,\u201d explains Denis Nazarov of Mine Labs. \u201cThe metadata statements are cryptographically signed by the contributor, timestamped in the Bitcoin blockchain, and stored in IPFS. The statements can then be looked up via perceptual search using an instance of the media itself.\u201d\nOne of the core technologies behind Mediachain, the InterPlanetary File System is a new hypermedia distribution protocol developed by the IPFS community and many contributors from the open source community to enable the creation of completely distributed applications. The concept of IPFS is actually similar to the Web in terms of providing a high throughput block storage model with content-specific cryptographic hyperlinks. The unique advantage of using the IPFS as a foundation of an application is that the IPFS provides cryptographic proof or hash to every set of data stored in the system.\n\u201cIPFS, billed as \u201ca new hypermedia distribution protocol,\u201d is a stack incorporating a lot of the best distributed systems ideas of the past few years (DHTs, Merkle DAGs, BitTorrent swarms, self-certifying file systems) to deliver a global, uniformly addressable namespace that anyone can participate in. A recently landed new object format patterned after JSON-LD allows us to store richly structured and interlinked data within this system,\u201d explained Arkadiy Kukarkin of Mine Labs.\nBecause the data encoded into the IPFS system is accompanied by a unique cryptographic hash of its digital content, the actual links to the content cannot be changed or altered. The Mediachain publishes the cryptographic hash of the content onto the Bitcoin blockchain, providing irrefutable and unalterable data that can be used to verify and authenticate digital content.\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 21}

Gox fiasco, Japan recognized Bitcoin\u2019s potential two years ago, and asked members within the Bitcoin and blockchain industry to form a self-regulatory authority called the Japan Authority of Digital Assets (JADA).\u00a0\nJADA is supported by LDP\u2019s IT committee, and is currently in discussion with Japanese government offices. There is no specific governmental office that regulates JADA, which currently has four members: bitFlyer, Orb, Kraken and Coincheck, and several supporting members such as Deloitte.\u00a0\nJADA meets with FSA (a Japanese government organization and ntegrated financial regulator responsible for overseeing banking, securities and exchange and insurance sectors) and other governmental bodies (such as the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Bank of Japan) once a month, and is in constant discussion with the National Tax Authority (NTA), police agency and other governmental offices.\nBitcoin Magazine talked with JADA\u2019s legal counsel So Saito, who said, \u201cOur first activity was to establish self-regulatory rules regarding AML [anti-money laundering], security protection and consumer protection. The recent topic we\u2019ve been discussing is a new law.\u00a0\n\u201cFSA asked us about the current situation in the industry, current issues and desired regulation,\u201d he said. \u201cSome media outlets wrote that Bitcoin would be regarded as currency. I, however, do not think that Japan would regard Bitcoin as currency.\u201d\nHe added:\u00a0\n\n\u201cI have heard that FSA was to submit new regulation to the lower house on March 4. I have not yet got the actual article. However, another media outlet said that cryptocurrency will be defined as \u2018Property value, which can be used when a person purchases goods, etc. from a non-specific person and can be electronically transferred.\u2019 I believe that this definition is more close to the actual definition of the new regulation.\u201d\n\nAs to the future, Saito said, \u201cI welcome new Bitcoin [currency] regulation. Traditional financial institutions are generally hesitant to deal with Bitcoin because it\u2019s currently non-regulated. I expect more traditional companies will advance to the [regulated] Bitcoin world.\n\u201cTraditional financial institutions (including Japanese megabanks) are eager to study blockchain. \u00a0There are many announcements stating that Japanese companies have started demonstration experiments with blockchain technology. We have discussed new regulations with FSA.\"\nSaito said that he was unable to disclose further details of these discussions at this time, but Bitcoin Magazine will follow developments.\nSelf-regulatory bodies such as JADA may provide insight for governments around the world looking at approaches to regulating Bitcoin and blockchain technology.\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 18}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nOne of the main issues that has held back the adoption of Bitcoin as a network for value transfer on the Internet is that it\u2019s too difficult for the average person to figure out how to use it. With long strings of characters for Bitcoin addresses and volatility risk associated with holding the digital currency (among other issues), the lack of adoption among the general public should come as no surprise.\nTo combat the poor user experience associated with Bitcoin, entrepreneurs and venture capitalists now view Bitcoin as the plumbing that can power higher-level applications. In other words, startups are now hiding the fact that they\u2019re using Bitcoin from their users (or rather just not mentioning the digital value transfer system at all.)\nDuring the Bitcoin talk at SXSW Interactive 2016, Freemit CEO John Biggs discussed the idea of hiding Bitcoin from the consumer with the Winklevoss twins, who co-founded the Bitcoin exchange Gemini. Biggs made his view on this topic clear during the recent event when he stated, \u201cOur mission is not to talk about Bitcoin at all.\u201d\nHiding the Technicals of Bitcoin\nThe Winklevoss twins agreed with Biggs\u2019 overall sentiment. Tyler Winklevoss made a comparison between Bitcoin addresses and IP addresses to make his point. He stated:\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t see a Bitcoin address \u2012 just like when you go to Google and you type in \u2018google.com\u2019, you don\u2019t see the IP address. I think that Bitcoin needs to be under the hood, it\u2019s not user-friendly enough in a command line type format.\u201d\n\nThe Winklevoss twins have attempted to make Bitcoin as easy to use as possible on Gemini. Tyler noted, \u201cIf you sign up for Gemini, it\u2019s just as easy as using any other website.\u201d\nEven for Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals on the Gemini platform, the Winklevoss twins have attempted to make the process as intuitive and simple as can be. Tyler talked about how their exchange uses QR codes to remove Bitcoin addresses from the equation whenever possible. He added, \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as taking a picture with your iPhone.\u201d\nUsing Bitcoin in 2016 is Similar to Using Internet in 1995\nTyler Winklevoss made analogies to the early days of the Internet when he talked about the difficulties associated with Bitcoin usage right now. For this new technology to gain mainstream users, the Winklevoss Twins believe the entrepreneurs and innovators in the space need to remove the technical complexities from the high-level applications. Tyler Winklevoss said, \u201cIt can\u2019t feel like surfing the web in 1995.\u201d\nIn terms of the problems with getting people to use Bitcoin right now, Tyler Winklevoss added, \u201cEntrepreneurs like ourselves and [John Biggs] \u2012 we\u2019re going to change that, and we are changing that.\u201d\nWhich Startups Should Be Hiding Bitcoin?\nOne of the possible reasons Bitcoin may not be completely user-friendly at this point is that most startups have been building the basic infrastructure required to make the system function. In reality, there\u2019s no point in hiding Bitcoin from the end user when you\u2019re building exchanges and wallets.\nNow that the basic groundwork for the use of Bitcoin has been completed, startups can focus on less technically-inclined users. Cameron Winklevoss explained, \u201cI think there\u2019s going to be a lot of companies that are probably utilizing Bitcoin in their transactions, but the end user is going to be none the wiser for it.\u201d\nIn the past, Blockchain Capital Managing Partner Brock Pierce has also discussed the idea of hiding Bitcoin from consumers. Abra is a Blockchain Capital portfolio company that won Launch Festival 2015 without mentioning Bitcoin during its presentation.\nCameron Winklevoss also touched on the notion of appcoins, which some believe could be used to decentralize other applications in a manner similar to the way Bitcoin has decentralized value transfer on the Internet. The Gemini co-founder stated:\n\n\u201cCloud computing can be decentralized. Cloud storage can be decentralized. Money has been decentralized. Social networks can be decentralized. Any sort of cloud-based service on the Internet could have a token or an appcoin and be decentralized. I\u2019m willing to bet more often than not that\u2019s the future we\u2019re looking at.\u201d\n\nCameron Winklevoss\u2019s comments appear to be a reference to various alternative tokens, such as Storjcoin x and Ether, which are intended to power the decentralized storage and computing applications of the future. Having said that, there are plenty of people in the Bitcoin community who aren\u2019t convinced that the economics of appcoins make much sense at all.\nThe startups that use Bitcoin without ranting and raving about it should be watching closely over the next few years. In a world where many Facebook users don\u2019t realize that they\u2019re also using the Internet, this strategy could have a positive impact on bringing Bitcoin to the general public.\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

The integration of Bitcoin relieves e-commerce platforms from storing sensitive financial data on their local servers, reducing the risk of a data breach and leak of personal user information. By providing Bitcoin as one of its main payment methods, Bidorbuy aims to lead the growth of the e-commerce industry in Kenya and South Africa.\nBidorbuy has more than 700,000 items listed on its online marketplace and generates more than 30 million page views per month. It is the largest corporation in the South African and Kenyan e-commerce industry by market share and the size of userbase.\u00a0\nThe e-commerce market of Kenya is growing at a rapid pace. According to the Communications Authority of Kenya, the data/Internet market in the country has grown exponentially since 2014, due to the increase in smartphone adoption rate and speed of bandwidth Internet connection across Africa.\n\u201cAll sub-categories of data/Internet service demonstrated growth apart from the terrestrial wireless service which recorded a drop in the number of subscriptions during the quarter. This was as a result of the on-going migration of wireless subscribers to fiber network by some of the major data/Internet providers. Emergence of new markets such as e-Commerce will present a prime opportunity for the market to make a turnaround and begin to record growth as it provides physical delivery services for online transactions,\u201d said the\u00a0Communications Authority of Kenya.\nThe country\u2019s e-commerce platforms, including the popular OLX online marketplace, have experienced a huge growth momentum in Africa. OLX Kenya manager Peter Ndiang\u2019ui says the establishment of stable Internet connections and the emergence of affordable smartphones led the African e-commerce industries to achieve significant milestones over the past year, especially daily purchase volumes, market share over traditional markets such as the retail industry and the number of newly registered members on online marketplaces.\n\u201cAll those services [available on e-commerce platforms] are having a huge growth momentum in Africa and specifically in Kenya. The biggest driver is the access to smartphones. Smartphones have become cheaper, and Internet access has spread with broadband spreading much more wider,\u201d said\u00a0OLX Kenya Manager Peter Ndiang\u2019ui.\nVisa South Africa General Manager Jabu Basopo explains that an increasing number of e-commerce platform users are starting to purchase more airline tickets and clothes online to eliminate the inconvenience of visiting retail shops or travel agencies at traffic heavy hours.\n\u201cIf we look at the trends, the top three areas that are growing are electronics, fashion and airlines. However, each market differs. In some markets you\u2019d see probably the airlines being number 1 [growing area],\u201d said Visa South Africa General Manager Jabu Basopo.\nDespite the rapidly growing clientele of many e-commerce platforms, one major issue with Kenya and other African countries\u2019 online marketplaces that is restricting the potential expansion of the e-commerce industry throughout Africa is poor financial infrastructure and vulnerability of credit card payments.\u00a0\nKenya\u2019s leading online electronics marketplace Kilimall marketing manager Charles Mungai says a lot of users of e-commerce platforms have had their sensitive financial information and credit card data leaked over the past few years. Since e-commerce platforms manage centralized local servers or databases of sensitive user data and financial information, users\u2019 credit card data are prone to hacking attacks and data breaches. If a hacker or a group of hackers gain access to an e-commerce platform\u2019s servers, users\u2019 financial data will inevitably become leaked.\n\u201cA lot of people have got themselves into very nasty situations because of issues with credit cards, fraud and financial insecurity. For example, you give credit card information on a platform that was not very secure and somebody takes that information,\u201d said Charles Mungai, Marketing Manager of Kilimall.\nThe increase in financial fraud and consumer insecurity associated with credit cards and traditional means of payment have led a substantial part of Kenya\u2019s population to refrain from using online payment tools in purchasing goods online. By incorporating Bitcoin into its online platform, Bidorbuy hopes to initiate a trend back toward e-commerce.\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 22}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe r/Bitcoin subreddit has increasingly become a major source of news and information for anyone interested in Bitcoin. Established in 2010 and counting more than 170,000 subscribed accounts today, it is the oldest and biggest Bitcoin-related page on Reddit, and perhaps even the most influential Bitcoin corner on the Internet.\nBut since last summer, r/Bitcoin has been under increased scrutiny. In a controversial move, the subreddit\u2019s moderators banned the promotion of software clients programmed to break with consensus. While many considered this a form of censorship, the moderators maintain that promotion of these clients is a risk to Bitcoin as they could split the network, and therefore it doesn\u2019t belong on the subreddit.\nMoreover, the subreddit moderators are convinced their policy is needed to limit manipulation of popular sentiment, which they suspect is an ongoing practice on the webpage.\nThe pseudonymous \u201cBashCo\u201d is one of r/Bitcoin's moderators. To test this hypothesis, he did a multi-week data-analysis on the subreddit. Now, BashCo believes the results suggest what he had long suspected: the subreddit has fallen victim to extensive - and possibly automated - vote manipulation.\nBashCo, who preferred to remain pseudonymous, shared his results with Bitcoin Magazine.\nThe Reliability\nCollecting reliable data on Reddit vote manipulation is not as easy as it may sound \u2013 not even for subreddit moderators.\nThat's in part because Reddit itself seeks to tackle vote manipulation in several ways \u2013 but it\u2019s unclear exactly how. While these measures (presumably) make it harder to cheat the system, and might help the sitewide Reddit administrators catch cheaters, it actually makes structural analysis for everyone else significantly more difficult.\n\u201cI don't know the full extent of Reddit's methods to obscure vote scores,\u201d BashCo explained. \u201cThe Reddit administrators keep these mechanisms closely guarded, and it's likely an evolving system. That said, I do suspect that some vote cheating slips past them, just like how spam filters don't catch all spam. We've seen\u00a0Sybil attacks on the Bitcoin network, and it's not unreasonable to assume that the same sort of thing occurs on social media. Bitcoin communities are unique targets for vote cheating due to potential financial incentives behind influencing public opinion.\u201d\nOne method Reddit employs to battle manipulation \u2013 \u201cvote fuzzing\u201d \u2013 slightly randomizes all vote scores. This makes it difficult for outsiders to keep track of all votes on a specific comment. However, visual analysis (in other words: hitting refresh after a new comment to see if the score changed) suggests vote fuzzing occurs only after a comment has received a first real vote.\nSo BashCo wrote a basic script that keeps track of the very first vote on any comment received; the vote that shouldn't be influenced by vote fuzzing. More specifically, BashCo's script registers how fast a comment receives its first vote, and whether that is an upvote or a downvote.\nBashCo ran his script on r/Bitcoin as well as several other popular subreddits for several weeks. And he claims to have found interesting trends.\u00a0\nFor one, there was a clear difference in the speed of voting on the Bitcoin subreddit, compared to all other subreddits he tested. According to BashCo, comments on typical subreddits took several minutes on average to receive an initial vote, while on r/Bitcoin a high number of votes were cast within the first minute after appearing online, and often even faster.\n\nBashCo believes the abnormal speed of voting suggests (though, doesn't conclusively prove) something out of the ordinary is happening on r/Bitcoin.\nNote: Unfortunately BashCo has not (yet) graphed the timing on votes on other subreddits. He is currently re-doing this part of his analysis, and this article will be updated once this data is available.\nThe Data\nAssuming the unusual speed of the initial votes indeed reveal some sort of manipulation might be going on, it\u2019s interesting to see how these quick votes are cast.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, BashCo's data suggests they are politically motivated.\nThe moderator's analysis shows a very clear divide between users in favor of a fast block size limit increase hard fork, and those that are more conservative. Specifically, several of the most vocal supporters of a such a hard fork receive upvotes almost instantaneously, while dozens of opponents receive quick downvotes.\n\nIf there is indeed any vote manipulation going on, BashCo's data suggests it's done to promote a hard fork block size limit increase. (But note that this manipulation might in that case be done by completely different users than those receiving the votes; they are not necessarily to blame for anything.)\nCommenting on the results, BashCo said:\n\u201cThe evident divide is certainly the most alarming aspect. I think if this wasn't politically motivated, then there wouldn't be such a clear delineation between each political faction. Instead, we would see more users from each faction receiving a mixed number of votes. Dozens of 'pro-consensus' users receiving instantaneous downvotes across hundreds of comments indicate that these are not organic voting patterns.\u201d\nThe Conclusion\nOf course, the available data is limited, and not necessarily conclusive. As always with this type of analysis, it's possible there are alternative explanations for the trends, and even coincidence cannot be completely ruled out.\nBut at the same time, the little available data might very well be the tip of the iceberg. Since the trend as shown by BashCo is clear, even with this little available data, perhaps a much bigger wave of manipulation is taking place on the subreddit \u2013 much of which remains undetectable.\nBashCo himself, however, refrained from drawing hard conclusions.\n\u201cThe data suggests that something is amiss regarding vote patterns. It does not outright prove vote manipulation is occurring, and we need to defer to Reddit's sitewide administrators for that, since they have a more complete picture. To date, Reddit administrators did confirm that multiple accounts are targeting users listed in the published data. This is certainly a piece of the puzzle, but it's a puzzle we can't solve to our satisfaction,\u201d BashCo said.\nFurthermore, even assuming manipulation, the r/Bitcoin moderator pointed out there is no way of knowing who\u2019s behind it.\n\u201cThere's many flavors of disruptive actors, and not all of them are malicious against the Bitcoin project,\u201d BashCo said. \u201cPeople have vastly different expectations for the project's future. People tend to become disruptive when their expectations aren't being met, regardless of how realistic their expectations were to begin with. They could be demanding something that's ultimately harmful to Bitcoin, but they still believe they have good intentions. The only way I know to correct this is for people to be willing to learn more about these complex issues from people with more realistic expectations.\u201d\nThe Moderation\nMoving forward, BashCo indicated that combating manipulation will remain top priority for the r/Bitcoin moderation team, though he believes it's an uphill battle. In potentially anonymous environments like Reddit, it's near-impossible to counter all attempts at manipulation, he thinks.\nBashCo:\n\u201cReddit is intended to be driven by user participation. Communities are expected to curate content via upvotes and downvotes. But some people place more trust in the voting system than I believe is warranted. While I'm confident Reddit is doing its best to combat manipulation, I believe it\u2019s not at all uncommon. When we combine proprietary anti-vote cheating measures with potential Sybil attacks, it's impossible to say that vote scores mean anything without having much deeper insight.\u201d\nAnd perhaps unsurprisingly, BashCo and the other r/Bitcoin moderators have no plans to radically change the current moderation policy \u2013 though they have eased their guard a bit recently.\n\u201cIncreased moderation is intended to prevent disruptive actors from inciting drama intended to take the focus away from Bitcoin,\u201d BashCo explained. \u201cNon-consensus clients like Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited are discussed frequently, and we encourage users to promote their favorite BIPs. But promoting non-consensus clients on r/Bitcoin is still off-limits.\u201d\u00a0\nBitcoin Magazine has not been able to verify BashCo's data, but he did make his script\u00a0publicly available. Since completion of this article, BashCo also shared his findings on\u00a0r/Bitcoin.", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 22}

The smart contracts were then distributed to the nine participant nodes that had the ability to execute traditional post-trade processing settlements such as trade valuation, compression, verification and reporting.\u00a0\n\u201cIn successfully completing a proof of technology test, ICAP has demonstrated one of the first real world applications of distributed ledger technology that has the ability to significantly transform the post trade landscape,\u201d announced the ICAP PTRI division\u2019s CEO Jenny Knott.\u00a0\n\u201cRealizing the value of ICAP\u2019s unique portfolio of PTRI businesses and investee companies, we have combined our expertise, networks and technology with Axoni\u2019s distributed ledger technology to push the boundaries of post trade innovation,\u201d she continued.\nThe pilot test of the proof-of-technology protocol demonstrated its potential in optimizing many conventional services in the finance sector. \u00a0The ICAP PTRI division outlined that its technology has the potential to execute the following services:\n\nProvide a common golden source of user transaction and reference data cross asset;\nEnrich and enhance the accuracy and timeliness of data by users and attach further information;\nContinuously update copies of the data to be stored locally on users\u2019 servers;\nSecurely code messages to be viewed only by permissioned participants;\nReduce operational risk and improve reconciliation and operations processes\nRealize multiple back office and technology cost savings.\n\nMarking the successful test of its proof-of-technology as a starting point, ICAP aims to use and distribute its proof-of-technology to maximize its potential in the traditional finance sector. In the next few months, the PTRI division will collaborate with the participants from the pilot test and assess the technology\u2019s efficiency in supporting disparate financial systems. ICAP will also conduct research to evaluate the regulatory side of using a permissioned blockchain to enhance post-trade processing settlements.\nAxoni, the company behind the proof-of-technology protocol of ICAP, is one of the financial technology startups funded by Euclid Opportunities, an early stage funding program of ICAP. Throughout 2016, ICAP\u2019s PTRI division will continue to collaborate with Axoni to revolutionize post-trade processing with blockchain-based products and services.\n\u201cPartnering with ICAP was an easy choice,\u201d said Greg Schvey, CEO of Axoni. \u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of demand for distributed ledger projects. ICAP\u2019s thoughtful consideration of where this technology can be most valuable, its ambitious deployment objectives, and market-leading client reach offer a high probability of success when combined with Axoni\u2019s advanced blockchain infrastructure.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 23}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nTo many people in the Bitcoin community, altcoins are considered nothing more than scams. Part of the reason is that altcoin developers and promoters are often found telling people to purchase an altcoin for their own financial benefit; however, this is not the case for Monero developer Riccardo Spagni.\nSpagni holds a relatively pragmatic view on altcoins. The Monero developer has told individuals with limited funds to not buy the altcoin. In fact, he has stated, \u201cThe most likely scenario is that Monero fails entirely.\u201d\nTo many, Spagni\u2019s unique take on the altcoin market, especially as a developer in the space, is quite refreshing. In a recent interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Spagni expanded on his views related to Monero and altcoins in general.\nThe Majority of Altcoins Are Outright Scams\nMany people refer to altcoins as casinos and testnets. When asked for his opinion on this description of the altcoin market, Spagni said:\n\n\u201cThe majority are outright scams. There's no mincing words with this, and I think it's absolutely disgusting. From obvious premined or instamined scams, to the more subtle mining scams that attempt to hide the premine from block explorers, there are a lot of scams meant to outrightly enrich the creators.\n\u201cIdentifying scams is made doubly difficult because of the existence of professional, highly motivated groups that are behind them, who often co-opt innocent developers who think they're genuinely building something unique.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the scams in the altcoin market, Spagni also sees Bitcoin clones, \u201ccorporate coins\u201d (which are altcoins that have raised funds from investors), and a small number of coins that have something unique to offer. When it comes to those altcoins offering something useful or unique, Spagni claimed, \u201cTo fall into that last category is really hard. I'm not even sure Monero falls into it, although I do hope that it can get there.\u201d\nNo Altcoins Are Currently Useful\nWhen asked which altcoins he thinks have features that are useful today, Spagni simply replied, \u201cNone of them.\u201d\nIn his view, the general lack of interest in altcoins and the security issues related to low-hashrate networks are the two main issues with any altcoin right now. Spagni explained:\n\n\u201cSeriously -- any of the altcoins with an actual useful feature (like Monero, of course) are plagued by a general lack of interest, and a basically insecure hashing network. A sustained attack against Monero's proof-of-work network would be expensive, but not expensive enough to stop a motivated attacker. Similarly, with only several hundred high capacity nodes scattered around the world, the cost of an isolation attack against end-user nodes is much lower than with Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nSpagni clarified that Monero or another altcoin could become secure in the future, but he also pointed out that anyone interested in using Monero should be aware of the risks associated with using it as a store of value.\n\u201cSure, an attacker against the PoW network can't magically steal their Monero, but they could disruptively attack them when they need to spend those funds,\u201d he said.\nWhat Is the Point of Monero?\nSo if most altcoins are useless, then what\u2019s the point of developing Monero? Spagni offered three reasons for Monero\u2019s existence:\n\n\u201cMonero is a place to experiment with things that Bitcoin simply can't experiment with right now. Stuff like our fixed minimum block reward to retain long-term mining incentives, or our so-called egalitarian PoW algorithm that closes the performance gap between CPUs, GPUs, and ASICs, to the point where ASICs may never be financially viable, or at least will not be performant enough to justify a complete abandonment of GPU mining.\u201d\n\u201cMonero is an independent fallback for Bitcoin that is created in much the same spirit as Bitcoin: an anonymous creator that disappeared after the community took it over, pure PoW with no crazy nonsense like overly complex PoS schemes, an alternate EC curve to Bitcoin's secp256k1, and specific differences (like the PoW and the minimum block reward) that make Monero more like \u2018A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\u2019 than anything else. Let me clarify that I am a huge believer in Bitcoin, and I'm not implying at all that Bitcoin will ever fail, but it's comforting to know that in the event of a major, massively disruptive break in Bitcoin there is something else out there.\u201d\n\u201cMonero is a truly fungible, truly private cryptocurrency, that is constantly trying to build on and improve its privacy. The way we view it is simple: one day, somewhere along the line, Monero's privacy is going to mean life or death for someone. They will be in a highly adversarial environment where an attacker's ability to track their Monero transactions means their death. It would be incredibly, incredibly irresponsible and reckless of us to treat our work on Monero's privacy as anything less critical than that, regardless of who our end users are. I do not want to be responsible for someone's death, and neither do any of the Monero contributors or the members of the Monero Research Lab or my fellow members of the Monero Core Team.\u201d\n\nAlthough ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees and Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd have hinted that privacy-focused altcoins may be useful as appcoins for mixing Bitcoin transactions in the past, Spagni does not see things that way.\n\u201cAny rails in and out of Bitcoin are for convenience only,\u201d he said. \u201cThey're a potential privacy leak, no matter whether you're offloading the counterparty risk to someone like ShapeShift or xmr.to, or you're using decentralized rails that will exist in the future. Monero's privacy features are built with the view that you will stay within the system as much as possible to ensure the greatest level of privacy possible.\u201d\nPrivacy in Bitcoin\nIn terms of privacy and fungibility in Bitcoin, Spagni did have some positive things to say about CoinJoin. He pointed out JoinMarket as a particularly fantastic project, but he added:\n\n\u201cThe downside to anything like JoinMarket is that it can't make Bitcoin fungible -- no privacy measures can, unless in the protocol and mandatory for every transaction. But the game theoretic dynamics that come into play with something like this are hard to predict and model -- maybe the concept of \u2018taint\u2019 will be significantly harder to track if JoinMarket and similar systems become commonplace, and then Bitcoin will be \u2018fungible enough,\u2019 until it isn't.\u201d\n\nBlockstream\u2019s Andrew Poelstra recently talked about how Confidential Transactions can improve the effectiveness of CoinJoin at the 2016 MIT Bitcoin Expo, but it\u2019s unclear if or when these two features will be implemented at the protocol level.\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

The Bitcoin network has purposefully omitted Turing completeness to allow the economic incentives the network has been able to create, and for minimizing the security risks that come with self-executable programs.\u00a0\nBut a new smart contracts project by\u00a0RSK Labs called\u00a0Rootstock aims to bring smart contracts to the Bitcoin blockchain while being a Turing Complete platform. In a\u00a0blog post on\u00a0Medium the company said that Rootstock will be similar to the Ethereum project but will use the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\u201cEssentially Rootstock aims to be what Ethereum is, a decentralized, Turing-complete smart contract platform. However, Rootstock aims to utilize the Bitcoin ecosystem rather than creating a new one from scratch. The way this will be accomplished is via the still not fully implemented sidechains technology,\u201d the blog post reads.\nAccording to the company, Rootstock (RSK) will be a sidechain that allows interoperability between both blockchains. \u00a0Developers of RSK believe that the interoperability will keep investments safer and prevent them from \u201cwithering\u201d away like altcoins.\nBeing a sidechain, the company said that Rootstock would not have a typical alternative token for pre-sale but provide a two-way peg between Rootstock\u2019s native currency RTC and Bitcoin. In order to use the RSK system users would have to transfer bitcoins from their accounts to the Rootstock sidechain. Which would then be converted to RTC, but can also be reverted to BTC at any time.\n\u201cAs a result of being a sidechain Rootstock will not issue a new currency or token. Instead in order to pay for Rootstock transactions there will be a two-way peg between the native Rootstock token called RTC, and Bitcoin.\u201d the\u00a0blog post reads.\nIn order to make the transactions more secure, the RSK system will use the services of a group of leading Bitcoin companies called the \u201cfederation.\u201d The federation will enable the exchange between the blockchain and the RSK side chain. \u00a0Every transaction on the RSK system will be subjected to fees, which will serve as a financial incentive to the federation members. \u00a0\nIn a technical\u00a0white paper released last year, the company said that adding new features such as smart contracts to Bitcoin is necessary to improve its acceptance as the global cryptocurrency, and Rootstock was created with that purpose in mind.\n\u201cWe believe that new use cases are necessary in order for Bitcoin to become the leading global cryptocurrency, and that adding smart-contract capabilities is key to secure that future.\n\u201cWith that in mind we created Rootstock (RSK), a smart-contract platform that incorporates a Turing Complete Virtual Machine to Bitcoin. It also provides other enhancements to the network such as faster transactions and better scalability, features that we also believe will enable new usage scenarios.\u201d the paper reads. \u00a0\nComparison to Counterparty\nRootstock has been compared to Counterparty, another smart contracts platform that makes use of the Bitcoin network and a native token, XCP, to do smart contracts. However, Sergio Lerner, co-founder of Rootstock, says that Rootstock has several advantages over Counterparty. \u00a0\nTalking to IBTimes, Lerner said that Rootstock's Virtual Machine has various advantages over Counterparty in terms of contract execution transaction time.\u00a0\n\"From a technical perspective, Rootstock's Virtual Machine offers JIT (just-in-time) compiling for improved contract execution of up to 100 times; Web3 support to enable easy integration with DApps (Distributed Apps) that have a rich user interfaces [sic] and higher rate of user interaction as blocks are validated every 20 seconds versus the standard 10 minutes Counterparty requires.\u201d\u00a0Lerner said.\u00a0\nTalking about economic incentives for miners, Lerner said that since all of the contract executions on Counterparty are paid in Counterparty\u2019s proprietary token XCP, it offers very few economic incentives for miners in comparison to Rootstock.\u00a0\nLerner said that Counterparty\u2019s proprietary token XCP lacks market and user base to provide liquidity and price stability. \u00a0\n\u201cFrom an economic perspective, Counterparty offers few if any incentives to Bitcoin miners as contract execution is paid through XCP transactions that are obscure to them, letting miners \u00a0profit only from regular Bitcoin transaction fees.\u201d Lerner said. \u201cAlso using a proprietary token poses the challenge to create new markets and user adoption in order to provide liquidity and price stability.\u201d\nAs for Rootstock, there is currently no code available for testing, and the team has not released any information about how far they have come regarding development. But this has not prevented them from attracting investors. On March 21, 2016, RSK Labs announced it had raised $1 million in funding from Bitmain, Coinsilium, and the Digital Currency Group to complete the development of its technical plans.", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 21}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nZcash, which is an implementation of the zerocash concept, is often referred to as the first form of truly anonymous digital cash. While Bitcoin been called a haven for criminals by many misinformed individuals, the reality is Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s creation is a mostly-transparent ledger.\nAlthough Zcash enables the highest level of privacy currently allowed by cryptography, there are still some potential issues (mostly unrelated to privacy) for the financial-anonymity protocol to overcome. Zcash CEO Zooko Wilcox-O\u2019Hearn recently discussed some of these issues on Epicenter Bitcoin.\nPrivacy Preserving Spends Take a Minute or Two to Generate\nThe main issue with Zcash right now is that generating a new privacy-preserving spend is somewhat inefficient. Zooko, as he is commonly known, explained this issue during his recent Epicenter Bitcoin appearance:\n\n\u201cThe current alpha code that we have running on a testnet \u2012 it takes like about a minute or two of CPU time to generate a new privacy-preserving spend and only like a few milliseconds, I think, to verify. The latter part is for the good for performance, and that\u2019s really important because all the full nodes and the miners have to be doing verifications all the time. The former part is pretty bad because it takes a whole minute or two on like a high-powered, supercomputer 64-bit laptop CPU.\u201d\n\nZooko also added that privacy-preserving spend generation likely requires more than 4 gigabytes of RAM, although he also mentioned that they don\u2019t have precise measurements on RAM requirements quite yet.\nIn regard to the consequences of the current system requirements involved with privacy-preserving spends, Zooko stated:\n\n\u201cThat is totally prohibitive for certain use cases like generating a new spend on your smartphone, for starters. Also, anything that\u2019s got a real low-latency requirement where you get incoming money you receive and then like a millisecond later you need to spend that money to someone else right away \u2012 that\u2019s totally impossible with the current protocol.\u201d\n\nWith the current version of Zcash, there are definitely efficiency and usability tradeoffs. Having said that, this system is also intended to give users the highest level of financial anonymity and privacy.\nGetting Around Zcash\u2019s Efficiency Issues\nAlthough Zcash\u2019s privacy-preserving transactions are somewhat inefficient, the digital currency\u2019s users also have the ability to make traditional, transparent transactions, which are similar to Bitcoin transactions. Zooko explained that using a hybrid of privacy-preserving and transparent transactions on the Zcash blockchain can still offer many advantages over a traditional Bitcoin transaction.\u00a0\n\u201cThe existence of the privacy-preserving transactions means that they break the links of the chain of transaction history,\u201d the Zcash CEO noted.\nZooko also explained how a combination of private and non-private transactions would work in greater detail:\n\n\u201cThere might be ways around it because if you have a buffer of money you can spend it using a privacy-preserving payment, so there\u2019s no linkage between where it came to you. Then, you can privately spend it to a new address. So, there\u2019s no linkage in the blockchain between where you got it and that new address that currently controls it. Then, you could do a non-private spend of it directly from that address.\u201d\n\nHaving said that, Zooko also stated this type of usage of the Zcash blockchain will not offer the greatest level of privacy for its users. He stated:\n\n\u201cEarlier I said, \u2018Zcash offers the maximum possible privacy that cryptography can provide.\u2019 And that is true \u2012 if all you ever do with it is the privacy-preserving spends. Then, you\u2019re putting as little information as possible into the blockchain.\u201d\n\nMissing Out on Some of Bitcoin\u2019s Functionality\nIn addition to Zcash\u2019s efficiency issues, the \u201cHTTPS for money\u201d also cannot enable many useful features of Bitcoin in its subset of privacy-preserving transactions. Zooko explained:\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bunch of functionality in the Bitcoin \u2012 or the globally transparent protocol \u2012 that we can\u2019t do with a privacy-preserving spend \u2012 like multisignature transactions. Those are really important in Bitcoin. There\u2019s a lot of really cool things being built with multisignature transactions.\u201d\nHe then clarified his point further:\n\n\u201cZcash can do multisignature transactions using the globally transparent subset of the protocol, but when you want to do a privacy-preserving spend, you can\u2019t do multisignature.\u201d\n\nAlthough there are still some issues with the Zcash protocol, it\u2019s clear that the availability of a truly anonymous cash system is\u00a0desired by the vast majority of the digital currency community. This sort of cryptographically-ensured privacy should become more usable over time. Perhaps the currently-available testnet version of Zcash should be viewed as an early preview of what\u2019s to come in the future of privacy-conscious digital currencies.\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

Now, that is one of Wirex card\u2019s main features.\u201d\nThere are three key features of Wirex, one of which Lazarichev described. The two-way debit cards will allow customers to convert Bitcoin into traditional currencies (U.S. dollars, British pounds, euros) and \u201clock in\u201d rates in advance.\nInstant remittance service is another feature of Wirex, which was designed using blockchain technology. Money transfers will be able to be conducted quickly and securely via Wirex.\nFinally, Wirex will be accessible with an app, which is set to debut on both iOS and Android. It includes the security features of BitGo, and all funds are protected under XL Group, an insurance service provider.\nUsers will be able to integrate their individual Wirex accounts with PayPal, Amazon and Skrill. Future partnerships may arise, but it\u2019s not a primary objective for Wirex Limited at the moment.\n\u201cOur main focus now is to ensure the Wirex platform works flawlessly with PayPal, Amazon and Skrill,\u201d Lazarichev continued. \u201cWe believe that quantity is not important if the quality is sacrificed.

Gox in early 2014, then the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world, Japan built a firewall separating Bitcoin from the financial sector. Banks were barred from buying and selling bitcoins, and securities firms were prevented from trading the virtual currency.\nThe proposed regulations would remove the firewall between Bitcoin and the financial sector, according to the Nikkei. Commercial banks would be allowed to provide Bitcoin to customers, and securities firms would be allowed to trade the virtual currency. The government hopes that removing the firewall will encourage the development of Japan\u2019s emerging fintech industry.\nThe regulations, if passed by the Diet, would mark the first concrete step in a years-long debate about how to deal with Bitcoin. But not all Diet members are pleased with the proposal.\nTsukasa Akimoto, a member of the ruling Liberal Democratic party, asked Finance Minister Aso in a budget meeting in early February if maintaining the consumption tax on Bitcoin transactions would set Japan against the global trend. In response, Aso cited other countries such as Australia that also tax transactions using the virtual currency. As the proposal stands, Japan would continue to levy an 8 percent consumption tax on all purchases made with Bitcoin.\nContinuing to tax Bitcoin will put Japan at a disadvantage and discourage its use by consumers, says Yuzo Kano, leader of the Japan Authority of Digital Assets, an industry group that advocates for virtual currencies. Kano says that Japan is \u201cgoing against the world,\u201d and that continuing the consumption tax will hurt Japan\u2019s competitiveness in the emerging fintech ecosystem.\nAccording to Kano, international Bitcoin traders make a business of \u201cimporting\u201d bitcoins into Japan from untaxed exchanges overseas. Kano is calling for a \u201clevel playing field\u201d to stop the importation of Bitcoin from other countries.\nThe U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ruled in September that Bitcoin is a commodity, empowering the agency to monitor businesses that trade the virtual currency. Because Bitcoin is classified as property in the United States, states and cities can levy sales taxes on Bitcoin transactions, although none have done so. On the other side of the Atlantic, the European Union Court ruled in October that Bitcoin is a currency, not a commodity, and therefore cannot be taxed.\nOf the Group of 7 countries, only Japan taxes purchases made with Bitcoin. The upcoming G7 meeting in May will be held in Japan, and how to regulate virtual currencies is set to be a major topic of discussion.\nWhether or not Japan continues to tax Bitcoin transactions, Bitcoin exchanges would face increased scrutiny under the proposed regulations. Exchanges would have to meet a mandatory minimum capital requirement of 10 million yen, keep company and customer assets separate and submit to auditing by certified public accountants.\nExchanges would also be required to follow the same know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) rules as banks and other financial service providers, confirming the identities of clients and reporting suspicious trading to financial authorities.\nAccording to Motokazu Endo, an attorney specializing in financial legislation, many of Japan\u2019s Bitcoin exchanges have weak financial bases, which the proposed regulations could expose.\nThis is a guest post by Scott Dylan, and the views are those of the author.\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 10}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nAndrew Poelstra is a mathematician at Blockstream and was recently part of a panel discussion on improvements for Bitcoin at the 2016 MIT Bitcoin Expo. During the panel, Poelstra discussed Confidential Transactions, which is a privacy-enhancing feature he has been working on with Blockstream co-founders and Bitcoin Core contributors Greg Maxwell and Pieter Wuille.\nOne of the main reasons Blockstream is working on Confidential Transactions is to preserve the censorship-resistant properties of Bitcoin and other blockchains.\nScalability Is Not the Only Problem with Bitcoin\nAlthough scalability solutions have been a major area of contention lately, Poelstra understands this is not the only real problem. During his recent appearance at the MIT Bitcoin Expo, Poelstra pointed out the issues related to the public nature of Bitcoin transactions:\n\u201cLately, we\u2019ve been talking about scaling and centralization, but that\u2019s not the only problem with Bitcoin. This one may be a bit attractable, which is that all transactions are public and all of the information in all the transactions are public. This allows a lot of analysis to happen . . . [People] can infer a lot about transactions just from the amounts and also the shape of the transactions.\u201d\nIndeed, there are a number of different startups working to deanonymize the Bitcoin blockchain every day. In the past, Stash co-founder and Open Transactions creator Chris Odom has stated these companies could go out of business as more privacy-enhancing features are enabled on the blockchain.\nCentralization of Mining Threatens Censorship Resistance\nAt the core of Bitcoin\u2019s value proposition is censorship resistance. Bitcoin has value because it can be used to complete transactions that are likely to be censored on other payment networks. Andrew Poelstra is committed to preserving this aspect of the technology.\nThe centralization of mining is one of the current weak points in Bitcoin due to the attack vector opened up when the people who are processing transactions can possibly identify transactions they or regulators don\u2019t like. Poelstra hit on this point during the panel discussion at the MIT Bitcoin Expo:\n\u201cOne reason we\u2019re worried about the centralization of mining is that miners are, sort of, gatekeepers to what transactions can go in the blockchain and what can\u2019t.\u201d\nThis desire to weaken the negative effects of Bitcoin mining centralization is what pushes Poelstra and others to work on Confidential Transactions. With Confidential Transactions, privacy is improved by cryptographically masking the amounts associated with Bitcoin transactions. When this privacy-enhancing feature is used, onlookers are unlikely to be able to figure out which addresses are change addresses, which means it\u2019s difficult to tell which Bitcoin address is receiving a payment.\nConfidential Transactions Can Help\nCoinJoin, originally proposed by Greg Maxwell, has been around since 2013, but there are still some major issues with the privacy-focused tool. Poelstra mentioned how Confidential Transactions can improve CoinJoin during the panel discussion:\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to do a CoinJoin in a way that improves privacy, and it\u2019s also very difficult to measure how much privacy we get. By hiding amounts, we allow combining transactions in a way that we no longer have this clear correlation. [With Confidential Transactions], I have a couple of outputs, Mark has a couple of outputs, and nobody can see the amounts. When we put them together, now it\u2019s just a pile of outputs with no one else associated.\u201d\nKeeping scalability in mind, Blockstream has been focused on making Confidential Transactions as efficient as possible. When Confidential Transactions is combined with CoinJoin, it becomes much more difficult to censor transactions as a miner because there is more difficulty associated with identifying the individuals behind specific transactions.\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nOnename\u00a0founders Ryan Shea and Muneeb Ali were recently interviewed on an episode of \u00a0Epicenter Bitcoin, and the early portion of the conversation focused on the duo\u2019s overall goals for their blockchain-based identity system. While most people see Onename as a company for online identity and login verification, Shea and Ali\u2019s vision goes far beyond that. The New York-based team see\u00a0their project as a way to help redecentralize the Internet by giving people a form of online ID over which\u00a0they have complete control. Shea and Ali expanded on these points during their discussion with Epicenter Bitcoin co-hosts S\u00e9bastien Couture and Meher Roy.\nProblems with Centralization on the Internet\nBefore explaining how Onename can help redecentralize the Internet, Ali explained the problems facing the Web right now. Although the Internet started out as a generally decentralized platform, centralization has started to creep into the system over the past fifteen years:\n\u201cWhen talking about the grand vision -- if you go back to the late \u201890s, you would see that the Internet used to be a much more decentralized place. People would go visit websites that were hosted on different servers, different hosting providers, and in the last fifteen years, one of the things that has happened is that it\u2019s becoming more and more centralized in the sense that everything, all forms of communication, are going through certain, central companies like Google [or] Facebook.\u201d\nAli explained that it is important to make sure that people do not have to rely on large, centralized institutions in the online world:\n\u201cMost user data is actually also with these companies, so one of the things that really excites us to work on this technology is the potential to kind of like redecentralize the Internet -- give the power back to the people, so that everyone who\u2019s using Internet services online doesn\u2019t have to rely on certain, critical, massive third parties in the middle.\u201d\nRemoving Reliance on Centralized Institutions\nIn addition to helping to redecentralize the Internet, Shea explained that another goal of Onename is to allow users to bring an online identity with them as they navigate through the Internet. Facebook, Google, Twitter and other social media platforms are already popular options for logging into various websites around the Web, but Onename plans to offer similar functionality without having to provide personal information to another third party:\n\u201cThe other component is being able to give users the ability to bring their identities with them when they login online -- putting them in control and putting them in the center of their relationship with any application, so that when they signup for an app they don\u2019t actually need to actually rely on Facebook or Google or any other company. And they can also have a really, really good experience that is convenient (doesn\u2019t require passwords) and these users can bring an ID with them -- a very strong, verified ID with them, anywhere they go.\u201d\nAn ID Card for the Internet\nAlthough governments have provided usable identification systems in the real world, that kind of system does not exist on the Internet. Shea explained that Onename is working on building a platform that will allow users to control their own privacy and security:\n\u201cIn real life, we have a pretty good identification system in that we have passports, we have driver\u2019s licenses, and we can take them with us whenever we want to sign up for services. We don\u2019t have a very strong system for that online, and so we want to be able to bring that to users and bring that to people in a way that they are in complete control -- they can be in control of their privacy, their security\u00a0and the companies they interact with.\u201d\nMany Internet users may be wary of any kind of online identification system, but it\u2019s important to remember that some form of online ID can be extremely useful in certain situations. If you\u2019re going to participate in certain forms of online activity, such as e-commerce or social media, it sometimes make sense to use some form of real-world identification. It should also be noted that pseudonyms can still be used with these types of systems. Online forms of ID should not be viewed negatively by default. It only makes sense to fear these sorts of systems when they\u2019re implemented by force.", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 8}

This removes the dependence on other currencies such as the U.S. dollar that have high international conversion rates.\nBitFury CEO Valery Vavilov told Bitcoin Magazine there has been a serious lack of investment in financial infrastructure across Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\u201cThis has resulted in the highest FX margins globally,\u201d he said. \u201cIncoming transfers to Sub-Saharan Africa average 12 percent with bank transfers often taking a week or more to settle.\u201d\nHowever, by offering a fast, easy and efficient way to buy and sell African currencies, more companies can do business with and across the African continent.\nWhy Invest in BitPesa?\nBitPesa is an Authorized Payment Institution that is licensed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). It has gained a solid reputation within the Bitcoin community as well as with international businesses by maintaining close relationships with those it works with.\nUnderstanding the solid presence of BitPesa around Africa, BitFury decided that by establishing a strategic relationship with BitPesa, which was made under the\u00a0 BitFury Capital investment arm, the two companies would be able to deliver a secure and transparent way of exchanging money to those who use Bitcoin. The investment will also help grow the Bitcoin trading platform and universal payment system BitPesa is offering.\n\u201cPartnering with BitPesa was a perfect fit,\u201d said Vavilov. \u201cNot only is BitPesa Africa\u2019s fastest and most affordable Bitcoin trading platform, but the company is also working to expand across the pan-African continent to provide access to fast and secure payments to millions of people.\u201d\nBy partnering with local networks and payment networks, BitPesa is working to make Bitcoin payments accessible to the public who face obstacles to financial growth and those who are underserved by the banks. Since BitPesa is licensed by the FCA, it is a more trusted way of sending and receiving money compared to using informal brokers or cash agents, which is the typical route in Africa for most people who want to exchange currency nationally and internationally.\nBitPesa CEO Elizabeth Rossiello told Bitcoin Magazine that the Bitcoin blockchain technology enables the company's instantaneous and secure transfer of funds.\n\u201cEvery transaction is secured by the Bitcoin blockchain, which is a public unalterable ledger of transactions,\u201d she said. \u201cBitPesa also enforces strict KYC [Know Your Customer] and AML [Anti-Money Laundering] policies for every customer transaction.\u201d\nWhat Does the Future Hold for BitPesa?\nWhen BitPesa first started it was simply acting as a way for expat and freelance workers from the U.K. to be able to send money to friends and family in Kenya. The company gained a lot of attention in Kenya, enabling it to generate sufficient revenue to expand its services into Nigeria, Uganda and Tanzania.\nDue to the heightened demand for Bitcoin, BitPesa was able to provide its customers with a trading platform using Bitcoin that gave users access to low conversion rates as they traded in the digital currency.\nAccording to GSMA, a mobile telecom industry trade body, there are\u00a0 around 370 million mobile subscribers in Sub-Saharan Africa. The organization has predicted that by 2020 the number of smartphones will increase to half a billion.\nWith such a popular mobile phone market and a lack of existing financial services, the African continent is fertile ground for increased adoption of Bitcoin in the near future. With the financial assistance and network of BitFury, BitPesa aims to drive the implementation of Bitcoin in the African region where its potential to change financial services is great.\n\u201cWe believe in BitPesa\u2019s mission,\u201d said Vavilov. \u201c[We] are excited to help the company grow, bringing the power of transformative technology for the benefit of people.\u201d\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 11}

The banks connected on an R3-managed private peer-to-peer distributed ledger, powered by Ethereum technology and hosted on a virtual private network in the Microsoft Azure Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) cloud, to execute simulated financial transactions instantaneously.\nR3 is expanding its comparative evaluation project to include other banks, distributed ledger technologies\u00a0and cloud computing platforms. The latest R3 announcement reveals that the group experimented with five distinct blockchain technologies in parallel in the first test of its kind. The trial represented the trading of fixed income assets between 40 of the world\u2019s largest banks across the blockchains, using five different distributed ledger technologies built by Chain, Eris Industries, Ethereum, IBM and Intel.\n\u201c[The banks] evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of each technology by running smart contracts that were programmed to facilitate issuance, secondary trading and redemption of commercial paper, a short-term fixed income security typically issued by corporations to raise funding,\u201d notes the R3 press release, which includes informative statements from the companies whose technologies were assessed in the trial.\n\u201cThis development further supports R3's belief that close collaboration among global financial institutions and technology providers will create significant momentum behind the adoption of distributed ledger solutions across the industry,\u201d said R3 CEO David Rutter. \u201cThese technologies represent a new frontier of innovation and will dramatically improve the way the financial services industry operates, in much the same way as the advent of electronic trading decades ago delivered huge advancements in efficiency, transparency, scalability and security.\u201d\nEach of the distributed ledgers ran a smart contract based on identical business logic to enable the banks to accurately compare the difference in performance between them. Cloud computing resources were provided by Microsoft Azure, IBM Bluemix and Amazon AW, to host the distributed ledgers.\nING Bank, a Dutch multinational banking and financial services corporation headquartered in Amsterdam with more than 48 million individual and institutional clients in more than 40 countries, participated in the trial. ING Bank joined R3 in November, stating that joining R3 was the next step with blockchain technology to collaborate on research, design and engineering that will advance innovative solutions for clients that meet banking requirements for security, reliability, performance, scalability and auditing.\n\u201cThe trial marked an unprecedented scale of institutional collaboration between the financial and technology communities exploring how distributed ledgers can be applied to global financial markets,\u201d notes ING\u2019s announcement of the latest R3 blockchain test.\n\u201cIt is great to see that the trials are bringing all parties so much closer together,\u201d said ING Global Head of Payments Jurgen Vroegh, who is leading the project for ING. \u201cThe engagement between the member banks at all levels and across all disciplines was very intense and full of enthusiasm. With constructive in-depth communication we really managed to create an expert community. The trials gave us a higher level of understanding of the various technology options and insight on how smart contracts can really work on a distributed ledger.\u201d\n\"The successful trial of the five cloud-based emerging blockchain technologies in parallel gave us a lot of insights into how smart contracts work,\u201d Vroegh told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cVery interesting to learn was that while they all started out with the same basic business assumptions, they all came up with different possible solutions. The insight this gave us is that there are many possible ways to implement smart contracts and that there is still much more for us to discover and many choices to be made.\"\nWhile Vroegh\u2019s diplomatic statement\u00a0shows that it\u2019s too early to expect a \u201cwinner\u201d to emerge from R3\u2019s comparative study, its open-endedness is informative. In fact, it seems likely that different distributed ledger technologies will coexist, each optimized for specific applications.\nR3 will continue to work with the banks in its Global Collaborative Lab over the coming months to test and develop applications based on distributed ledger technology for the financial services industry. According to R3, the Lab has quickly become a center of gravity for collaborative applied blockchain efforts in the financial services and distributed ledger technology industries.\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 9}

In the territory\u2019s 2016-17 budget, Financial Secretary John Tsang laid out a plan for the government to support blockchain technology development by encouraging its application in financial services, including reducing suspicious transactions and bringing down transaction costs.\nThe 2016-17 budget aims to support 150 fintech startups over the next five years in Hong Kong Island\u2019s Cyberport, and arrange for 300 students to train in fintech overseas. It will also provide training for the financial services industry in blockchain matters and promote relevant technologies to develop products and services.\nAs Hong Kong\u2019s government takes positive steps to foster blockchain technology and wider fintech incubation, Bitcoin Magazine spoke to ANX International\u2019s CEO Ken Lo to get his perspective on the benefits to adopting blockchain technology and recent developments in Hong Kong.\nANX International is at the center of the innovation in Hong Kong\u2019s digital assets ecosystem, offering a one-stop shop for blockchain development. As well as carrying out coin development, building white label trading platforms in primary and secondary markets, and integrating digital currencies into debit cards, ANX is pioneering the use of the blockchain in compliance.\nWhile the regulators are proactively encouraging blockchain technology, do you feel that banks and financial services firms are sufficiently aware of the cost savings available from adopting this\u00a0technology?\nBlockchain is still very new and perceived as risky by many banks and financial services firms. In the past year, these institutions have done their research and are now aware of the benefits of blockchain technology.\nThis is really where ANX excels, as we have been helping companies realize and implement the benefits of blockchain technology for over two years now. We are the only one-stop shop for institutions and businesses to be able to get advisory, systems integration and managed services in blockchain technology today. We provide our software as a service (SaaS) platform globally, so businesses can get on board with blockchain technology in less than 10 days. We provide the digital assets, exchange platform\u00a0and managed services so the businesses don't have to invest any capex [capital expenditures] to integrate our services.\nBusinesses integrating such services will benefit, but what are the practical benefits of wider adoption and integration of digital assets into exchanges for the industry as a whole?\nExchanges can help with the liquidity and integration of blockchain digital assets into traditional networks. The more points of presence the easier it is for the adoption and realization of benefits such as convenience for users.\nHong Kong\u2019s government has recognised the importance of blockchain in financial services, including in reducing suspicious transactions and transaction costs. How could blockchain influence the way financial institutions comply with anti-money laundering (AML), know your customer (KYC) and other regulations?\nBlockchain is an excellent platform that can support AML and KYC with its built-in encryption of transactions that is tamper-proof. Applications built on top of the blockchain can be assured of its integrity. With such a secure and transparent platform, all transactions can be traced and matched with identifiable origins.\nThe 2016-17 budget aims to step up blockchain innovation, fintech and startup incubation. Given Hong Kong\u2019s historically low research and development spending, do you feel this goes far enough?\nThere is always room for improvement.

{"title": "How Blockchains Can Further Public Science", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/how-blockchains-can-further-public-science-1457972964/", "birthday": "Mar 14, 2016  12:29 PM EST", "date": "2016-03-14 17:29:00", "content": "This is a guest post by Zach Ramsay.\u00a0Zach is a developer at Eris Industries and a\u00a0prior academic, where he\u00a0was successful at teaching toads, then rats to play video games. Making science better with blockchains (and IPFS!) is what keeps him up at night.\u00a0\nThe thing that had me most excited about Bitcoin back in 2013 was its potential to re-align the incentives in academia and re-define how science and research is conducted.\nAt the time, I was spending my days training rats in Skinner boxes to hunt crickets, listening to every possible Bitcoin explainer I could get my hands on. It took a good two years, and now the problem set is much clearer. This post is a think-piece on how academia might be improved with blockchain technology.\nIn what follows, I\u2019ll discuss the problems that perturbed me the most and highlight potential solutions.\nTaught in every Research Methods 101 course, the file-drawer problem \u2013 more generally referred to as publication bias \u2013 does perhaps the most disservice to the scientific community at large. Allow me to explain.\nAlice is a researcher in cell biology. One night she dreams up an idea for a potentially groundbreaking experiment. Alice does the experiment, but does not get the result she expected. Alice tweaks a few parameters and tries again. Again, the result doesn\u2019t fit her hypothesis. She eventually abandons this \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d idea and moves on to other things.\nBob is also a cell biology researcher. Independently of Alice \u2013 but after reading much of the same literature \u2013 Bob dreams up a similar \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d experiment. After many tries, Bob also fails to get the expected result. Bob moves on.\nWhat\u2019s the problem here? Bob duplicated Alice\u2019s efforts. Why? Alice\u2019s efforts were not accessible to Bob; instead, they were siloed away under \u201cthings-that-don\u2019t-work\u201d on her hard drive.\nBoth Alice and Bob have Internet. From a technical point of view, it should be really easy for Bob to access all the experiments Alice tried. But it isn\u2019t easy. Why?\nPut simply: incentives. Publishing a \u201cnon-result\u201d in a \u201cthird-tier\u201d journal won\u2019t advance Alice\u2019s career the way a \u201csignificant\u201d result in, say, Nature will. Writing up the article and going through the submission process probably won\u2019t happen because nobody has time for that. Even though science advances mostly when we discover what doesn\u2019t work; most of what doesn\u2019t work, isn\u2019t known. Instead, everything that doesn\u2019t work is locked up in that researchers\u2019 file drawer.\nAlice could very well publish her results informally on her blog, or to a handful of journals (e.g. Plos ONE) that don\u2019t use statistical significance as a metric for publication (but still charge hefty publication fees). Although things are changing, this is far from the norm. And, as far as I could tell from 5 years in academia, the scale of duplicate work across labs around the world is both unknowable and likely enormous. It isn\u2019t time consuming for these data to be published, but I suspect many academics don\u2019t feel it is worth their time, or that the contribution isn\u2019t meaningful enough if it isn\u2019t in a prestigious journal, or that it won\u2019t be archived and indexed properly. Who knows?\nWhat is known is that it\u2019s definitely a problem.\nThe concepts of pre-registering experiments and widening the scope of acceptable citations begin to address this issue and will likely reap enormous benefits across academia. (I\u2019ll have more to say on this in the future with respect to smart contract factories for experiments). However, the challenge \u2013 assuming we want this knowledge free, distributed, and easily accessible (forever) to anyone with an Internet connection \u2013 is archiving and indexing all the content such that our assumption is satisfied.\nThe emergence of the Sci-Hub (see the Robin Hood of Science for the an excellent review) is promising in that it provides free access to vast stores of human knowledge; knowledge otherwise inaccessible if Elsevier had their way. But this solution is not distributed and, as far as I can tell, offers no permanent archival solution.\nEnter the InterPlanetary File System: IPFS has emerged as the most likely candidate for long-term knowledge preservation. Using (among other future-proofing features) content-based addressing (a hash) rather than location-based addressing (a URL), reliance on central servers is all but eliminated.\nAnd IPFS definitely plays nice with blockchains. Enter indexing. We need a registry to both track the hashes of all relevant content and update them. Ideally, such a registry would be shared across many educational institutions, which would be validators on a permissioned consortium blockchain. This strikes me as a likely direction for such institutions that are having to re-invent themselves in the digital age. Indeed, they should be the ones retaining the intellectual property\u00a0of the researcher, not for-profit journals!\nThis was the underlying motivation behind the toadserver. It takes an uploaded file, gets its IPFS hash, registers the file name and hash in the eris:db name registry and finally, adds the file to any number of IPFS nodes. It\u2019s really just a glorified database, but with write permissions across stakeholders who might not fully trust each other. This is all well and good, though it\u2019s not going to revolutionize science overnight.\nAnother failing of academic research is its inability to effectively incorporate user-generated content. As a student of animal behavior, I watch in awe at the scientifically interesting (and relevant) discussion about tricking your cat into a circle and wonder how to parse this content into useful data that might lead to a scientifically sound conclusion.\nAs far as I can tell, the public has a thirst to understand \u2013 and participate in \u2013 scientific inquiry; a thirst left wholly unquenched by mainstream academia. Publishers that charge 40 bucks per article aren\u2019t helping either. A big challenge \u2013 likely solved by creative incentive/reputation schemes \u2013 is compensating researchers for their time. That discussion is probably too early to have.\nIn the meantime, how can we aggregate useful user-generated content to improve the throughput of scientific research? The current focus of using a blockchain to streamline financial services is fine, but let\u2019s talk about automating knowledge discovery.\nWhen first dreaming up chain-based apps, one idea in particular stuck with me. Population dynamics \u2013 the study of geographical distribution of life on earth i.e., analyzing \u201cwhere life is\u201d \u2013 is both a logistical nightmare and labor intensive. Roughly: 1) get a research grant, 2) hire some graduate students, 3) gather data (field work), and 4) analyze & publish the data. The problem: 1) is time-consuming and ultra-competitive, 2) is fairly easy, 3) is time-consuming, as is 4) since it\u2019s rarely outsourced and the raw data is usually siloed away anyway. Five years later, the research team has a conclusion about ant diversity in one small region of Africa. Science is incremental indeed.\nLast week, Google released to the public its Cloud Vision API, a nifty set of tools for analyzing images. For example, if you send it a picture of what is clearly a marmot, the API will return a response with the description \u201cmarmot\u201d and a match score (i.e., degree of certainty that the image is, in fact, a marmot). What happens when you combine this functionality with a blockchain?\nAll of a sudden, the submission of content (well, images) that meet specific parameters (quality is in the eye of the beholder) can be incentivized. That is, the content can be checked for its purported authenticity before being added to a shared database for subsequent analysis. For example, the Marmot Recovery Foundation\u2019s Observer Program could have a mobile app that allows users to submit geo-tagged images of marmots to be used for analysis in exchange for tokens \u2013 tokens redeemable for marmot merchandise.\nPerhaps the budding school-aged scientist of the future will spend his days traipsing through the woods, taking pictures of ants, classifying them and adding everything to a chain run by a consortium of colleges and universities. The better the classifications he submits, the more tokens he earns \u2013 tokens redeemable at any of the participating institutions as tuition, for example. Applications like the LifeScanner app and PlantNet\u00a0get us closer to such a goal.\nEnough talk. About a week ago, I put together the Marmot Checker, which is another piece of the puzzle in terms of automating knowledge generation throughput. Briefly, an image is uploaded, processed, and sent to the Google Cloud Vision API to get descriptions of the image; these descriptions are checked against a user-defined list of words, and if there is a match, the image is added to the toadserver. Although the implementation is quite is simple, a few hundred lines more of code and you\u2019d have, say, a smart contract that sends the submitter of matched content some amount of tokens as a function of the match score and/or the users\u2019 reputation.\nOn the whole, this is part a growing set of tools for the scientific community. Already we\u2019re seeing more and more startups building tools to streamline the collaboration workflow process between research laboratories.\nThat won\u2019t cut it so long as the data is siloed within research labs/groups, journals are pay-per-view for the public and the average citizen hasn\u2019t the means or method to contribute meaningfully to global shared knowledge. After all, shouldn\u2019t citizen science really be called science proper? With blockchains I think it can be.\nThe fight for open access to knowledge has been an ongoing battle \u2013 a battle that ultimately took Aaron Swartz\u2019s life while simultaneously stalling the progress of humanity and lining the pockets of shareholders. All this to protect copyright yet in clear violation of the Univerisal Declaration of Human Rights Article 27 which states that \u201ceveryone has the right freely to \u2026 share in scientific advancement and its benefits.\u201d\nScience is ultimately a public endeavor, and making that dream a reality now appears possible with blockchains.", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 14}

The Project is exploring developing an open source blockchain.\nAt the meeting, JPMorgan Executive Director David Voell revealed that the bank has been working on Juno since September. The prototype was presented by Will Martino, one of the developers of the project.\nMartino said the team had considered methods besides proof of work and proof of stake, and began Juno from a fork of the Haskell implementation of Tangaroa, a Byzantine Fault Tolerant implementation of the consensus algorithm Raft.\nHe mentioned that as Juno doesn\u2019t require anonymous participation, this has been explicitly disabled. Use of Tangaroa also removes the need for mining.\nUsing the Raft protocol as a basis allows a cluster of servers to order messages and distribute them to the network. Within the network, election of a \"Leader\" ensures that consensus can be reached among the \"Followers.\" Martino explained that as Juno requires only consensus on inputs and not outputs, slow nodes are less likely to slow down the whole system.\nWhen messages transmitted within the network have been ordered and replicated, they are interpreted by a replicated state machine. Juno allows the Leader to feed an input into the state machine when an entry has been replicated by the majority of nodes.\nJuno is making use of a language named Hopper in its replicated state machine in order to run smart contracts. The language is still in development. When complete, it is expected to be sequentially consistent, fully deterministic, completely serializable, and will include a measure of execution cost.\nFor the immutable ledger itself, the JPMorgan team has not gone for Bitcoin-style Merkle trees. Instead, they use a Tangaroa-style incrementally hashed log of entries. This essentially creates a blockchain of single transaction blocks, reducing the potential for forking. The team is currently considering whether to further secure the log through a hash at checkpoints at set times, or to use a hash several steps behind the latest transaction.\nThe team has identified issues that would require human input to fix, including differences in incremental hashes among Followers in the network.\nConsidering the debate over blockchain capacity in the Bitcoin network, scalability is, of course, the elephant in the room. With an un-optimized instance running on a MacBook Pro, Juno managed throughput of consensus of 500 per second, and 2ms latency of consensus. This is very big news. Due to restrictions in its block size, Bitcoin can process only up to seven transactions per second. In comparison, Visa\u2019s network processes on average around 2,000 transactions per second.\nThe Juno team forecasts two to three times its current performance with basic optimizations including GC tuning, batching log entries and messaging layer configuration.\nA stable version of the code has been posted on GitHub for anyone considering trying it. According to the JPMorgan team, the open source version performs slightly worse than the internal version used in tests.\nThe features the JPMorgan team hopes to include in the next release of Juno include additional node states, integrated client command HTTP servers, persistence via SQLite, and system monitoring integration.", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 10}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nBitcoin Classic, an attempt to implement an alternative version of the Bitcoin protocol with a higher block size limit, has been one of the biggest stories in the blockchain space over the past few months, and one of the key areas of debate over this new software client has to do with the 75 percent network hashrate activation threshold for a potential hard fork.\nMany contributors to Bitcoin Core think the 75 percent number chosen by the Bitcoin Classic team is too low, but the reality is that the hard fork is likely to activate at a level of support more than three percentage points lower.\nBitcoin XT Background\nNeighborhood Pool Watch is a popular Bitcoin mining blog operated by blockchain researcher Andrew Geyl. In August, Geyl made a post regarding some potential flaws in BIP 101, which was the block size increase proposal implemented by Bitcoin XT. One of the flaws pointed out by Geyl was that there was no expiration date on voting for Bitcoin XT in coinbase transactions. This means, theoretically, voting could continue forever.\nIn both Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic, the real method of hard fork activation is a count of miner votes from the last 1,000 blocks. If 750 of the last 1,000 blocks are found by miners who support the new, alternative protocol, then the hard fork is activated (although it doesn\u2019t actually take place until after a grace period). The problem here -- at least in terms of gauging miner support -- is that miners can get lucky and find more blocks than their actual share of the network would predict over the short term.\nAs an example of this issue in his post from August, Geyl noted:\n\u201cAfter a couple of years (if voting continued for so long) it's conceivable that a true proportion of just over two-thirds could activate BIP 101.\u201d\nReal Activation Threshold for Bitcoin Classic\nThe good news is that Bitcoin Classic has introduced an expiration date for its hard fork plans. If the hard fork to a 2-megabyte block size limit is not activated by January 1, 2018, then it is deemed a failure.\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Andrew Geyl to get his thoughts on the probability\u00a0of a hard fork activation below Classic\u2019s intended 75 percent threshold, and he stated:\n\u201cI estimate at most a 27 percent chance of activating with a true proportion of 70 percent of the network, but only after 100,000 blocks at that proportion, which would mean remaining at 70 percent for about two years. More realistically, the \u2018yes\u2019 voter proportion could stall for a few months, say 10,000 to 20,000 blocks, and in this case there's a 3 to 6 percent change of activating at 70 percent.\u201d\nGeyl also shared his thoughts on the level of support required for a hard fork to become likely:\n\u201cI think a true proportion of \u2018yes\u2019 voters at 70.5 percent to 71 percent of the network could activate Bitcoin classic early with 50 percent probability.\u201d\nIt\u2019s important to note the January 1, 2018 deadline isn\u2019t exactly set in stone. One has to wonder if supporters of the increased block size limit would simply roll over and give up if the 75 percent threshold is not met by that point in time. Although the relative abandonment of the Bitcoin XT project could indicate that these sorts of miner votes die out if real support is not gathered in a timely manner.\nA\u00a0hard fork by Bitcoin Core has also become more likely over the past few weeks.\nWhat Is an Acceptable Threshold?\nTangentially related to this issue of true hard fork activation thresholds is the issue of at what level of consensus or support from miners a hard fork should be activated. Bitcoin Core is sticking with the 95 percent threshold that has been used in the past, while others are convinced a 75 percent (or even 51 percent) threshold is fair game.\nThere are tradeoffs with any selected threshold. Ninety-five percent support requires near-universal consensus on a change, so development is likely to be slower. Seventy-five percent support would allow changes to Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules to happen much more rapidly, but it also opens the door to changes that aren\u2019t universally agreed upon as good ideas.\nThe differing opinions on the required levels of support from the network hashrate to activate a hard fork are a great example of how the so-called block size debate is about much more than the block size limit.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 3}

The BitTorrent technology for distributed file storage and peer-to-peer transfers, one of the biggest developments in Internet technology since the Web itself, opens the way to a distributed, fully decentralized Internet.\nA decentralized Internet would be much more resilient than today\u2019s framework of central servers, in spite of the associated piracy often in the news headlines. There isn\u2019t much the authorities can do to prevent BitTorrent users from exchanging files. But users need to know that downloadable files are available, and then search torrents on centralized torrent sites such as The Pirate Bay. The centralized torrent sites are vulnerable to copyright enforcement countermeasures, ranging from domain seizure to actual server seizure.\n\u201cAn interesting torrent site has just debuted which has the honor of being almost shutdown-proof,\u201d TorrentFreak reports. \u201c'Play' has just appeared on ZeroNet, a serverless P2P network that uses Bitcoin cryptography and BitTorrent technology. As a result, Play might well be the first torrent site that offers magnet links while being hosted by its users.\u201d\nThe door was opened in 2015, when BitTorrent announced Project Maelstrom, a P2P browser based on BitTorrent technology for a new decentralized web.\n\u201cIt started with a simple question,\u201d said BitTorrent CEO Eric Klinker. \u201cWhat if more of the web worked the way BitTorrent does? Project Maelstrom begins to answer that question with our first public release of a web browser that can power a new way for web content to be published, accessed and consumed. Truly an Internet powered by people, one that lowers barriers and denies gatekeepers their grip on our future.\u201d\nProject Maelstrom started public beta testing in April and released preliminary open source development tools, but it doesn\u2019t seem to have progressed much to date.\nThe\u00a0Pirate Bay pre-announced a similar project in early 2015, but hasn't\u00a0release any code or project updates since. There is also MaidSafe, a project self-described as a \u201ccrowd-sourced Internet\u201d using advanced P2P technology to create a global decentralized network. The project continues to progress steadily, but hasn\u2019t released any spectacular killer app to date.\nThe Play torrent site and its underlying ZeroNet technology seem to work well enough to be considered as a real, usable prototype of a decentralized web. ZeroNet sites are served by users, without central points of failure. \u201cIt's nowhere because it's everywhere!\u201d\nAnyone can install ZeroNet in a couple of minutes, start surfing the P2P web, and create crowd-served ZeroNet websites. In particular, the ZeroNet creator has developed a working solution for dynamical\u00a0distributed websites, with real-time updates, which had eluded other developers to date. Dynamic decentralized web prototypes, including message boards and auto-refreshed real-time chat boards, are showcased on the ZeroNet front page -- not the zeronet.io website, but the crowd-served front page that appears in a browser window after installation -- and seem to work well.\nThe ZeroNet code is open source and available on Github. ZeroNet works over Tor, which provides additional anonymity options. Last but not least, ZeroNet is protected by the same cryptography used in the Bitcoin network, which opens up possibilities for Bitcoin integration.\nBitcoin Magazine spoke to the ZeroNet developer, who prefers to be known as \u201cTamas,\u201d to find out more.\n\u201cI live in Hungary, working as web developer, and ZeroNet is my hobby project,\u201d said Tamas. \u201cI started it in December 2014 and the first version was released in January 2015, so it's a relatively new project.\u201d Tamas explained that ZeroNet permits creating crowd-sourced websites without central servers. \u201cThe pages are hosted by the visitors, so there are no costs and anyone is able to create new websites,\u201d he said. To read ZeroNet sites, users have to run the ZeroNet client and then simply open ZeroNet sites in the browser.\n\u201cI'm worried that the Internet is becoming more and more centralized and controlled by big companies, we need to re-decentralize it,\u201d said Tamas, who doesn\u2019t worry about criminals and terrorists using the decentralized Internet to evade justice. \u201cThey don't really need ZeroNet, since they can already create hidden websites using only Tor,\u201d he said.\nTamas explained how ZeroNet sites are updated. \u201cIf you want to publish an update you have to sign it, then send it to some peers, and they will distribute it to other peers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe signing/publish API methods are hidden under the hood, and handled by the site's JavaScript source code. Every site is updated in real-time. When new or updated content is received by the client (e.g. a comment), the client informs the browser and the browser displays the update.\u201d\nTamas is aware of other projects to implement a decentralized web, but he emphasizes that ZeroNet has unique features: \u201cProject Maelstrom does not allow to create dynamic or multi-user websites, and it's not open-source,\u201d he noted. \u201cMaidSafe --as far as I know --is more focused on file storage.\u201d\nNow that the TorrentFreak article on the Play torrent site is catapulting ZeroNet to public attention, BitTorrent users wonder whether Play could scale up and become a mega torrent site like The Pirate Bay. Tamas explained that at this moment there are some technical limitations. \u201cBy default there is a 10-megabyte space limit per website, which should be enough to store 6-80,000 torrents,\u201d he said. \u201cSo ZeroNet currently is better suited for smaller sites, but there will be improvement on this. ZeroNet is most suitable for personal blogs/forums, and a Twitter-like social site is planned for release in the next few months.\u201d\nTamas, who currently is the only developer of ZeroNet, appreciates donations but has no immediate monetization plans and no long-term roadmap. He explained that ZeroNet is developed with a \"content first\" approach. \u201cI create new ZeroNet sites, and develop the new core features needed for the new sites,\u201d he said, and added that he is considering adding Bitcoin integration to the core software for a new ZeroNet marketplace website. \u00a0\nAt this moment, ZeroNet has an integrated Bitcoin address. From the ZeroNet FAQ: \"Can I use the generated site address/private key to accept Bitcoin payments? Yes, it's a standard Bitcoin address. The private key is WIF formatted, so you can import it in most clients.\"\nTamas emphasized that ZeroNet uses exactly the same cryptography as Bitcoin, which could enable future Bitcoin integration. \u201cIt's possible to send Bitcoin to a site's address, but currently to do that you need to use an external Bitcoin wallet,\u201d he said. \u201cLater we can have this built-in, so you can follow your transactions and send Bitcoins directly using the web interface.\u201d\n\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 4}

Ethereum is a well-known open source technology in this space and we also look forward to collaborative experiments using other technologies,\u201d stated Barclays Investment Bank CTO Brad Novak.\nUnlike Bitcoin however, the unique blockchain network of R3 offers tokenized assets as the unified store of value, enabling banks to implement its existing fiat-based banking processes onto the network.\nUsing the Ethereum technology, banks will also attempt to process the transfer of assets and shares without cost across the banking systems of the connected banks.\n\u201cThe transition from vision and hypothesis to application and execution signifies the next major step towards using this technology to transform how institutions interact, report and trade with each other in financial markets,\" Novak said.\n\"This is a very exciting development, both for R3 and our member banks, as well as the global financial services industry as a whole,\u201d said R3 CEO David Rutter.\nOne key limitation of the R3 blockchain network is its centralization. The R3 consortium states that the blockchain they have built and are operating is private among banking groups and financial institutions.\nThe concept of a blockchain network, introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, describes a peer-to-peer technological protocol in which users can transact or settle assets to each other, in a trustless environment. However, because the blockchain technology of R3 consortium depends on the technical rules and regulations set by a central authority, the technology of R3 does not qualify as a trustless technology, like the Bitcoin network.\nThus, the development of the R3 blockchain technology defies the concept of a blockchain technology introduced in the Bitcoin white paper drafted by Nakamoto eight years ago.\nAdditionally, the security of a blockchain network depends on the computing power that is being contributed to secure and confirm transactions. The Bitcoin network for example, is considered to be an unbreakable technology because of the magnitude of computing power provided by millions of miners and leading mining firms worldwide.\nSince the R3 blockchain network is maintained by its member banks, the \u201cpermissioned\u201d blockchain technology of the consortium has substantially lower security levels and consumer benefit.\nDespite the limitations of the technology, R3 CEO Rutter still believes that its bank-based blockchain network could benefit global financial markets and reduce the costs of banks globally.\n\u201cThe addition of this new group of banks demonstrates widespread support for innovative distributed ledger solutions across the global financial services community, and we\u2019re delighted to have them on board,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have placed an emphasis on working with the market from day one, and our partners recognize that a collaborative model is the best way to quickly, efficiently and cost-effectively deliver these new technologies to global financial markets.\u201d\nCurrently, only 11 banks have joined the network designed by the R3 consortium. Over the next few months, more financial institutions in the consortium could potentially embrace the technology and integrate it to their existing financial systems.\nInterestingly, the growing usage of the Ethereum network in the development of permissioned blockchains led by the world\u2019s largest financial establishments and multi-billion dollar banks has surged the value of the Ethereum network and its cryptocurrency Ether, which is now worth USD $715 million, nearly 11.1 percent of the market cap of Bitcoin.\nThe demand for Ethereum has also explosively increased on cryptocurrency trading platforms such as ShapeShift and Poloniex.

After meeting for more than 18 hours, they released a statement with agreement on several points about the debate.\nAmong the group releasing the statement were the founding team of AntPool, A-XBT, BitFury, Bitmain, \u00a0BTCC, F2Pool, Genesis Mining and GHash.io. These mining executives represent more than 80 percent of total blocks mined in recent months, according to Blockchain.info. Bitcoin Core developers\u00a0also joining in the group statement\u00a0were\u00a0Cory Fields, Johnson Lau, Luke Dashjr, Matt Corallo and Peter Todd.\nThe group\u00a0announced that Segregated Witness (SegWit), a proposed change in Bitcoin\u2019s code that changes the way that data from Bitcoin transaction signatures are stored, will continue to be developed and released in the next two months. SegWit has received a positive reaction from members of the Bitcoin community after being presented by Dr. Pieter Wuille, Bitcoin Core developer and one of the founders of Blockstream, at the Scaling Bitcoin conference in Hong Kong three months ago.\nIn addition, the statement said that \u201c[Core developers] will continue to work with the entire Bitcoin protocol development community to develop, in public, a safe hard-fork based on the improvements in SegWit \u2026 as a recommendation to Bitcoin Core within three months after the release of SegWit.\u201d\nThe statement continues:\n\u201cThis hard-fork is expected to include features which are currently being discussed within technical communities, including an increase in the non-witness data to be around 2 MB, with the total size no more than 4 MB, and will only be adopted with broad support across the entire Bitcoin community.\u201d\nIf the rest of the Bitcoin Core team approves\u00a0the changes and there is strong consensus\u00a0from the community, it will support the implementation of a hard fork. This will require everyone running a full node\u00a0to download the new software in order to stay compatible with the network. The statement predicts the hard fork\u00a0will likely not be activated\u00a0until July 2017.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 3}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nElectrum, Bitcoin's popular lightweight wallet, launched a new version of its software this week. Apart from a desktop client, Electrum 2.6 is now\u00a0available on Android as well, with an iOS version soon to come.\nAt its heart, the mobile version of Electrum is no different from the available desktop version. The two are fully compatible as well; if the seed from one wallet is imported onto the other, all funds and transactions are synchronized. As such, users don't need to maintain two different balances on their desktop and mobile devices.\n\u201cThe main difference between existing Electrum wallets and the mobile version is the user interface,\u201d Electrum developer Thomas Voegtlin explained. \u201cThe look and feel is very different of course, I basically had to redesign that part from scratch. Compared to the desktop version, the mobile wallet is generally easier to use, and built around payment requests in particular \u2013 both incoming and outgoing. I've also added some extra tricks, like the option to use a second phone to create a completely safe cold storage device to sign transactions. And users will be able to buy and sell Bitcoin directly from the app later this year.\u201d\nElectrum offers a unique hybrid security model, that combines indexing the blockchain with\u00a0Simple Payment Verification (SPV). The wallet retrieves its transaction history and balance from a single Electrum server, while it connects to a number of additional servers to fetch block headers and verify that transactions reported by the first server are really included in the blockchain. Private keys are generated on the client side, and are always controlled by the user.\nVoegtlin said he believes his wallet offers a much-needed move away from centralized solutions, benefiting decentralization and the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole.\n\u201cMost mobile users currently rely on wallet applications that trust centralized servers, often hosted by companies,\u201d Voegtlin explained. \u201cThat offers very little security. In the worst case, users do not have control over their private keys, and the companies providing these apps can block transactions or even confiscate funds. Either intentionally, for example in order to comply with regulations, or unintentionally: their server could be hacked by a malicious employee or otherwise compromised. In the best case, the user controls his private keys, but still trusts a server for his balance and status. This means that whoever compromises the server can poison a user's wallet with fake transactions, for example, by falsely making them believe they received Bitcoin. And of course, these wallets offer very little privacy.\u201d\nHe added:\n\u201cElectrum is based on open\u00a0source software, and users control their own money. The wallet is also faster than other SPV-wallets, which need to scan the blockchain, and offers more privacy since the list of wallet addresses are not sent over the Bitcoin network.\u201d\nWhile reliable user statistics are typically not easy to get in the open source and privacy aware Bitcoin space, it's safe to say that Electrum is one of the most used \u2013 if not the most used \u2013 software wallets available. Extrapolating data from his own Electrum server, Voegtlin estimates that some 10 percent of all transactions on the network are sent with the open-source software wallet.\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 4}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nBitcoin Core\u00a0contributor\u00a0Peter Todd\u00a0was\u00a0recently interviewed on episode 34\u00a0ofThe Bitcoin Game, and the longtime Bitcoin developer and researcher was able to explain some of the key disagreements between how the\u00a0Bitcoin Classic\u00a0and Bitcoin Core teams view the peer-to-peer digital cash system.\nWhile many view the Classic vs. Core controversy as nothing more than a technical debate, the reality is both camps seem to have rather different fundamental plans for the future of Bitcoin. During his recent interview, Todd noted:\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve got a group of developers with a very different view of how Bitcoin works and what the goals of the projects are. I think that\u2019s inevitably going to lead to a lot of friction.\u201d\nThe current climate in the Bitcoin community is extremely contentious, and the differing philosophical views in the Classic and Core camps are at the root of all the controversy. When asked directly about the key differences between Bitcoin Core and Classic\u2019s alternative implementation, Todd was able to provide four specific examples of where the two sides do not see eye-to-eye.\u00a0\n1. Balancing Decentralization and Efficiency\nFor most, the crux of the Classic vs. Core debate is decentralization vs. efficiency. The Classic team is more willing to increase the\u00a0system resource\u00a0requirements for operating a\u00a0full node, while the Core team wants to keep the barriers to running a full node as low as possible.\nDuring Todd\u2019s interview, he often used Bitcoin Classic Developer\u00a0Gavin Andresenas an example of someone who opposes Core\u2019s main viewpoints. Todd stated:\n\u201c[Gavin] expects people to go make that tradeoff where, in exchange for having a system that\u2019s cheaper, you have a system that\u2019s more centralized.\u201d\nTodd also pointed out that Andresen has claimed early adopters may be upset with what Bitcoin eventually becomes.\nIt should be noted that many on the Classic side of the debate would say that their view on how Bitcoin should work would actually be better for decentralization over the long term, but this gets into the next area of contention between the two sides.\n2. Keeping Bitcoin\u2019s Base Layer Decentralized\nTodd\u2019s first two points are closely connected. Todd all but admits that the real debate is more about how decentralization is achieved rather than which side is necessarily in favor of more decentralization.\nThe longtime Bitcoin researcher explained Bitcoin Core\u2019s side of the argument:\n\u201cI think the real difference is that the Bitcoin Core developers--they understand that these tradeoffs are going to happen, at least with current technology--are willing to put the tradeoffs in different places. I would much rather have the tradeoff be that the Bitcoin blockchain layer--the very lowest level--stays highly decentralized. It may get more expensive to use directly, but you counterbalance that by putting the inevitable centralization at a higher level.\u201d\nOther supporters of the Bitcoin Core ethos often say they would prefer to build a centralized layer on top of a decentralized base because you cannot build a decentralized layer on top of a centralized layer. In the past, Bitcoin Core Contributor\u00a0Eric Lombrozo\u00a0has\u00a0explained\u00a0the need for multiple protocol layers for Bitcoin.\nWhile centralized layers for\u00a0off-chain\u00a0Bitcoin transactions already exist (think Circle, Coinbase or any Bitcoin exchange), Bitcoin Core hopes less-centralized systems, such as the\u00a0Lightning Network, can eventually offer an acceptable tradeoff. Nodes on the Lightning Network are trusted more than Bitcoin miners, but they\u2019re unable to steal funds from users. The system essentially extends the Bitcoin blockchain for fast micropayments through the use of smart contracts.\nFormer\u00a0Bitcoin XT\u00a0Developer\u00a0Mike Hearn\u00a0and\u00a0OpenBazaar\u00a0Developer\u00a0Chris Pacia\u00a0both\u00a0have writtenblog posts about the Lightning Network with skeptical slants. One of the main criticisms from Classic supporters is that the hubs on the Lightning Network will become too centralized and easy targets for governments as a method to censor transactions.\nWhether this will become an issue in the real world is an unknown, but Lightning Network developers are\u00a0working on Tor-style onion routing features\u00a0for the system. The developers behind this possible extension of the Bitcoin blockchain understand the importance of protecting privacy at all costs.\n3. What Is Classic\u2019s Long-Term Plan?\nAccording to Todd, Bitcoin Classic needs to explain how it will scale the Bitcoin blockchain if it\u00a0does not view\u00a0the Lightning Network as a potential option.\nHe noted:\n\u201cI\u2019m just not seeing acceptance from the Classic team that there are limits to the system, and we can\u2019t scale up [via a block size limit increase] indefinitely, so what\u2019s your long-term plan?\u201d\nAfter referencing a statement by Gavin Andresen that Bitcoin may need another hard fork roughly 12 months after Bitcoin Classic\u2019s first potential hard fork, Todd added:\n\u201cI think Bitcoin Core has been more focused on enabling solutions that fit on top of the Bitcoin layer, so we don\u2019t have to make that hard trade--a hard decision, yet again, in another 12 months.\u201d\nIn other words, Bitcoin Core sees the need for something like the Lightning Network for Bitcoin to scale, and simple block size limit increases are not going to cut it over the long term. Bitcoin Core sees the Lightning Network (or some other off-chain protocol) as the best path forward because it does not believe the system can scale with too many transactions on the blockchain. A key side debate here between the two camps is whether the Bitcoin blockchain should be viewed as a settlement layer.\n4. Accepting the Realities of Bitcoin Scalability\nThe vast majority of Bitcoin Core developers and contributors\u00a0view Bitcoin as a settlement layer\u00a0because they accept the fact that the system in its current form cannot scale to mainstream levels of adoption. Todd explained what he seemed to view as this harsh reality during the interview:\n\u201cThe system doesn\u2019t scale, and you just have to accept that and do something smarter. Every time you do a [block size limit] increase, you\u2019re making the system more centralized.\u201d\nThese two projects simply have two completely different viewpoints on how Bitcoin should work, which means it should be no surprise that the entire community is somewhat split at the moment.\nTodd added:\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily one\u2019s right and one\u2019s wrong, but [Gavin] is not interested in designing the same system I\u2019m interested in designing.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 4}

BitGo and HYPR share a common view of the importance of decentralized security protocols. I cannot imagine a better team to partner with,\u201d said George Avetisov, CEO of HYPR Corp.\nTalking to Planet Biometrics, George Avetisov, CEO and co-founder, HYPR, said that the integration of decentralized biometric authentication with blockchain will address the issue of security and usability associated with digital assets, and increase its adoption.\n\u201cTwo of the key issues that have hindered adoption of digital assets are security and usability. Decentralized biometric authentication addresses both issues as it manages to drastically increase security while also improving usability.\u201d Avetisov told Planet Biometrics. \nThis partnership will also provide an integrated solution to financial institutions looking to adopt blockchain/biometric security technology. \u00a0The partnership will also see the adoption of Fast Identity Online (FIDO) security standards, bolstering a digital currency giant\u2019s push toward the FIDO protocol.\nTalking about how financial institutions and enterprises can prevent data breaches, Avetisov said that HYPR\u2019s decentralized biometric authentication system does not store a user\u2019s biometric credential on a central server. Instead, the storage and encryption of biometric credentials is distributed across all devices, hence it is hacker-proof and secure.\n\u201cBy decentralizing the biometric data across millions of devices, encrypting it and tokenizing their use at the time of account access, there are multiple benefits,\u201d Avetisov told Planet Biometrics. \u201cThe end user is protected, the enterprise deploying the application has lower risk and the UX is superior to passwords. Users are also protected against device loss through revocability, as the enterprise simply disables the public keys used to respond to the authentication in the event of a lost device.\u201d\nAccording to figures provided by the company, BitGo processes around 10,000 transactions on any given day and secures more than $1 billion per month in digital assets.\n\u201cAll of our customers are asking how to use biometric security to protect their digital assets,\u201d said Mike Belshe, CEO of BitGo. \u201cThe HYPR team has been laser-focused on this and provides a great solution for us.\u201d\nBesides partnering with BitGo, HYPR launched a HYPR-Secure partner program that invites vendors to augment the security of their technologies through its platform.

Aiming to unlock untapped potential donations, which are estimated to be between $4 billion and\u00a0$8 billion, Helperbit uses a fast and transparent P2P donation system. It is through this system that donors and those affected by natural disasters are put into direct contact, avoiding the middleman.\nCo-founders of Helperbit, Guido Baroncini Turricchia, Davide Gessa, Davide Menegaldo, Roberto Tudini, Vincenzo Agu\u00ec\u00a0and Gianluca Carbone, initially came up with the idea after reading news about the misuse of funds after the 2009 L\u2019Aquila earthquake in Italy. In 2012, the Italian il Fatto Quotidiano reported that the five million euros donated by Italians to help with building reconstruction was still sitting in banks, which saw the donations transferred to a guarantee fund blocked for nine years, meaning the five million earthquake victims ended up not seeing a penny.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Guido Baroncini Turricchia\u00a0said:\n\u201cMany of the problems related to the redistribution of donations would be softened if the money flow was visible on the blockchain public ledger. After some research, we found that many people avoid donating not only due to a lack of transparency, but also because of the delay, inefficiency and the arbitrary redistribution of funds. It was clear that all these issues would have been solved if a system gave more control and transparency to the user.\u201d\nEnter Helperbit, the system that the creators believe will help revolutionize the way people donate in the future.\n\u201cAt the moment all charity systems are based on fiat money, but the revolution needs a cultural change,\u201d said Turricchia. \u201cOur effort is just a brick of a wider transparency revolution that in future will probably expand to the public sector with many advantages for citizens.\u201d\nOf course, to say that the system will be easy or fast to set up is an understatement. If, for instance, an individual wanted to donate to a specific event, but there were two similar organizations, and only one offered an internal audit based on an open blockchain ledger, it would be surprising if that individual decided to go with the charity that didn\u2019t give the option of seeing where the donor\u2019s money was going.\n\u201cThere is no traditional charity system at the moment that offers an economic audit on a public ledger,\u201d said Turricchia. \u201cWe will give the opportunity to decide who receives the donation, such as a single user or organization, using a geographic approach.\u201d\nDaily news is filled with natural disasters taking place across the world, along with organizations calling for donations. As in the case of the L'Aquila earthquake, it often seems that aid for the people who need it most travels at a slow speed and in many cases might not reach them at all.\u00a0\nWith Helperbit, donors would have more control over where their money ends up. Helperbit\u00a0would deliver a fast and advanced way to proceed through the donation process that is constantly improved through user\u00a0feedback. It would be so fast that Bitcoin donations could be available in as little as 10 minutes.\nThe impact this will have on natural disaster areas will be to get help more quickly to those in need, without the hindrance of bureaucratic processes.\n\u201cEvery time a catastrophic event happens, there will be a worldwide collaboration to economically mitigate the risen issues,\u201d said Turricchia. \u201cThanks to Bitcoin, humanity finally has the opportunity to work as a single entity to cure itself.\u201d\n\u201cBlockchain and math-based currency can help to refresh the [charitable donation] environment, offering to donors and organizations a higher level of trust,\u201d he said.\nIn order to give users the best information available, the system will automatically update itself on natural disasters, giving donors clear information about who is receiving their money. Once a donor has signed up to Helperbit, he or she will be able to see a complete view of who is involved in a specific event, with the option to either donate according to the proposed algorithm or to change to a different cause.\nThe Helperbit system runs on a freemium service and offers two main levels to donors. The first level, which is the P2P Bitcoin donation system, is free with a suggested donation to support Helperbit. At this level, after a natural disaster, donors can make a voluntary donation where the quantity of the donation is not fixed and depends on what donors want to give to a specific cause. However, in order to receive additional benefits, such as more visibility to local institutions or insurance against natural disasters, a donor is asked to make a specific paid contribution for participation in Helperbit's second level.\nHelperbit is currently in the early stages of development; however, those who subscribe to the website will have the opportunity to participate in the private beta where they can impart their advice on what works and what doesn\u2019t.\n\u201cAfter fine-tuning based on users\u2019 advice, we will go live with the first basic features,\u201d said Turricchia. \u201cThen, every couple of months we will add further features, different methods of payment, and more user interactions.\u201d\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 7}

She began by reframing how our current economy is governed.\n\"We live in a technocracy, where every value is up for grabs.\" -@LatanyaSweeney\nShe went on to describe how racism has pervaded current technologies. For example, on Google, according to her recent paper, a black-identifying name was 25 percent more likely to get an ad suggestive of an arrest record. She stated that\u00a0The Princeton Review, which offers standardized testing preparation for students, increased prices by 180 percent on average for people living in primarily Asian neighborhoods, and that\u00a0Asian Airbnb hosts earn 20 percent less than Caucasion hosts when listing their homes.

He also announced Blockchain Madness, an inter-campus trivia contest between teams from MIT, NYU, Concordia University and others that will take place this March.\nMasley was followed by Dominik Schlener, who discussed the concept and implementation of PublicVotes, a voting platform he built with Ethereum that could help countries save as much as 99.78 percent of the costs associated with counting and collecting ballots. Michael Gord,\u00a0founder of the McGill University Bitcoin Club, followed to talk about his experience hosting the McGill Bitcoin Airdrop, where students each received USD $10 in Bitcoin free, in exchange for helping to increase user adoption.\nLater in the afternoon, Enigma co-founder Guy Zyskind took the stage to explain the backend behind his technology, which utilizes a large decentralized network of computers that enables users to query and compute with data that remains encrypted throughout the entire process. By splitting a large, encrypted dataset into smaller packets and only compiling the final decrypted query together on the client\u2019s computer, Enigma is bringing theoretical distributed computing to reality using blockchain as the backend.\nThe afternoon was comprised of a discussion about increasing the block size, limitations of blockchain-based voting and approaches to identity verification on the blockchain from Netki CEO Justin Newton.\nFormer MIT Bitcoin Club executive director Jeremy Rubin closed the conference with macroeconomic theory and how it relates to the current state of the Bitcoin community.\n\"We shouldn't treat these community debates as battles to win, but rather as competitions to be proud of.\" -@JeremyRubin\nSet overlooking the Charles River, the third annual MIT Bitcoin Expo brought together developers, founders and students to discuss both technical issues and potential solutions in today\u2019s polarized climate.\nWhen asked about the conference, current MIT Bitcoin Club executive director Nchinda Nchinda simply stated, \u201cWe're going to make blockchain great again.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 6}

The fund, to be called Logos Fund, has officially filed its Form D with the SEC. According to the fund\u2019s website, the fund will also allow investors to gain exposure to bitcoins directly (in addition to Bitcoin mining operations).\nWhy Start a Bitcoin Mining Fund?\nAccording to Genesis Mining, the company has received more than $100 million in inquiries involving Bitcoin mining over the past two years. While many Bitcoin enthusiasts have purchased their own equipment and started their own mining operations in recent years, the reality is that this process is not attractive to many professional investors.\nThe Logos Fund is intended to be a professional investment vehicle targeted at high net worth clients. More specifically, Genesis Mining CEO and co-founder Marco Streng told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cThe fund will be accessible on request for accredited investors.\nInvestors can receive more detailed and individual information by just contacting us [directly].\u201d\n\u201cWhen you receive $100 million worth of inquiries from big-time investors looking to enter the market, you\u2019d be foolish not to listen and build a solution,\u201d Streng said.\nIn terms of what types of investments will be made by the fund, Streng told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cWe think mining is a huge opportunity for large-scale investors and we are bullish on the future value of Bitcoin. Our initial strategy will be to generate bitcoins for our investors for the lowest price possible, giving them access to what we feel is the most exciting investment class that has existed in decades.\u201d\nManagement of the Logos Fund\nBj\u00f6rn Tilmann Arzt and Dr. Florian Putzka are currently listed as the two managers of the fund. Arzt has worked with Genesis Mining and as a structurer for a major European investment bank. Putzka\u2019s experience is as a qualified German legal counsel specializing in contract and bank law.\nGenesis Mining will be providing $1 million of its own capital to the Logos Fund. When asked what this initial capital would be used for, Streng told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cAll capital will be invested in mining infrastructure and further developing its operability and production capacity in advance of outside investors joining the fund.\u201d\nStreng added, \u201cAt this stage, most of the investments will be in Genesis Mining operations due to our ability to get the lowest priced electricity and hardware, giving our investors the most efficient mining operations that exist.\u201d\nUnregulated Bitcoin Mining Funds Have Existed Before\nAlthough the Logos Fund will be the first legal, regulated Bitcoin mining fund, there were also a few funds offering exposure to the Bitcoin mining industry in the early days of bitcointalk.org. MiningCo.ETF was a fund traded on the now-defunct BTC-TC and BitFunder exchanges. Carnth, the creator of the fund, described it as a way to \u201callow investors to instantly diversify among higher quality mining assets.\u201d\nThere was a large amount of financial experimentation in the early days of Bitcoin. Some of these activities were nothing more than scams and Ponzi schemes, while others, such as MiningCo.ETC, were well-intentioned products, which could possibly be viewed as precursors to some of the new investment vehicles seen in the space today.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 8}
{"title": "The Case for Replace-By-Fee (And the Case Against)", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/the-case-for-replace-by-fee-and-the-case-against-1457383308/", "birthday": "Mar 7, 2016  3:41 PM EST", "date": "2016-03-07 20:41:00", "content": "Aaron van Wirdum is interested in decentralized consensus, FOSS, privacy in the digital age, censorship resistant payments, and more of that stereotypical Bitcoin stuff. Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe heated debate in the Bitcoin community throughout the past months not only concerns the block size dispute. Another technical change at the center of conflict is replace-by-fee, a version of which was included in the latest release of Bitcoin Core \u2013 while the next version of Bitcoin Classic will have no replace-by-fee at all.\nAn often-heard criticism against replace-by-fee is that it creates new problems while it doesn't really solve any existing ones. But that criticism is questionable.\nBelow is the case for replace-by-fee. (And the case against.)\nReplace-by-Fee Explained\nWhat is replace-by-fee?\nReplace-by-fee is a mempool policy. Mempools are collections of unconfirmed transactions stored by full nodes, and are used by miners to select transactions to include in blocks.\nFor the past years, most nodes on the Bitcoin network applied a \u201cfirst-seen\u201d mempool policy. If a node received two conflicting transactions (spending the same inputs) the latest was always rejected.\nReplace-by-fee, as the name suggests, instead allows transactions in the mempool to be replaced by newer transactions, if they include a higher fee.\nThere are some variants of replace-by-fee as well, including the one adopted by Bitcoin Core. But we\u2019ll get to that in a bit.\nThe Case Against Replace-by-Fee\nWhat\u2019s the problem with replace-by-fee?\nBasically, replace-by-fee enables users to easily double-spend unconfirmed transactions. Someone could \u2013 for instance \u2013 make a purchase with bitcoins, but quickly afterward send these same bitcoins back to himself.\nPerhaps most important, replace-by-fee could disadvantage Bitcoin payment processors that effectively built (a part of) their business on instant payments. Merchants selling digital goods, and merchants selling physical goods from brick-and-mortar stores, could be negatively affected as well; it's impractical to have customers wait several minutes for a confirmation. And if services stop accepting (unconfirmed) Bitcoin transactions because of this, their customers would arguably be disadvantaged, too.\nAn additional detriment of replace-by-fee might be the added complexity it introduces. Wallet software may require additions that confuse regular users, and \u2013 like any other software extension \u2013 there\u2019s always a small risk that badly implemented code could introduce new bugs or other weaknesses.\nUnconfirmed Transactions\nNow, given these obvious detriments, why is this feature even considered at all?\nPerhaps the most common argument in defense of replace-by-fee is a simple one: Unconfirmed transactions were never secure, and it was always unwise to rely on them.\nWhile it\u2019s probably true that replace-by-fee would make it easier and cheaper for most people to double-spend a transaction right now, it is already very easy and cheap for those who know what they\u2019re doing.\nTricks to double-spend can be as trivial as sending a first transaction with a low enough fee to be rejected by most miners, followed by a conflicting transaction with sufficient fee. There is even a publicly available script that automates this, which has proved quite successful.\nMeanwhile, more advanced solutions \u2013 including payment channels, sidechains, multisig solutions and the Lightning Network or similar solutions \u2013 actually can offer instantly secure Bitcoin transactions, regardless of replace-by-fee. Though, of course, not all of these are rolled out yet.\n\u2018Un-stuck\u2019 Transactions\nWhat is perhaps more important is: Replace-by-fee solves real problems.\nVery relevant in light of recent events, replace-by-fee can be used to get transactions \u201cun-stuck.\u201d\nAs traffic on the Bitcoin network continues to increase \u2013 either legitimately or through \u201cspam\u201d attacks \u2013 not all transactions are included in blocks, or it can take a long time. While this is not new and has occurred before, a sudden surge in transaction volume last week highlighted the problem.\nAnd what\u2019s more, if miners apply a first-seen policy, it means that transactions paying low fees can get stuck in miners\u2019 mempools. This leaves the transaction (and the bitcoins involved) in limbo. It typically takes up to several days before miners drop these transactions from their mempools, and users can try again. This sort of unreliability was cause for many complaints last week, and even significant negative media coverage.\nThat\u2019s where replace-by-fee comes in. With replace-by-fee, the \u201cstuck\u201d transaction can be replaced immediately by a conflicting transaction including more fees, getting the bitcoins un-stuck whenever the user wants them. Replace-by-fee could solve one of the main problems of Bitcoin blocks filling up right now.\nAnd while another trick \u2013 Child Pays For Parent \u2013 could solve similar problems by \u201clinking\u201d newer transactions to unconfirmed transactions, replace-by-fee does it more efficiently and therefore cheaper. Child Pays For Parent is also not included in Bitcoin Core yet, nor in Bitcoin Classic. And while hard to know for sure, most miners are almost certainly not applying it either.\nFee Market\nOverlapping with the previous argument, replace-by-fee could be useful to establish a competitive fee market.\nAs the block reward diminishes over time to eventually reach zero, miners will need to earn an income through fees in some form. If they don't, they have no incentive to secure the network. (Or the Bitcoin protocol will require some kind of radical redesign.)\nThis could be realized through an auction-style fee market, where users bid for the scarce space in blocks. But that presents a new problem: if it\u2019s not really clear to users how much fee to include, they could easily pay too much. (Or too little, as shown above.)\nThis problem could be solved with replace-by-fee, combined with wallet software that keeps track of network activity to calculate optimal fees. This combination would allow users to spend the minimum possible fee per transaction, and automatically re-send the transactions with an increased fee when needed. This could smooth the transaction process, and improve the user experience.\nThat said, not everyone supports the establishment of these types of fee markets, or not yet. As such, not everyone agrees improving such markets should be considered a benefit yet. But discussing the desirability of these fee markets is beyond the scope of this article.\nAdded Efficiency\nNext, replace-by-fee can increase efficiency on Bitcoin network.\nReplace-by-fee effectively allows users to combine several transactions into one. For instance, if a user sends a payment to one merchant, and wants to pay another merchant shortly after, he can replace the original transaction to create a single transaction that pays both. The single transaction would require less block space, and the sender can pay a lower total fee.\nA similar trick could be useful if the sender wants to increase the size of the original transaction, for instance because he decides to buy an extra product from the same merchant shortly after his first purchase.\nAdditionally, replace-by-fee could allow for the implementation of even more advanced optimization schemes and certain smart contract solutions.\nAnd of course, all of this could be fully automated by wallet software.\n\u2018First-Seen-Safe Replace-by-Fee'\nThen, the case against replace-by-fee doesn't always hold up to the same extent in the first place.\nA variation where the argument against replace-by-fee hardly holds up at all, is first-seen-safe replace-by-fee.\nFirst-seen-safe replace-by-fee allows transactions to be replaced only if they send at least the same amount of bitcoins to the same outputs. As such, the person on the receiving end of the transaction is guaranteed his bitcoins or more \u2013 unless rejected for unrelated reasons.\nHowever, the argument for added efficiency does not always hold up for first-seen-safe replace-by-fee, since existing transactions cannot be extended.\nAnd even with first-seen-safe replace-by-fee, there are some risks where unconfirmed opt-in replace-by-fee transactions rely on other unconfirmed opt-in replace-by-fee transactions. But any attacker willing to put in this much effort to double-spend a transaction probably has easier options available. (Additionally, wallet software could potentially warn users when such transactions are incoming.)\n'Opt-in Replace-by-Fee'\nBitcoin Core 0.12.0 included a variation of replace-by-fee called opt-in replace-by-fee.\nOpt-in replace-by-fee allows transactions to be replaced only if they are flagged as such by the sender. And since this flag should be visible to the receiving end of the transaction as well, the receiver can choose whether he wants to accept the transaction while still unconfirmed.\nIf the receiver does not want to accept the unconfirmed transaction, he can request a new transaction to overwrite the old one, but without replace-by-fee enabled. Or he can wait for a confirmation.\nBitcoin software will need to adapt to actually warn the user of an opt-in replace-by-fee transaction for this argument to hold up, of course. Not all wallets do this yet. (These wallets typically don\u2019t warn users about any double-spends at all.)\nThough, for companies that rely on unconfirmed transactions, the change should be trivial. BitPay CEO Stephen Pair, for one, endorsed opt-in replace-by-fee.\nAnd it should be noted that the risks where unconfirmed transactions rely on other unconfirmed transactions apply to the opt-in variation as well \u2013 as does the potential solution.\n\u2018Full\u2019 Replace-by-Fee\nYet some would prefer adoption of \u201cfull\u201d replace-by-fee: replace-by-fee without restrictions, as described at the beginning of this article.\nFull replace-by-fee offers one particular benefit over the other variants: it could prevent what Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd has described as a type of 'Sybil attack' on the Bitcoin network.\nAs mentioned, unconfirmed transactions are currently unsafe \u2013 with or without replace-by-fee. To mitigate the risks involved, companies can connect to the Bitcoin network through nodes all across the world; a method employed already. This allows them to monitor for conflicting transactions anywhere on the network.\nBut this type of monitoring could introduce two problems. First, the infrastructure required to pull this off provides companies with data suggesting where transactions originated. And this data could also help de-anonymize Bitcoin users.\nSecond, this type of monitoring presents a load on Bitcoin's infrastructure. Requesting transaction data requires bandwidth and connection slots from nodes; two scarce network resources. And because this type of analysis occupies a fixed share of these resources, only so many companies could do so before all nodes are maxed out. In a worst-case scenario, Todd warns, this could disrupt or even collapse the network.\nFull replace-by-fee renders this type of monitoring almost completely moot. If transactions are trivially replaced, there is no point in monitoring the network for double-spends in the first place.\nReplace-by-Fee Is No Consensus Rule\nLastly, it should be emphasized that replace-by-fee is not a consensus rule; none of the variants really require consensus on the Bitcoin network.\nWallet software allows users to double-spend transactions \u2013 or not. Nodes on the network pick which transactions to forward, but a tiny minority can enable any type of replace-by-fee policy available.\nIt\u2019s miners that ultimately decide which transactions they include in blocks. They determine whether any replace-by-fee policies are in use.\nThanks for initial proofreading and added suggestions go out to Peter Todd and Elliot Olds.\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 7}

The attacker froze the hospital\u2019s computer systems for 10 days and demanded 40 bitcoins, about $17,000, to restore service. The brazen attack and the hospital\u2019s decision to pay the ransom has renewed the debate about the criminal uses of Bitcoin.\u00a0\nChainalysis\u2019 blockchain analytics technology enables law enforcement agencies to track such ransom payments through the Bitcoin blockchain, and eventually to identify the culprits.\u00a0\nLaw enforcement agencies are not the only ones interested in blockchain analytics. Chainalysis recently contracted with Barclays to provide compliance tools that will allow the London-based bank to work with businesses that operate on the Bitcoin blockchain.\u00a0\nMany banks are prevented from providing services to businesses that accept Bitcoin because the pseudo-anonymous nature of the virtual currency keeps banks from complying with anti-money laundering regulations. Chainalysis gathers and analyses data from the blockchain so that banks can meet their regulatory reporting requirements to ensure that they are not facilitating money laundering or other criminal activities.\u00a0\nChainalysis is a big player in the fast-emerging blockchain analytics industry. Major rivals include Coinanalytics, Blockseer, Elliptic and Scorechain, which also offer compliance tools for banks and investigative tools for law enforcement agencies.\u00a0\nHow the advent of Chainalysis and other blockchain analytics companies will affect the perception of Bitcoin among advocates and users of the virtual currency remains to be seen. If Bitcoin transactions can be tracked and traced as easily as bank transfers, the virtual currency risks losing its appeal with both the criminal underworld and its privacy-minded pioneers.\nChainalysis\u2019 stated goal is to \u201cmove digital currencies out of the hands of the criminals and into the hands of consumers and \u2026 commerce.\u201d That transition, however, may be opposed not just by criminals but also by law-abiding users of Bitcoin, and by the developers of the virtual currency themselves.\u00a0\nLast March, Chainalysis\u2019 CEO Michael Gr\u00f8nager responded to allegations from three Bitcoin Core developers that his company had launched a so-called \u201cSybil attack\u201d against the Bitcoin network. Wladimir van der Laan, Peter Todd and Gregory Maxwell accused Chainalysis of creating more than 250 fake nodes on the Bitcoin network in order to collect transaction location information.\u00a0\nA Sybil attack is when a single user creates multiple fake nodes on a peer-to-peer network. Chainalysis\u2019 fake nodes prevented users of some decentralized wallets such as Breadwallet from syncing with the Bitcoin network.\u00a0\nGr\u00f8nager admitted that Chainalysis created the fake nodes, but said that they were \u201ccarefully tailored\u201d not to interfere with the Bitcoin network, and that a Sybil attack was \u201cunintended.\u201d Chainalysis says it has since shut down the fake nodes.\u00a0\nIn response, Breadwallet blocked all IP addresses known to be associated with Chainalysis, and Mycelium, the blockchain payments company where Chainalysis\u2019 co-founder Jan M\u00f8ller previously worked as lead developer, quickly followed suit. In a lengthy post explaining the move, Mycelium\u2019s founder Dimitry Murashchik, aka Rassah, said that he and his team \u201care not fans of what Chainalysis does.\u201d\u00a0\nA company roadmap leaked in April 2015 reveals that Chainalysis intends to effectively de-anonymize the virtual currency, something which Mycelium and many others in the Bitcoin ecosystem adamantly oppose. In the effort to make Bitcoin more accessible to banks and law enforcement agencies, Chainalysis and other blockchain analytics companies have irked some diehard Bitcoin advocates and developers. \u00a0\nBut that has not stopped investors from piling on the cash. Chainalysis\u2019 agreement with Europol comes as the company finishes a $1.6 million round of funding led by Point Nine Capital, Techstars, Digital Currency Group, Funders Club and Converge Venture Partners.\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 23}

Until recently, the company had remained silent over allegations that it had kept upfront payments from customers\u2019 even when it failed to deliver the hardware and that it had been using customers\u2019 Bitcoin mining machines before shipping them.\nNow, though, after signing a court order on February 25, Butterfly Labs says it wants to set the record straight as it begins the long journey of getting the company back up and running.\n\u201cBefore the FTC came in we were a serious business [with] a very clear picture of where the business was going,\u201d Jeff Ownby, Butterfly Labs vice president of e-commerce and marketing told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe had a clear understanding of where the refunds were and the refund liability, [and] we had a clear understanding of the shipping liability that we had, [which] we were tracking very meticulously throughout.\u201d\nIt had previously been reported by Bitcoin Magazine that Butterfly Labs had reached an out-of-court settlement with the FTC amounting to $38.6 million.\nThat figure was incorrect, as the orders contain partially suspended monetary judgements.\nAgainst Butterfly Labs and co-founder Sonny Vleisides, there is a suspended judgment of $38,615,161. The judgement that Butterfly Labs has agreed to pay is $15,000 and Vleisides $4,000. The suspended judgement only becomes operative if the judgement figures placed against them are not paid. It was alleged that Darla Drake, Butterfly Labs general manager, used machines from the company to mine bitcoins, which caused her to receive a judgement of $135,878. This, however, would be suspended once she surrendered the cash value of the bitcoins the government says she attained.\nButterfly Labs has stated that the allegation that Drake used machines from the company or customers to mine bitcoins is wrong. The company went on to say that this was the smallest machine the company made and was given to Drake, as well as other customer service agents so they could become familiar with them, after the completed delivery of the 65-nm line of equipment as they were unshippable due to the fact that they were under performing. Butterfly Labs said that employees received these machines as gifts to understand how they worked.\n\u201cShe only mined a total of four bitcoins as at the time it was easier to mine,\u201d Ownby said. \u201cI have no idea why they came up with that amount, but she settled to get them out of our business, so we can try to fix this mess.\u201d\nThe settlement of $15,000 and $4,000 were agreed upon by both sides so that Butterfly Labs could end the case.\n\u201cThe company, with the FTC action, was decimated. This settlement was done to avoid any further legal action and to try and preserve any assets we had left,\u201d said Ownby. \u201cWe agreed to that settlement only because we didn\u2019t want to deal with this anymore. We were trying to look to the future, so that\u2019s why we agreed to it.\u201d\nNor is there any merit behind the allegation that the company spent millions on saunas and guns, he said.\n\u201cWe had a massage person come in every two weeks for the employees as an employee benefit,\u201d said Ownby. \u201cIt\u2019s these kind of things that get overblown that we kept getting hammered with, and it was ludicrous.\u201d\nAccording to the Federal Trade Commission, Butterfly Labs was taking orders and charging as much as $30,000 for specialized hardware, but very few orders were being shipped to customers. The FTC alleged that Butterfly Labs failed to disclose to customers that they were\u00a0\u201cusing the machines for themselves before delivering them,\u201d and \u201cfailed to deliver the computers until they were practically useless, or in many cases, did not provide the computers at all.\u201d\nButterfly Labs told Bitcoin Magazine that allegation was untrue, stating that all equipment needed to be tested before shipment in order to reduce the return rate if there was an issue with the hardware, thus taking away the customers\u2019 ability to mine Bitcoins.\n\u201cAll the equipment has to be tested, [which] made our return rate less than 5 percent, which is great,\u201d said Ownby. \u201cAny piece of electronic equipment that goes out the door is tested before it\u2019s shipped, and that\u2019s all we were doing. Burn testing typically took less than two hours and in rare cases as much as two days, if necessary. To say that we mined with customers\u2019 equipment is ludicrous.\u201d\nSo how did Butterfly Labs get itself into this situation in the first place?\nThe Bitcoin industry is a tricky industry to understand. As a relatively new space that is gaining popularity many, such as the FTC, believe that it needs looking into, particularly when a company grows at a fast pace, which was the case with Butterfly Labs.\nIn 2013, the FTC received around 300 complaints from customers who were not happy with the service from Butterfly Labs. At the time, Butterfly Labs was a pre-order industry, which was a time when the market was shifting and could have played a factor in customers getting nervous about their hardware, thus sending in complaints to the FTC. Ownby says that a clear message was posted on the website about pre-ordering in a changing environment.\n\n\u201cWe were very clear, in very bold print saying that if you are uncomfortable with waiting for this product, do not order. This was something that was very clearly printed on our website. It said: \u201cIf you\u2019re uncomfortable waiting until the development is complete and the product is shipped, do NOT pre-order this product.\u201d\nThat, however, did nothing to stem the number of complaints to the FTC. This chart illustrates that the complaints Butterfly Labs started receiving came in when shipment of the 65-nm line of equipment was increasing in 2013. In 2014, 93 percent of all complaints were resolved.\n\u201cThis was our fourth product line, so we had already taken orders for, developed, and shipped out three or four previous product lines,\u201d said Ownby. \u201cThis was not a secret; it was out there. People had received our miners. Most of our customers that were in our 65 nanometer queue, as well as our 28 nanometer queue, were repeat customers.\u201d\nHe said it came as a surprise to Butterfly Labs when the FTC put out a press release calling the company \u201cbogus\u201d and \u201cscammers,\u201d obtaining a\u00a0court order in 2014 to shut down Butterfly Labs and freeze its assets. As a result of the three-month shutdown, a temporary receiver was put into place that cost Butterfly Labs more than a million dollars that had to be paid from customers\u2019 money. Not only that, but FTC legal bills and actions came from customers\u2019 money, too, while the company lost sales as a result of the FTC press release.\nDespite this, Butterfly Labs was reopened in late 2014 after the U.S. District Court rejected a request by the FTC for an injunction, asset freeze and appointment of a receiver. Judge Wimes ruled that the FTC was unlikely to succeed in their arguments. (Docket 201 Case No. 4:14\u00adCV\u00ad00815\u00adBCW). According to Butterfly Labs, this shutdown is what caused customers not to receive a refund or get an order from Butterfly Labs.\n\u201cThe FTC kept coming and decided that they were still going to have their case against us.

The Digital Currency Initiative wants to bring together global experts in areas ranging from cryptography to economics to privacy to distributed systems, to play a key role in Bitcoin technical development. According to Ito, the Media Lab should be an independent, neutral home to help with Bitcoin standards development. Three Bitcoin Core developers -- Gavin Andresen, Cory Fields, and Wladimir van der Laan -- have joined the MIT Media Lab.\nThe launch of the MIT Digital Currency initiative and the \u201ctakeover\u201d of three Bitcoin Core developers including Andresen, probably the best known and most influential Bitcoin developer, has been widely interpreted as a claim for technical leadership in the Bitcoin development space. Therefore, it\u2019s important to understand MIT Media Lab\u2019s position in the ongoing Bitcoin scaling debate.\nNow, Joi Ito is beginning to weigh in with an article titled \u201cMy view on the current situation of Bitcoin and the Blockchain.\u201d In the article, which promises to be the first of a series, Ito notes that the core developers of Bitcoin, who find themselves at home working on cryptography, systems, networks and code, are now unable to interface effectively with the commercial interests whose businesses depend on scaling the technology. They can only do their best, but their best isn\u2019t good enough for \u201cthose who don't understand the architecture or the nature of what is going on inside of Bitcoin,\u201d says Ito.\n\u201cIf you try to build \u2018something like Bitcoin but better!\u2019 it will probably turn out insecure, underwhelming, and will go against the the fundamental principles that give Bitcoin the potential to be as impactful to banking, law and society as the Internet has been to media, communication, and commerce,\u201d says Ito, noting many relevant parallels between the recent history of Bitcoin and the somewhat longer history of Internet protocols. \u201cGovernments and banks are launching all kind of plans without enough thought going into how they're actually going to build the secure ledger.\u201d\u00a0\nThis seems a direct jab to the many companies and institutions that are betting on non-Bitcoin blockchains and \u201cpermissioned\u201d blockchains where transactions can be validated only by vetted participants. Ito seems to agree with legendary cryptographer Nick Szabo, who believes banks and state actors should embrace the crowd-sourced power and resiliency of permissionless blockchains like Bitcoin.\u00a0\nIto concludes by expressing hope that the Bitcoin community will find ways to \u201chandle the inevitable disagreements in the future in a less emotional and more technical and operational way.\u201d\nIn related news, representatives from the Bitcoin industry and members of the development community, congregated in a \u201cBitcoin Roundtable,\u201d have reached an agreement on some of the controversial technical and operational development issues that Ito seems to allude to. The Bitcoin Core developers who signed the agreement include Fields, but not the other two developers -- Andresen and van der Laan -- supported by the MIT Media Lab. The official position of Ito and the Digital Currency Initiative on the Bitcoin Roundtable solution hasn\u2019t been disclosed at the moment.\nPhoto\u00a0Joi Ito\u00a0/ Flickr(CC)", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 24}

In December, we piloted a trivia competition between the MIT and McGill student clubs. Now with six schools across North America, Blockchain Madness is a way to discover trailblazing student clubs around the world and identify top students with proven technical skills and experience. We want the students who compete in March Madness to be seen as student all-stars, in a way similar to basketball players who compete in March Madness.\u201d\n\nThere will be three head-to-head matches, and the winning team from each will compete in a final round. Each match is set up in a similar way to a Jeopardy game. There are four categories with five questions in each category. Teams alternate choosing which question is asked and both teams are able to answer each question. If the team answers the question correctly, it is awarded points, and if it answers incorrectly it loses points.\nThere are a few variations from a typical Jeopardy game. There are two \u201cDISRUPT\u201d tiles, where the tile has a multiple of the number of points, or other fun variations to present unknown elements into the game that can help a team catch up or cement a victory. The last tile is called a \u201cLast Chance,\u201d and each team is able to wager as many points as it has up to that point before seeing the question. \u00a0\nPurse.io is the title sponsor of the event, and to celebrate, each campus is being given a refferal link for their campus, with a prize for the team that creates the most buzz.\u00a0\nIn addition, for two weeks leading up to the event, the Blockchain Education Network will post trivia questions daily to Twitter. Each question will have a certain value attached, and it will tally the scores from the community and create a scoreboard.

Addressing some 150 attendees filling up most of the available chairs at nine in the morning, Pierce explained what d10e was set to bring to Amsterdam.\n\u201cD10e is the first conference of its kind, bringing together a mixture of like-minded individuals building decentralized technologies,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cMany of these concepts overlap each other, so we stand to benefit greatly by all being in the same place and learning from each other. Think of decentralizing finance with Bitcoin and blockchains, decentralizing commerce with marketplaces like OpenBazaar, decentralizing telecommunications with\u00a0FireChat, and much more.\u201d\nD10e's former incarnation, Coin Congress, hosted conferences in San Francisco and Singapore throughout 2014 and 2015. Kicking off in the Dutch capital, the re-branded version established a partnership with gaming conference\u00a0Casual Connect, and will continue to tag along in different cities around the world, focusing on fintech, disruptive technology, the sharing economy and the future of work.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, d10e CEO and solutions strategist Tiffany Madison said:\n\n\u201cCoin Congress specifically focused on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, but that space has become very saturated over the years. And while a lot of these conferences are fascinating, they are often catered to and visited by a very similar group of people. To break out of that niche, to gear Bitcoin toward mass adoption \u2013 what we all want \u2013 we decided to include other disruptive technologies. From drones, to 3D-printing, to smart energy... anything furthering revolutionary ideas, and presented by speakers ranging from established thought leaders, to new blood at the forefront of evangelizing these new technologies. We hope to raise the expert level of all our attendees.\u201d\n\nThe first edition of d10e was hosted in collaboration with the\u00a0Bitcoin Embassy Amsterdam, the voluntary collaboration of Bitcoin enthusiasts evangelizing the technology from their cozy home-base cafe at the edge of the famous Red Light District. Speaking on behalf of the local embassy, proud host of the welcome reception as well as the closing party of the conference, co-founder and consultant for\u00a0Mr. Bitcoin Martijn Wismeijer said:\n\n\u201cThe setup of d10e is obviously quite different from our typical events. We typically draw in a mix of determined Bitcoin-enthusiasts, more casually interested sympathizers and newcomers who just heard about this technology and want to buy their first bitcoin. It's great to switch the tone up a bit and welcome a host of internationally renowned speakers and top-notch blockchain professionals this time. And working with the d10e team has been a great inspiration; as Bitcoin Embassy Amsterdam, we're proud to be part of this unique event.\u201d\n\nDespite the \u2013 for Amsterdam typical \u2013 cloudy, windy and rainy weather outside, Madison complied.\n\u201cAmsterdam is one of the hottest hubs for fintech startups in Europe, even in the world,\u201d Madison said. \u201cIt's an innovative city, with an incredible support structure for Bitcoin. And it's probably even more advanced than San Francisco when it comes to the sharing economy. It's an ideal place to bring the early adopters of these radical technologies together.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nToday marks the official release of Bitcoin Core 0.12.0, the twelfth generation of Bitcoin's reference client as first launched by Satoshi Nakamoto seven years ago. Developed by close to 100 contributors over seven months, the latest version of Bitcoin Core includes more than 20 improvements, particularly regarding performance, security and usability.\nThese are the sixth most notable changes.\nMemory Pool Limiting\nMemory pools are the collections of unconfirmed transactions as stored individually by all full nodes. Memory pools fill up in between blocks as new transactions are transmitted over the Bitcoin network and are depleted when these transactions are included in blocks. But if a series of subsequent blocks remain full for an extended period \u2013 either due to legitimate transactions or spam attacks \u2013 memory pools might not deplete completely, and backlogs could build up. With no maximum limit, the backlog might even grow to the point where nodes run out of memory and crash. (This is the \u201ccrash landing\u201d scenario former Bitcoin XT lead developer Mike Hearn feared.)\nMemory pool limiting, as the name suggests, enforces a hard limit on the maximum size of memory pools to prevent this scenario. If the maximum is reached, nodes reject or clear their memory pools of transactions that offer the lowest amount of fees per byte.\nFull node operators can configure their limits, but the default maximum size in Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 is set on 300 megabytes.\nBlockchain Pruning for Wallet Users\nOne of the burdens of running a full node is the requirement to store the complete blockchain. This adds up to 55 gigabytes at the time of this writing, and can grow another 50 gigabytes per year under the current 1-megabyte block size limit.\nTo decrease this requirement, Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 allows users to prune the blockchain, which means they can get rid of older data once their node has verified it. The amount of data to keep is configurable, though Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 will still require a minimum 2 gigabytes of disk space.\nPruning the blockchain does mean these nodes will no longer be able to share all the blockchain data with peers, such as full nodes syncing with the network for the first time.\n(It should be noted that pruning the blockchain was first introduced in Bitcoin Core 0.11.0, but was not yet available for users running Bitcoin Core as a wallet.)\nUpload Traffic Limiting\nFull nodes continually transmit and relay transactions and blocks to each other over Bitcoin\u2019s peer-to-peer network. This typically requires a modest amount of data to be downloaded, but sharing that same data with several peers at the same time can add up to significant upload costs.\nBitcoin Core 0.12.0 introduces a configurable data cap for upload traffic. If this cap comes within reach, the node will seize uploading blocks older than a week, typically requested by nodes first syncing with the network. Additionally, any light clients will be disconnected and no longer served any block data.\nOpt-in Replace-by-fee\nAs the number of transactions on the Bitcoin network increases, not all transactions might fit into blocks. As such, miners will probably pick the transactions sent by users who included most fees. This means that some transactions \u2013 from users that paid too low a fee \u2013 could never confirm at all. And since many full nodes and miners currently reject conflicting transactions (sent from the same inputs as an earlier transaction), low fee transactions can get \u201cstuck\u201d on the network.\nTo solve this, Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 introduces opt-in replace-by-fee. If a transaction is sent using opt-in replace-by-fee, users can replace their own transaction with a newer transaction by including a higher fee. (This also means that miners can increase their income, as they get to pick transactions that include higher fees.)\nThe \u201copt-in\u201d part of opt-in replace-by-fee means these types of transactions will not be the default, and will be flagged as replace-by-fee transactions on the Bitcoin network. Anyone relying on zero-confirmation transactions should want to monitor for these replace-by-fee transactions, as these could very easily be reverted until they are confirmed. (Of course, zero-confirmation transactions were never secure.)\nWhether opt-in replace-by-fee will actually be useful depends on Bitcoin miners; they ultimately decide which transactions to include in blocks, and under what policies.\nTor by Default\nWhile Bitcoin is often claimed to provide anonymity to users, this is not entirely true. Bitcoin users can be de-anonymized, for example, through the peer-to-peer network. If it is determined from which IP-address a transaction originated, this information can be used to identify Bitcoin users.\nTo protect users' privacy, Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 automatically connects to the Bitcoin network through anonymizing tool Tor (The Onion Router) \u2013 if Tor is installed on the same computer. Tor encrypts data and routes it through several nodes all across the world before broadcasting it. This makes it hard \u2013 perhaps impossible \u2013 to trace where a Bitcoin transaction originated.\n(It should be noted that using Tor in itself might not be sufficient to protect a Bitcoin user\u2019s identity. See Bitcoin Magazine's Beginners Guide to Bitcoin Privacy for more information.)\nFaster Signature Validation\nSignatures are the cryptographic trick where private keys are \u201ccombined\u201d with any other data to calculate a unique string of numbers. Corresponding public keys can be used to verify that the signatures were created using the private keys. In Bitcoin's case, signatures are effectively used to prove ownership of bitcoin, and, as such, to validate transactions.\nBut there are several ways to conduct this cryptographic trick, which could result in different signatures \u2013 all valid in their own way. And if different Bitcoin nodes apply different methods for validation, some nodes might consider certain transactions valid while other nodes do not, which could split the Bitcoin network.\nFollowing up on a soft fork to solve this problem last year, Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 now switches all validation from the \u201cOpenSSL\u201d cryptographic library to \u201clibsecp256k1\u201d, developed by Dr. Pieter Wuille, Gregory Maxwell and other Bitcoin Core developers.\nAs an added benefit, this new signature validation scheme requires less CPU-power, lowering the cost of running a full node and significantly decreasing block validation time.\nFor a full list of improvements, see Bitcoin Core 0.12.0's release notes on  GitHub.\nThanks to Bitcoin Core lead developer Wladimir van der Laan, and Ciphrex CEO and Bitcoin Core developer Eric Lombrozo for proofreading and added feedback.", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 23}

In a blog post during that period, ChangeTip VP of community development Victoria van Eyk responded to a user whose account had become inaccessible due to geopolitical factors by saying, \"Changetip has been looking to decentralize for four months now. If we want to keep ChangeTip functionality \u2014 money on social media, Bitcoin on social media \u2014 we need to...not hold custody of funds, so this never happens again. We are working on it.\" The user in question was able to retrieve funds through his main wallet, but not without a processing delay.\nAccording to Nick Sullivan, Founder and CEO of ChangeTip, today\u2019s launch of ChangeTip Wallet addresses all earlier concerns about decentralization and privacy by giving users more control over their accounts.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re really excited to launch something that\u2019s pure Bitcoin. Many in our community like ChangeTip, but shy away from the service because it is centralized. We talked for a while about creating this [new decentralized] product, and ultimately, we decided it was something we really wanted to build.\u201d \u00a0\nIn addition to the orginal tipping functionality,\u00a0ChangeTip Wallet will give users control over their own private keys. Sending and approving of payments can done via a web and mobile app. Restrictions on account size, transaction amounts and user locations have been removed.\nThe first release of ChangeTip Wallet will be demonstrated in person to limited and selected parties February 27, 2016 at a resort somewhere in North America. ChangeTip Wallet is currently in closed beta and will be available by invitation only. \u00a0Interested parties can join the list by entering their entering their e-mail addresses here.", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 26}

It is the largest annual project undertaken by the club and is one of the only academic Bitcoin conferences run entirely by students.\u00a0\nWorld-renowned speakers will be in Cambridge, Massachusetts for the event, including Shual Kfir, CTO of Digital Asset Holdings; Joseph Poon, co-author of the Lightning Network; and Jonas Schnelli, one of the Bitcoin Core developers.\nThe club's mission is to \u201cprovide forums where Bitcoin-related ideas, projects, programs, events, and businesses can be studied, discussed and developed,\u201d and the Expo is an extension of this goal. It creates a forum that brings together an international community to study the technology and discuss future implications.\u00a0\nBitcoin Magazine spoke with Nchinda, a third-year computer science student who is the president of the club and the executive director of the conference, to provide more details about the event.\nWhen asked about the goal of the event, Nchinda explained what makes this annual expo unique:\n\n\u201cThe expo is not a mishmash of related concepts, there is a definite function to its form. There are three things that make the MIT Bitcoin Expo a different experience from other Bitcoin conferences I've seen:\n1) It is a product of a 100 percent student-run organization. It is an academic event, and we don't seek a profit off of it; we raise only as much as we need.\n2) Tickets are cheap compared to most other conferences. We don't want money to be a barrier to entry. Last year, student tickets were free, this year I'm trying out the idea of ticket refunds in Bitcoin.\n3) There is no cost to become a speaker. This is something I am very firm on; no amount of money can buy you a position as a speaker. We ask speakers to come pro bono, which creates an interesting meld of established companies and fledgling \u00a0startups.\u201d\n\nNchinda explained that the theme of the first day of the Expo is primarily technical.\n\n\u00a0\u201cI want to start the Expo by looking at the challenges that Bitcoin is tackling. Then we'll move to related work inspired by Bitcoin. Bitcoin development has many parallels to the development of Internet, so Day One closes with looking at the relationship between the two.\u201d\u00a0\n\nNchinda continues that Day Two will move into the financial and business aspects of blockchain technology.\n\n\u201cThe sequence moves through examining the relationship between Bitcoin and traditional finance. We'll recognize the effort put in by financial companies to understand and develop blockchain technology. By the end of the afternoon we'll leave most of the technical discussion behind and attendees will get a dose of speculation on the future.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe MIT Bitcoin Club has been consistently leading grassroots movements to grow Bitcoin adoption on campus and is one of the most active chapters in the Blockchain Education Network. In 2014, the club hosted the first Bitcoin Airdrop, which they called the MIT Bitcoin Project, after they raised $500,000 to give out $100 to every incoming freshman. It also launched the MIT BitComp to inspire and motivate MIT students and alumni to develop Bitcoin-related apps, with $15,000 in prizes that were awarded to the most impressive projects.\nNchinda is encouraging club members to promote Bitcoin and related technologies from whatever angle interests them, whether from the perspective of finance, mining, cryptography or marketing.\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 25}

In the few cases that the machines were shipped to customers, they had already been used by the company beforehand, generating valuable bitcoin for Butterfly Labs instead of the customer who had already paid for the hardware.\nThe charges filed against Butterfly Labs include that it failed to disclose to customers that it was using the machines, and that it kept upfront payments from customers even when it failed to deliver the hardware.\n\u201cBFL tested equipment on the live network generally from less than two hours to two days in the event units were in production over a weekend,\u201d Butterfly Labs said in a statement. \u201cThis insured that customers received reliable and working equipment avoiding unnecessary down time. Customer shipments were not delayed for burn testing.\u201d\nAfter the FTC received 500 complaints from customers who failed to receive their orders, Butterfly Labs was temporarily shut down. It is alleged that the company took around\u00a0$50 million in orders it failed to deliver. As a consequence, the FTC obtained a\u00a0court order freezing the assets of Butterfly Labs in 2014. The company was\u00a0later reopened following court approval in 2015. Despite this, BFL says that it successfully engineered, manufactured and shipped more than 50,000 Bitcoin machines through five product generations over four years to thousands of customers.\nIn a bid to wrap the case up and to provide refunds to customers, the FTC has forced the company into a $39 million out-of-court settlement. However, that out-of-court amount will be suspended once the company pays $15,000 and co-founder Sonny Vleisides pays an additional $4,000. Darla Drake, Butterfly Labs general manager, will also have her judgment of $135,878 suspended once she surrenders the cash value of all bitcoins she attained using machines from the company.\nBut while the judgements were suspended based on the defendant\u2019s inability to pay, they will become due should the defendants be found to have lied about their financial situation.\n\u201cEven in the fast-moving world of virtual currencies like Bitcoin, companies can\u2019t deceive people about their products,\u201d said Jessica Rich, director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection. \u201cThese settlements will prevent the defendants from misleading consumers.\u201d\nIt has been alleged that the three named members of Butterfly Lab\u2019s board of directors \u2013 Drake, Nasser Ghoseiri and Vleisides \u2013 spent millions of dollars of the company\u2019s revenue on non-business expenses such as guns and saunas instead of focusing on many orders from customers that were delayed or unfulfilled.\nFurthermore, amid the alleged fraud, Butterfly Labs has been accused of\u00a0printing foam pitchforks to make fun of its intensely frustrated customers.\u00a0\nHelen Wong, an FTC attorney\u00a0said:\n\n\u201c\u2026instead of fulfilling orders immediately, Defendants used their customers\u2019 machines to mine bitcoins for themselves before shipping the now-used machines to their customers. \u2026 Further demonstrating Defendants\u2019 disregard for their customers, they used corporate funds to make and mass order red foam pitchforks mocking their own customers, emblazoned with the words, \u201cY U NO SHIP \u2013 BFL IS LATE!\u201d\n\nWhile the company is operating, the settlement with the FTC means that the defendants have been prohibited from making any misleading claims about their Bitcoin mining products in the future and are banned from taking upfront payments from customers unless the products are available and will be delivered within 30 days. If they fail to do this, they must provide a refund.\nButterfly Labs continues to dispute FTC\u2019s suit and is focusing on refunding customers.\n\u201cBFL continues to believe that the FTC case had no merit, but agreed to settle for $15,000 to avoid ongoing litigation expenses and conserve remaining assets for payment of refunds to consumers,\u201d a BFL spokesperson stated.\nIn a\u00a0statement from January, Butterfly Labs claims to have \u201cinsufficient funds to pay out all refund requests at the present time.\u201d That same statement goes on to say that in 2014 and 2015 the company had refunded a total of $16.6 million to customers; however, a lack of finances at present had significantly impacted paying refunds.\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 25}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nIn a recent interview with Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin, Bitcoin Foundation Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen explained his issues with Bitcoin Core and why he has decided to help the Bitcoin Classic project.\u00a0\nBitcoin Classic is an implementation of an alternative Bitcoin protocol that would cause a hard fork with a 75 percent activation threshold in order to increase the block size limit from 1 megabyte to 2 megabytes.\nDuring the interview, Andresen said Bitcoin Core developers are not listening to miners and the entities that are creating many of the transactions on the Bitcoin network. He also discussed his future plans as a developer in the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nThe Market Will Decide What\u2019s Best\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has routinely referred to the Bitcoin Classic vs. Bitcoin Core debate as an election, and Andresen appeared to agree with this sentiment during the interview. In terms of the possibility of Bitcoin Classic taking over as the reference implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, Andresen noted:\n\u201cThe market will decide. That\u2019s kind of where the rubber meets the road with Bitcoin is what software people decide to run.\u201d\nAlthough it\u2019s practically impossible to operate Bitcoin as a direct democracy (and may not be a good idea), support for changes to the consensus rules are often measured via miner support. Miners can broadcast their support for a particular change via a coinbase transaction.\nIs Bitcoin Core Listening to Its Customers?\nWhen asked about his main disagreement with the rest of the Bitcoin Core development team (which Andresen is still technically part of), the Bitcoin Classic developer talked about Core\u2019s unwillingness to listen to its users. He stated:\n\n\u201cThe root of my issue with [Bitcoin] Core is I just think that they\u2019re not listening to their customers. I don\u2019t think that they\u2019ve been listening to the miners, and I don\u2019t think that they\u2019ve been listening to the people that do the bulk of the transactions on the network.\u201d\n\nThe idea that Bitcoin Core is not listening to miners seems somewhat debunked based on the recent Bitcoin Roundtable meeting in Hong Kong, though it should be noted this took place after Andresen\u2019s interview on Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin was recorded. As a result of the meeting, representatives of roughly 80 percent of the network hashrate were able to come to consensus with a handful of Bitcoin Core contributors on a future hard fork to increase the block size limit. It should be noted that it is unclear whether the agreement from the Bitcoin Roundtable will also reach consensus among the rest of the Bitcoin Core development team.\nThe level of communication between Bitcoin Core and some of the main creators of Bitcoin transactions, such as Coinbase and Blockchain.info, remains unclear, although Blockstream President Adam Back has publicly invited Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong to the upcoming Satoshi Roundtable, which will have a few Bitcoin Core contributors in attendance.\nCompanies Taking Matters Into Their Own Hands\nWith support from Coinbase and Blockchain.info\u2019s Peter Smith, Bitcoin Classic could be an example of these companies taking matters into their own hands. Andresen hinted at the unrest among some Bitcoin companies during his interview:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve long said that if companies aren\u2019t happy with what Core is doing, then they should either get developers involved in Core or they should start their own projects. And I think companies haven\u2019t been happy with the direction Core is going and haven\u2019t been happy with the priorities that Core has set -- as expressed by, kind of, the code that they\u2019re producing.\u201d\n\nAndresen mentioned that exchanges and wallet providers are some of the loudest proponents of larger blocks due to the way the issue is negatively affecting their companies right now. Indeed, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has been a major supporter of Bitcoin Classic on Twitter and Medium.\nAndresen Ready to Contribute to All Bitcoin Projects\nWhen it comes to Gavin Andresen\u2019s own plans for the future, it appears he\u2019s ready to help any Bitcoin project, including Bitcoin Core. He explained:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to contribute to lots of different projects. I think my contributions will wax and wane based on whether I\u2019m researching some interesting new area of computer science that catches my eye or am I done researching and I decide that I actually want to write some code people might actually decide to use.\u201d\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

This is the question that a portion of the Bitcoin community has been asking almost nonstop since the controversy around this possible alteration to the protocol went into hyperdrive last year.\nIn a recent appearance at Bitcoin Meetup Switzerland, Bitcoin Core Contributor Jonas Schnelli covered at least one possible issue with raising the block size limit too quickly: the effect larger blocks have on wasted resources for miners.\nIt should be noted that Schnelli has decided not to take an official, public stance on the block size debate.\nIn Bitcoin Mining, Every Second Counts\nA key point to understand about bitcoin mining is every second of hashing affects one\u2019s ability to turn a profit. New blocks are not received by all nodes on the network instantaneously, which means miners are, at least at times, wasting resources by building on an old block that is no longer the most recent. After all, a miner can only build on top of someone else\u2019s found block after he knows that block exists.\nSchnelli explained this issue during his recent talk in Zurich:\n\n\u201cThere are consequences with 2-megabyte blocks. Chinese miners -- they are now [for] 2- megabyte blocks, but maybe it will turn out to be a problem for them . . . Every second really counts . . . When you mine a block that is no longer valid and you don\u2019t get the information that a new block is here, you\u2019re wasting lots of energy. If it\u2019s just ten seconds you mine on the wrong block, you lose energy, and you lose coins in the end. That\u2019s why, with Chinese miners [especially], every second counts, and [with] 2-megabyte [blocks], it\u2019s twice the bandwidth you need.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time a Bitcoin Core contributor has talked about the issue of block propagation in terms of the mining process. Multiple developers discussed this problem in interviews during the leadup to Scaling Bitcoin Montreal.\nDo Bigger Blocks Mean Bigger Profits for Bigger Miners?\nIn the past, Bitcoin Core Contributor Peter Todd also has discussed this issue. During his presentation at Scaling Bitcoin Montreal, Todd explained how lousy block propagation becomes more problematic when the Great Firewall of China is factored into the equation.\nDue to the way the Great Firewall works, miners in China often find out about new blocks before miners in other countries (especially across the world in the United States). Since China also currently holds a majority of the hashing power on the network, miners who are not in China end up losing out on a bit of revenue. This is due to the fact that, on average, miners outside of China will hear about new blocks later than miners inside of China, which means non-Chinese miners waste more resources on blocks that have already been found.\nTodd pointed to some past research to illustrate his point during his Scaling Bitcoin talk:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done various simulation results. A big one that works out very well is Pieter Wuille\u2019s work where we\u2019ve gone and shown that -- and he actually used realistic mining and latency networks with this where when you look at the situation in China, for the amount of time it takes data to propagate over the Great Firewall of China and their relative hashing power percentage -- people who are not part of that group are earning something about like eight percent less revenue.\u201d\n\nTodd noted that losses are lower in reality due to Blockstream Core Tech Engineer and Bitcoin Core Contributor Matt Corallo\u2019s Bitcoin Relay Network, and it should also be pointed out that Pieter Wuille\u2019s work was testing 20-megabyte blocks.\u00a0\nThe point here is large miners have an added advantage over small miners due to the time it takes for miners to learn about new blocks. If the block size limit were increased, it would take longer for blocks to propagate around the network, thus increasing this advantage.\nOne of the original founders of Bitcoin Classic, Jonathon Toomim, also presented on the issues related to block propagation with bigger blocks at Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong. His testing focused on the now-withdrawn BIP 101 proposal, and he concluded that the increase to 8 megabytes would not be appropriate. During his tests, he found it took anywhere between 15 and 150 seconds to send block data to another peer when the two parties were on opposite sides of the Great Firewall of China.\nAt the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s DevCore Workshop back in October, Bitcoin Core Developer Gregory Maxwell explained that the second-to-last mining pool to learn about a new block is currently dealing with a 5 percent orphan rate.\nOn a related note, there\u2019s a theorized vulnerability in Bitcoin mining, known as selfish mining, where a miner may decide to not let others know about a block they found in order to give themselves a head start on finding the next block.\nPossible Solutions to Block Propagation Issues\nThere are a few proposed solutions that could solve the issue of slow block propagation on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin Core\u2019s current roadmap includes two such solutions: invertible bloom lookup tables (IBLTs) and weak blocks. According to the Bitcoin Core website, these two features can offer a 90 percent reduction in critical bandwidth when relaying blocks, which should allow for a safer increase of the block size limit.\nTwo possible solutions recently brought up by Bitcoin Classic Developer Gavin Andresen on this issue are UDP broadcast of block headers and validationless mining. Bitcoin Security Consultant Sergio Lerner recently wrote a blog post on the latter of the two options.\nThere are also other proposed solutions for this issue, but the point is that plenty of smart people are working on potential fixes. Based on Bitcoin Core\u2019s roadmap, it appears that IBLTs and weak blocks are the most likely solutions to get implemented first.\u00a0\nIt should also be mentioned that, as Blockchain Capital Managing Partner Brock Pierce recently pointed out, China\u2019s control over the majority of hashing power may not last forever.\nScaling Bitcoin Is Not Simple\nOne of the last points made by Schnelli at Bitcoin Meetup Switzerland is that the issue of scalability is not as simple as some have made it out to be.\nSchnelli noted:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say I\u2019m looking behind every curtain, but if you don\u2019t really go down to the technical fundamentals it\u2019s easy to say, \u2018Increase the block size.\u2019 Sure. Sounds nice. Everybody can understand it. But there are better solutions that maybe take more energy to think about.\u201d\n\nLike many other developers involved with Bitcoin Core, Schnelli views Segregated Witness (SegWit) as a viable alternative to simply increasing the block size limit. Bitcoin Core Contributor Eric Lombrozo recently outlined five benefits of the SegWit proposal at Blockchain Agenda San Diego.\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

This would mean that virtual money, such as Bitcoin, would become the regulatory equivalent of conventional currency.\nLegislators of the financial services industry believe that this move could potentially strengthen consumer protection and create growth in the virtual economy. At the moment, Bitcoin is recognized as \u201can object,\u201d but it is not considered equal to more established forms of currency.\nThe proposed changes to the definition of virtual currencies would mean that items such as Bitcoin could be used to purchase goods and services. Additionally, they would be considered exchangeable for legal tender via trade or purchase.\nHowever, acknowledging virtual currency as an equivalent to conventional currency would require certain institutions to register with the Financial Services Agency.\nThis is not the first time Japan has examined Bitcoin and its global use, as seen in a press conference held in 2014. At the time, Finance Minister Taro Aso addressed how Bitcoin has been treated in Japan, as well as around the world.\n\u201cThe media may regard it as such, but it is not a currency that everyone recognizes as currency, so I don\u2019t really know whether the Ministry of Finance or the Financial Services Agency should have jurisdiction over something that is not a currency, whether the Consumer Affairs Agency should have jurisdiction because it is used by consumers, or whether the National Police Agency should have jurisdiction because a crime may have been committed,\u201d said Aso. \u201cIn Japan, the issue is quite advanced, so for quite some time I have thought that some actions might have to be taken in Japan, though I think that this time has come much earlier than expected.\u201d\nCurrently, there are more than 600 forms of virtual currencies used around the world. As of February 24, one bitcoin holds the value of approximately 47,000 Japanese yen.\nAs the prominence of virtual currencies continues to grow, Nikkei reports that monetary authorities are attempting to institute regulations to address issues, such as money laundering.\nIn 2015, Aso addressed the use of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies for the purpose of funding terrorism and other crimes.\n\u201cI think it was at the G7 summit that discussions addressed the need to introduce regulations in order to prevent terrorist funding, tackle money laundering, and so on,\u201d Aso said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gathered a lot of information, and I think that the actual ways the currencies are used need to be properly reflected, and I think that studies need to continue concerning an approach.\u201d\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 24}

Since its establishment in 2013, Kryptokit has maintained its reputation for providing a secure platform that has not experienced a single case of customer fund loss from hacking attacks or data breaches.\nThe Kryptokit team completed the launch of its wallets on Android, Apple iOS, Chrome Extension and Firefox Nightly. In the next few days, the Kryptokit development team will launch Jaxx Bitcoin and Ethereum wallets for Windows desktop, Apple desktop, BlackBerry mobile and Linux kernel.\nThe Android tablet version of Jaxx wallets launched this week \u00a0features a single-page, intuitive and simple user experience, enabling Bitcoin and Ethereum users to transact the two digital currencies with ease. The coding of Jaxx Bitcoin and Ethereum wallets for Android and iOS applications are designed primarily with JavaScript to enhance the efficiency and simplicity of the application.\nThe architecture\u00a0of Jaxx\u2019s Bitcoin and Ethereum wallets is similar to the approach of mobile application development framework Apache Cordova. The Kryptokit team explains that a thin JavaScript application layer on its Android and iOS application processes all of the wallet-side operations.\u00a0\nJaxx wallets also use a cryptography library on the JavaScript side to\u00a0keep it unified across their implementations. More important, the Kryptokit team says the code allows the wallets to rely on a client-side security model, with private keys hosted locally that are never sent to any other servers, reducing the risk of vulnerability and key compromise.\nAfter the Kryptokit development team completes the launch and implementations of Jaxx wallets across all of the targeted platforms, it will begin integrating various software and technologies to optimize user and trading experience.\u00a0\nDi lorio says that once the first stage of the development phase is complete (infrastructure phase), the development team will begin integrating technologies such as ShapeShift\u2019s instant cryptocurrency exchange API to allow users to convert Bitcoin to Ethereum and vice versa.\u00a0\n\u201cPhase 2 (integrations such as ShapeShift) is easily achieved once the groundwork of Stage 1 has been completed. Our goal is to become the default wallet for Bitcoin and Ethereum. We believe Jaxx's single page design-led UX, easy to deploy unified codebase, ability to pair on over a dozen devices, and unique messaging layer gives us an edge in appealing to the masses. I expect the integration phase to begin in March, and SS is first on the list,\u201d said Di lorio.\nThe integration of ShapeShift and collaboration with its CEO Erik Voorhees, who previously mentioned that ShapeShift will be providing advanced Ethereum functionality and improved contract support for Bitcoin, will bring the Jaxx wallets into a completely new level, with which users can trade freely with minimal fees directly from the wallets.\nWith the marketcap of Ethereum surpassing $462 million and Bitcoin maintaining its price stability, the Kryptokit team believes Jaxx wallets will become increasingly popular among Ethereum and cryptocurrency enthusiasts in general. More than 2,000 users have downloaded the Jaxx Android and iOS apps already, in just a few days after its launch.", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 24}

This is considered inconsistent by some.\nBut this difference can be explained. Certain rule changes, implemented in certain forks, impact the Bitcoin network very differently than others. Or more specifically: Certain rule changes impact very different layers of the Bitcoin network. And some of these rules changes can split the Bitcoin network while others cannot.\nTo clarify these differences, Bitcoin Core developer and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo recently proposed to tag the relevant layers in all Bitcoin Improvement Proposals. These are the four main layers on the Bitcoin network as specified in his BIP 123, and the respective importance of consensus on each.\nThe Consensus Rules\nThe consensus rules are Bitcoin's most important rules. They establish \u2013 among many other things \u2013 the amount of bitcoins included in the block reward, the mining difficulty, the type of proof-of-work required, and, indeed, the block size limit.\u00a0\nThese rules are so important because they determine which blocks are deemed valid by full nodes. And if all full nodes apply the same consensus rules, it ensures they all maintain an identical copy of the blockchain.\u00a0\nIf different nodes apply different consensus rules, however, they risk accepting blocks that other nodes reject. Such discrepancy could lead to different nodes maintaining completely incompatible versions of the blockchain, effectively splitting the Bitcoin network.\nBitcoin's consensus rules can be changed in two ways. A change that adds extra rules to the protocol (making previously valid blocks invalid) is called a soft fork. Soft forks require a majority of hash power to support the change. The blocks that are produced under the new rules would be valid under the old rules as well, so nodes that didn\u2019t upgrade would still follow the longest chain.\nHowever, non-upgraded miners might produce blocks that are invalid under the new rules, wasting hash power. And non-upgraded full nodes would no longer be able to verify whether blocks adhere to the new rules, requiring them to wait additional confirmations to achieve the same level of security.\u00a0\nFor these and other reasons, the Bitcoin Core development team has said that it will typically require\u00a0a super-majority of 95 percent of hash power to agree on soft forks.\nA consensus rule change that removes rules from the protocol (making previously invalid blocks valid) is called a hard fork. A hard fork requires all full nodes on the network to adopt. Any node that doesn't implement the change might not follow the longest chain at all, as it could consider that chain invalid and stay on the \u201cold\u201d chain instead. This could split the Bitcoin network as described above. How long such a split would persevere is not really a technical question, but rather a debate on politics, sociology, economics, game theory and more.\nSoft fork changes to the consensus rules without consensus could \u2013 in a worst-case scenario \u2013 cause a minority of miners to waste hash power, and (slightly) degrade the security of full nodes.\nHard fork changes to the consensus rules without consensus could \u2013 in a worst-case scenario \u2013 split the Bitcoin network.\nPeer-to-Peer Layer\nThe peer-to-peer layer of the Bitcoin network covers how full nodes share data and what data they share. This includes protocol rules to send and receive transactions and blocks, as well as special data packages such as Segregated Witnesses or Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables.\nMost importantly, the peer-to-peer layer must ensure that new blocks find their way through the entire network, as well as data packages required to verify blocks. If this relay policy fails, it could result in a network split where different nodes hold different versions of the blockchain \u2013 at least until blocks find their way through the entire network again.\nBut as opposed to the consensus rules, it\u2019s not necessarily a huge problem if not every single node applies the exact same relay policy. Since most nodes forward blocks to at least eight peers, this amplifier should ensure that all nodes receive all blocks even if some of them don\u2019t forward properly.\nNodes have even more leeway when it comes to relaying transactions. Most nodes on the Bitcoin network today use a \u201cfirst seen\u201d policy: If they receive two or more conflicting transactions, they reject the latter. But a growing number of nodes apply variations of \u201creplace-by-fee\u201d policies, meaning they pick the transactions which include the highest fees \u2013 regardless of which came first. Additionally, some nodes reject certain types of transactions altogether, or don\u2019t relay any transactions at all.\nThat said, miners ultimately decide which transactions they include in blocks, and why. It\u2019s only when transaction relay policies vary wildly, or are sufficiently restrictive, that it might become unpredictable which transactions are confirmed for these reasons alone.\nChanges to the peer-to-peer layer without consensus could \u2013 in a worst-case scenario \u2013 split the network. This risk exists if blocks can\u2019t find their way throughout the whole network. The split will, however, automatically resolve once the network is reconnected.\nIf the changes concern transactions only, they could \u2013 in a worst case scenario \u2013 prevent certain transactions from confirming. It could also decrease the reliability of unconfirmed transactions. But it cannot split the network.\nApplication Programming Interfaces and Remote Procedure Calls\nThe Application Programming Interface (API) and Remote Procedure Call (RPC) layers are communications layers on top of the peer-to-peer protocol. Many Bitcoin software applications \u2013 such as mobile wallets and block explorers \u2013 communicate with the blockchain through these layers by connecting to an API or software library.\nIf one of these layers fails, all connected software applications will be unable to reliably communicate with the Bitcoin network. Mobile wallets won't know if they received Bitcoin, and blockchain explorers can't tell whether a new block was found. However, all other Bitcoin users won\u2019t notice a thing; the network itself is still running fine.\nChanges to the API and RPC layers without consensus could \u2013 in a worst-case scenario \u2013 completely disconnect users of these layers from the Bitcoin network. But such changes cannot split the network itself.\nApplications\nLast, the application layer refers to how Bitcoin software applications create and use certain types of data that doesn\u2019t really touch the network directly, but that is useful to synchronize across applications.\nThis includes, for example, address formats, private keys generation or wallet back-ups. If one wallet generates an address that another wallet doesn't consider valid, transacting between them will be impossible. Or if one wallet uses one method to create a backup address seed, and another wallet uses another, users can't recover their private keys with each wallet. The same goes for wallet backups.\nChanges to the application layers without consensus could \u2013 in a worst case scenario \u2013 prevent some users from mutually transacting, and cause other inconveniences. Such changes cannot split the network.\u00a0Thanks go out to Lombrozo for technical guidance.", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 26}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nAlthough Bitcoin has a reputation as a haven for criminals who wish to transact online in an anonymous manner, it doesn\u2019t appear the currently available wallet options are very helpful for this potential use case of the digital cash system. In their second edition of the Bitcoin Wallet Privacy Rating Report, released Sunday, the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project (OBPP) has painted a rather dismal picture of privacy in Bitcoin wallets.\nThe OBPP report says that many privacy-focused initiatives for Bitcoin \u201cstalled out\u201d in 2015. In the introduction to the report, OBPP contributor Kristov Atlas writes, \u201cImprovements are desperately needed to keep Bitcoin independent and safe.\u201d\nLedger Takes the Top Spot\nAlthough Ledger can rejoice in the fact that it has created the most private Bitcoin wallet on the market, the fact that it scored only 50 out of 100 possible points should give every Bitcoin user pause. Ledger has released a variety of hardware devices, which have been integrated into multiple third-party wallets, but the OBPP\u2019s report focused on the Ledger Nano and the company\u2019s own wallet solution.\nIn the report, it is noted that Ledger\u2019s Chrome extension-based Bitcoin wallet does not contain advanced privacy features. In fact, it doesn\u2019t even store a local copy of the blockchain. Ledger\u2019s positive marks appear to have come from its ability to assist users in avoiding address reuse and managing multiple accounts within the same wallet.\nCoinbase Places Last Again\nCoinbase is the service that placed last in the OBPP\u2019s original review of Bitcoin wallets in the spring of last year, and the a16z-backed company has taken the bottom spot again in 2016. Of course, it should be noted that Coinbase offers a variety of services that make it difficult for them to provide high-levels of privacy to its users. In fact, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong recently wrote a Medium post\u00a0titled \"Coinbase is not a wallet\"\u00a0about how the company is more of a retail exchange than a wallet provider.\nIn the OBPP\u2019s report, the custodial nature of Coinbase\u2019s consumer wallet is pointed out as a major flaw. Although Coinbase is required to follow Know-Your-Customer (KYC) guidelines because it also handles fiat money, the report claims some privacy improvements, such as discouraging address reuse, can be made without disrupting the company\u2019s KYC responsibilities.\nCoinbase is able to offer mainstream users unique features, such as USD balances, which make it easier for some individuals to interact with Bitcoin as a payment system. Some will say it doesn\u2019t make sense to include Coinbase, which is essentially a Bitcoin bank, in a report about wallets, but it\u2019s important for users to be aware of the privacy-related consequences of using this type of custodial wallet.\nIs Privacy in Bitcoin Dead?\nThis report from the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project will definitely be an eye-opener for individuals who believe they can use Bitcoin privately with a variety of wallets. Perhaps the most troubling aspect of the report is that the world\u2019s two most popular Bitcoin wallets, Blockchain and Coinbase, both scored in the bottom four of all wallet providers.\nOne of the only bright spots of the report is Samourai, which is ranked sixth in Bitcoin wallet privacy. The report notes a number of promised features that will eventually be integrated into the relatively new wallet option and adds, \u201cThe wallet is off to a strong start in 2015, and threatens to usurp Darkwallet for the spotlight in 2016 as the defacto choice for privacy-minded users.\u201d\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

We didn't have time to join in. Just too many things we've been working on,\u201d said State Street senior managing director Hu Liang. \u201cThe next version of testing, which is a series of two tests, we'll be a part of,\u201d he added.\nSimilarly, Kookmin Bank is on joint development with Coinplug to develop a blockchain-based platform that enables efficient international remittance payments. By establishing a distributed ledger-based banking and remittance network, the bank aims to offer customers and its clients faster and more robust foreign exchange services in Asia.\nThe bank also will develop a blockchain-based public network to support overseas fund transfer and data storage service for online bank account verification. Kookmin Bank understands that the blockchain network\u2019s irrefutable and transparent nature enables anyone on the network to encrypt and secure data quickly, without the involvement of an intermediary or a third-party application. Using this advantage of the blockchain technology, the bank plans to implement Bitcoin\u2019s underlying technology in various banking platforms and technologies.\n\u201cThe blockchain technology is a new trend, and we are trying to adopt this technology in a low level of data integrity platform,\u201d said a Kookmin Bank representative. \u201cWe are planning to escalate our services further to provide more secure and comfortable financial services for our customers.\u201d\nIn the near future, Kookmin Bank and Coinplug will push the development of an overseas remittance platform, in which the bank\u2019s customers and institutional clients will not be required to receive confirmations from banks and mediators.\nThe traditional bank-based remittance payment network requires the presence of both the applicant bank and the beneficiary bank. For example, if Alice wants to send Bob $50,000 from a Kookmin Bank account to a JP Morgan bank account, the applicant bank (Kookmin Bank) will have to contact the beneficiary bank (JP Morgan) within the SWIFT network to confirm the international remittance payment. However, the involvement of both banks as intermediaries will increase the transaction cost of the remittance payment, making the payment much more expensive and inefficient compared to a transaction settled on the blockchain.\nOver the next few months, Kookmin Bank will work closely with Coinplug to disrupt Asia\u2019s finance industry with a next-generation blockchain-based payment system.\nPhoto m-louis / Flickr(CC)\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 1}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nLaunched in 2011 by an ensemble of dedicated open-source developers led by Bitcoin\u2019s rebellious hacker\u00a0Amir Taaki,\u00a0Libbitcoin was born a tool of resistance.\u00a0\nOffering an alternative to the original Bitcoin client, its goal was to diversify the Bitcoin development ecosystem, ensuring no single development team retained effective control over the network. \u201cCentralized software is vulnerable to the dictates of whoever controls development of that software code, and any dictates pressured onto them,\u201d Taaki\u2019s Libbitcoin manifesto reads.\nFive years later, Taaki has vanished from the Bitcoin scene. But Libbitcoin, a set of cross-platform, open-source libraries that serve as building blocks for a variety of Bitcoin applications, continues to grow. They are now maintained by a loosely tied team led by Seattle-based software architect and former naval aviator Eric Voskuil, and form the basis of services including\u00a0Airbitz,\u00a0DarkWallet (alpha) and\u00a0OpenBazaar (soon in alpha).\nBitcoin Magazine sat down with Voskuil to learn more about this maverick implementation.\nEric, first of all, what happened to Amir? Do you know what he's up to these days?\nYes.\n...Yes?\nI'm in touch with him. He's doing well. But it\u2019s not really my place to say more.\nOK, so Amir seems gone for now. One of the reasons he launched Libbitcoin was to diversify the development ecosystem. Do these ideals live forth?\nI don't speak for other Libbitcoin contributors; each has their own reasons and their own opinions. But Libbitcoin's core values have always been privacy, scalability and integrity. Indeed, if any individual or group can change consensus rules \u2013 consensus means agreement by all \u2013 Bitcoin\u2019s integrity has been compromised.\nBitcoin, therefore, needs more than one body of main developers. I don't have any issues with the Core guys, technically or philosophically. I truly think they are doing great work and for the right reasons. But that is a sword that can cut both ways. Just as there has been cause for concern in the past \u2013 think of the Bitcoin Foundation funding development \u2013 we can assume there will be in the future.\nWhy is a homogeneous development ecosystem such a problem? No one is forced to run the software.\nTrue, but Bitcoin requires decentralization for survival. If there is only one team of experts maintaining the only implementation, the whole ecosystem is extremely weak. If that team ends up on one or two payrolls, or is perhaps co-opted by state actors, there are obvious implications. It's even worse than just having one Web browser, because the lack of diversity in browser choices is not as damaging to people as losing decentralized money.\nTo be strong, Bitcoin needs expert volunteers working in a global virtual community on various implementations that people actually use. This provides credible balance in the case of real conflict. Libbitcoin is playing the long game, and is making major investments in several important areas. This ultimately complements and improves other implementations, just as it benefits from them.\nIt's interesting that similar arguments have recently resurfaced. The Bitcoin Classic team in particular maintains that diversifying the development ecosystem is a key goal.\nThe important benefit of developer diversification is greater resistance to centralization pressure. Libbitcoin is first and foremost a tool of resistance, though to be effective it must also be great technology. A code fork that simply changes a consensus rule because there is not universal agreement is not resistance, it's an attack.\nFortunately, Bitcoin has always anticipated this scenario. The uncertainty may not be good for the exchange price in the short term, and people who aren't paying attention may lose money. But Bitcoin will be stronger for it. Bitcoin has to be able to withstand such attacks.\nIncreasing the block size limit by one megabyte is an attack?\nA dissenter always has the option to start another coin. But an attempt to cause a change in consensus rules without actual consensus is an attempt at theft. Such changes will favor some parties at the expense of others. It's impossible to predict specifically who will be harmed when a money is altered, since value is subjective. But the question becomes moot in the case of consensus. With consensus the change is an increase in value for all, since all prefer the change.\nIn Bitcoin, larger hash power currently has an increasing advantage as blocks grow in size. Similarly some businesses may benefit from the possibility of higher transaction volume and minimal fee pressure. Except to the extent that these parties are also coin-holders, the theft is not of their value. At the same time they have a financial interest in changing the rules.\nI'm not keen on any block size limit increase presently. I assume we may need to do so at some point, but given the minimal fee pressure we see today, there is absolutely no urgency. And given the lack of consensus it would not be appropriate to try.\nWouldn't it be better to avoid rising fees for now, to incentivize adoption? Be a bit more pragmatic?\nDecentralization is the purpose of Bitcoin and essential to its existence.\nLarger blocks create centralization pressure, an observation that does not seem to be in dispute among developers. And given the current state of the ecosystem, with a handful of pools directing most of the hash power and an apparent declining number of validating users, it seems one megabyte is problematic enough.\nBy analogy, imagine a door lock company advertising that they have the best locks on the market. People need to be able to get through doors, and their lock makes that really easy, so that the most people possible can get through! The company considers security important ... but not at the expense of ease-of-use. Can this reasonably be described as 'pragmatic'?\nIf Bitcoin centralizes and succumbs to the censors, it will have nothing to offer its users.\nCheap and fast transactions offer a certain value, don't they?\nSure, but costs are not reduced through the magic of Merkel trees, or some other mundane technology employed by Bitcoin. Costs are reduced by removing the state from the control of money. Censorship resistance is the only way Bitcoin achieves cost benefits over other financial technologies.\nPayPal set out to do the same things as Bitcoin, and failed. Upon running afoul of the censors, their business model was forced to change. The cheap, rapid, programmable, international peer-to-peer payments they imagined never materialized.\nSimilarly, if Bitcoin cannot resist state controls, countless intermediaries, high transaction costs, inflation taxes, bail-ins and state-by-state currency controls will remain the norm, and it won\u2019t be able to achieve lower cost.\nSatoshi said Bitcoin should be able to scale on-chain. He thought fees would be cheap, and he said that the block size limit could be lifted when needed.\nLook, there is no question whatsoever that the threat Satoshi was working to defeat is the state. And a path to Visa-level transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain is quite clearly a fatal blow to censorship resistance. His explanation of how the block size limit could be raised does not imply any contradiction, it's just Satoshi saying that when a block size increase makes sense it can be done. The decentralist perspective is not that the block size limit can never change.\nScarcity of block space would probably drive transaction fees up as well, to the point where perhaps only the wealthy can transact on-chain. Surely we must compromise somewhere?\nI'm aware of these arguments, but this is a 'split-the-difference' negotiating tactic based on a faulty premise. It's sort of like declaring that only the wealthy can fly because aircraft are expensive. But not everyone needs to own a private jet. The analogy in the legacy financial system would be consumers buying a cup of coffee using the SWIFT network directly.\nThere will inevitably be layering on Bitcoin, as analogous systems have done for centuries.\nWhat's interesting about rebuilding the SWIFT network? What happened to the vision of electronic cash?\nThe \u201celectronic cash\u201d envisioned by Satoshi is cash; it is not notes, scrip or bank credits. We have come to think of bank notes as cash, but they are actually contracts for debt. The note holder is owed something by the issuer. Cash is a commodity with certain properties that make it useful as money. Cash is largely gone from the world, and people cannot return to physical commodity money, as it cannot be moved online. Bitcoin is really our only option to guard against inflation, counterfeit, capital controls and high costs in general.\nAnd given that bitcoin \u2013 lowercase b \u2013 is cash, and the blockchain is the definitive truth on where the money is, Bitcoin \u2013 uppercase B \u2013 is a settlement system. If it wasn't, it must use something else for settlement \u2013 and that isn't the case.\nSome might take issue with this vision, but that's because they imagine existing banks, financial institutions, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 censorship. A global censorship-resistant settlement network is not like anything we've ever seen before. It is, indeed, the goal many people are working towards.\nThat system will allow people to buy their coffee with electronic cash, but Bitcoin will never carry every coffee purchase on-chain. Those who make the Visa-analogy either don\u2019t understand how Visa works, or don\u2019t understand how Bitcoin works. And let\u2019s not kid ourselves: Users really don't care how their transactions are cleared.\nRising fees might hurt Bitcoin startups as well.\nIndeed, much of the block size argument is coming from outside of what I consider Bitcoin. Organizations that operate centralized services, like web-wallets and APIs. The more successful they are, the less decentralized Bitcoin becomes.\nWhat people don't seem to realize is that you can't make money on Bitcoin in the way they are used to making money. A large part of the Bitcoin industry is fumbling around, burning off capital on stupid stuff. It's a common pattern in a new industry, I think. It's an interesting problem, profiting from a system that defies centralization and intermediaries, and that requires free software. ... But Bitcoin doesn\u2019t exist to be a profit vehicle for startups.\nSo how do you suggest Bitcoin move forward?\nFundamentally, the objective is human liberty. The perpetual ubiquity of decentralized money is necessary in advancing this goal. Individual users must validate their own money for Bitcoin to survive.\nBut this magnificent opportunity is falling away because it's easier to use centralized services. It's my desire to see developers contributing to the strength of Bitcoin, not inadvertently contributing to its demise. Libbitcoin is our contribution to helping them succeed.", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 29}

Currently, a share of GBTC is being traded at $57.40, and since a share of GBTC guarantees investors about one tenth of a bitcoin, investors are purchasing Bitcoin using GBTC at an average price of $602.71\u00a0per coin. That is a premium almost 40 percent higher than the actual price of Bitcoin.\nThe XBT Provider team explains that a few key factors have played a vital role in the increase in demand for exchange-traded notes and Bitcoin instruments in the past year. Speaking about the deman,\u00a0XBT Provider Marketing Manager Christoffer De Geer said:\n\n\u201cSince early 2015, with the exception of Mike Hearn\u2019s controversial resignation, the Bitcoin industry has received more positive news coverage from both Bitcoin and mainstream media outlets. The Bitcoin industry has seen emergence of an increasing number of startups and applications utilizing micropayments to offer real-world applications such as remittance and online incentive services, leading the general population ... to recognize the practical usages of Bitcoin transactions. More importantly, the price volatility of Bitcoin has substantially declined and the liquidity of Bitcoin has risen in regions including Europe, the U.S. and Southeast Asia.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAnother major factor is the decline in global asset classes, commodities and stocks, and the rising fear of investors for global economic slump.\n\n\n\u201cExternal factors might have helped as well. The Chinese stock market crash, the devaluation of the [Chinese] renminbi, the standoff between the E.U. and Tsipras in June. All these events have led to increased press coverage for Bitcoin focusing on critical advantages with Bitcoin compared to fiat currencies. We do not believe that the ongoing blockchain craze has done much good for the Bitcoin price yet, but we believe the that the private blockchain hype will translate to higher Bitcoin prices at a later stage.\u201d\nRecognizing the underwhelming performance of major stock exchanges and assets, Legendary Swiss investor Marc Faber said, \u201cWhen you talk about doom and gloom for this year, 2016, I have to point out that in 2015, with the exception of people that held bitcoins, the performance of all asset classes has been poor.\u201d\n\nWith hopes to recover from their losses, a large number of investors in the traditional finance sector have begun to shift their focus toward secure investments in Bitcoin that can eliminate the possibility of potential hacking attacks which could result in the loss of client funds. Thus, instead of purchasing Bitcoin at highly liquid Bitcoin exchanges, traditional investors prefer to purchase Bitcoin using Bitcoin instruments like GBTC and XBT Provider\u2019s ETNs, which guarantee the ownership of Bitcoin.\nBut XBT Provider states that GBTC is not a real financial instrument, as it offers trades at a premium to the actual Bitcoin price. According to De Geer:\n\n\u201cXBT Providers ETNs listed on Nasdaq Nordic are the only exchange-listed instruments we know of besides BIT\u2019s [Bitcoin Investment Trust] listing of GBTC. In comparison, GBTC is not a \u2018real\u2019 financial instrument of which they momentarily can issue more with increasing demand. XBT Provider\u2019s ETNs are still the only Bitcoin instruments that consistently trade at fair value and not at a premium to the actual Bitcoin price.\u201d\n\nAs the XBT Provider plans for global expansion, the team is looking forward to securing larger investments from institutional clients, and hoping to achieve new milestones throughout 2016.\n\u201cWe do have alternative investment hedge funds and insurance companies as investors and predict larger investments from more institutions in 2016, as more asset managers start to feel comfortable with Bitcoin,\u201d a team statement said.", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 1}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin Classic, the Bitcoin implementation set to double Bitcoin's 1 megabyte block size limit by a hard fork, suffered a significant setback shortly after its official release this week. A group of prominent exchanges, mining pools and other industry players organized under the \u201cBitcoin Roundtable\u201d collective, stated publicly they will not switch to Bitcoin Classic for the present.\nOpen Letter\nAn open letter by the Bitcoin Roundtable, including signatories representing major Bitcoin exchange Bitfinex, ASIC-manufacturer and mining pool BitFury, exchange, wallet service and mining pool BTCC, cloud hashing service Genesis Mining, mining pools F2Pool, BW Pool, Ghash.IO and others, states:\n\n\u201cWe think any contentious hard-fork contains additional risks and potentially may result in two incompatible blockchain versions, if improperly implemented. To avoid potential losses for all bitcoin users, we need to minimize the risks. It is our firm belief that a contentious hard-fork right now would be extremely detrimental to the bitcoin ecosystem.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Classic requires a 75 percent hash power activation threshold to activate a block size limit increase. Since the Bitcoin Roundtable collective accounts for more than 60 percent of hash power on the Bitcoin network today, activation seems unlikely unless some of the signatories reverse their positions.\nInstead, the letter expresses support for an initial block size limit increase through Segregated Witness. This solution, which was made a first step in Bitcoin Core's scalability \u201croadmap,\u201d offers an effective block size limit increase of .6 megabyte to 1 megabyte, along with additional improvements. As one of its main benefits, Segregated Witness can be rolled out as a soft fork, meaning only miners need to upgrade, rather than all nodes on the Bitcoin network.\nThe letter reads:\n\n\u201cWe see the need for a modest block size increase in order to move the Bitcoin project forward, but we would like to do it with minimal risk, taking the safest and most balanced route possible. [Segregated Witness] is almost ready and we support its deployment as a step in scaling.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Roundtable\nBitcoin Classic was first introduced a month ago by former Bitcoin Foundation board member Olivier Janssens, FinalHash CTO Marshall Long and Bitcoin miner and developer Jonathan Toomim. Shortly after Bitcoin XT lead developer Mike Hearn very publicly denounced Bitcoin a failed experiment, the alternative implementation quickly gained support from major Bitcoin industry players including Coinbase, Blockchain and Bitstamp, as well as Bitcoin Core veterans Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik.\nSeveral major mining pools initially endorsed Bitcoin Classic as well, but this support has been nuanced since. In the midst of a crisis atmosphere, mining pools and other companies organized several meetings across the world as well as online to discuss the situation. One of these meetings, the Bitcoin Consensus Round Table organized by BitFury a day after the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, formed the basis of what later resulted in the Bitcoin Roundtable letter.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, BitFury CIO Alex Petrov explained:\n\n\u201cBitFury was ready to support the Bitcoin Classic initiative \u2013 but this doesn't mean we planned to immediately start mining in favor of Bitcoin Classic or run Bitcoin Classic nodes. We do believe a hard fork block size limit increase must happen, but we ultimately want to avoid too much confrontation among miners, or a split within the community. This is not helping to move the Bitcoin project forward in any way. Rather, we should have a constructive conversation, start talking, get the perspectives from both sides of the debate. That way everyone can get a deeper understanding of potential issues, and we will be able to find solutions.\u201d\n\nThis call for unity was seconded by cloud hashing service Genesis Mining CFO Marco Krohn.\n\u201cThere is huge split in the community regarding the block size limit. The dispute has been going on for a while, first with Bitcoin XT and now between Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Core. But I think it's important to realize that both sides want Bitcoin to succeed; assuming anyone has bad intentions is not helpful,\u201d Krohn said.\nAnd, regarding concrete scaling proposals:\n\n\u201cSegregated Witness is a great idea, and almost everyone supports it. However, it's only a one-time capacity increase. There were several official and unofficial attempts to convince the Bitcoin Core development team to add a 2 megabyte block size limit increase hard fork to the roadmap, and be more specific about its implementation \u2013 but to no avail so far. The letter is an attempt to calm the situation, and to continue the constructive conversation with the Bitcoin Core development team. We are optimistic to find a solution which better addresses the needs of the businesses, miners and the rest of the community.\u201d\n\nChina\nPreviously, a subset of the Chinese mining community \u2013 most notably including major ASIC-manufacturer and mining pool Bitmain/AntPool \u2013 offered Bitcoin Core an alternative proposal. Rather than switching to Bitcoin Classic, involved companies proposed to raise the block size limit to 2 megabytes, but with a 90 percent hash power support requirement. This sentiment was later echoed by Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu, who said that AntPool will test Bitcoin Classic but does not support rolling out a hard fork block size limit increase in the short term. And, on its own Internet forum, Bitmain clarified it will not vow loyalty to any development team in specific:\n\n\u201cWe applaud the [Bitcoin] Core team's increased communication and willingness to find compromise, but we do not wish to bind ourselves to a document that does not contain concrete technical proposals. We look forward to reviewing Bitcoin Core's updated roadmap and evaluating it on its technical merits, but we do not believe that this should be done to the exclusion of other development efforts.\u201d\n\nOne of the driving forces behind the Bitcoin Roundtable letter, BTCC COO Samson Mow, acknowledged he does not expect a sudden switch to support Bitcoin Classic from mining pools, if there is any switch at all. Rather, he explained that the Bitcoin Roundtable has even broader support than the letter suggests.\n\u201cBitcoin Classic often overstates their support, or misconstrues support for 2 megabytes or a hard fork as support for Bitcoin Classic,\u201d Mow said. \u201cSome companies not on the signatory list have given a commitment to not run Bitcoin Classic until we see if Bitcoin Core can adapt. They support the Bitcoin Roundtable, but they would have preferred a more strongly worded request to Core, and so have refrained from signing. That was the compromise we reached.\u201d\nMow agreed the main goal right now is to get more clarity from Bitcoin Core on the proposed scalability roadmap, and said the Bitcoin Roundtable group will help to facilitate as needed.\nMow:\n\n\u201cEveryone is asking for a hard fork, but no one is talking about what exactly will go into the hard fork. Is it cleaning up the code a Segregated Witness soft fork left behind? Is it an increase to 2 megabytes or more? What will be the requirements for activation? We need to have those discussions together.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Classic\nWhile the Bitcoin Roundtable letter was a setback, Janssens, listed as \u201cfacilitator\u201d in the Bitcoin Classic release notes, has not given up hope for Bitcoin Classic. Addressing visitors of the r/btc subreddit, predominantly frequented by bitcoiners in favor of a hard fork block size increase, Janssens made clear that Bitcoin Classic intends to remain active \u2013 even if it does not achieve a hash rate majority in the short term.\n\n\u201cClassic is here to stay. We finally have a great competing client with a lot of traction,\u201d Janssens said. \u201cDon't let the recent letter discourage you. We still have double digits coming on board of Classic soon, and the rest will follow quickly when the fee event will take place in the next weeks. We cannot run away from reality, and the time for more talk and debate is over. The block size limit will be hit very soon.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, at least one mining pool so far stated public support for Bitcoin Classic. Slush Pool, accounting for some 4 percent of total hash power, has committed to let individual miners vote on a potential block size limit increase.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Slush Pool operator Marek \u201cSlush\u201d Palatinus explained:\n\n\u201cI still like Bitcoin XT or even solutions which remove block size limit completely, but consider it a politically dead solution, so there's no point in pushing it over and over. I therefore support Bitcoin Classic, as it seems to be a trade-off for both camps. And I'm generally not afraid of hard forks much; I'm even a proponent of regular hard forks \u2013 say, once a year \u2013 which would be able to reflect recent development in [the] field of cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nAnd the Bitcoin Roundtable signatories, in the end, did not completely exclude a switch to Bitcoin Classic at some point in the future either. If after three weeks the Bitcoin Core development team has not addressed concerns raised by the letter signatories, some of them might still opt to make a switch.\nBitFury's Petrov said:\n\n\u201cWe don't want to raise any aggression or conflicts with either the Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Classic development teams. Quite the opposite: We would like to build a communication bridge between them. We are just searching for the most optimal and efficient decision \u2013 between all voices and with the least risk. We already set the date for next meeting in the end of February, and we would like to discuss the issue with the Bitcoin Classic team to hear their perspective as well. Right now it seems more logical to roll-out Segregated Witness first, and prepare for a hard fork after that. But the Roundtable Group is comprised of many companies and people with differing views, and as initiators we don't want to make any decisions ourselves.\u201d\n", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 14}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nAs opposing sides in Bitcoin's long-lasting scaling dispute seem to be inching closer, one of the remaining sources of contention is not whether, but how to achieve a small block size bump.\nThe Bitcoin Core development team wants to increase the maximum block capacity through a Segregated Witness soft fork, which has since been embraced by a large part of Bitcoin\u2019s development community and a significant segment of the Bitcoin industry.\nOthers, like CEO of major payment processor BitPay Stephen Pair, believe the perceived benefits of soft forks over hard forks are being overstated.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Pair explained:\n\u201cI think soft forks aren't the panacea that many people perceive them to be. It's true that not all nodes on the network need to upgrade at the same time with a soft fork. But once the majority of hashing power has adopted new consensus rules, anyone running a full node should probably want to upgrade to validate the new transaction semantics. And this is especially true when you consider that SPV-nodes make the assumption that peers are performing full validation to keep miners in check.\u201d\n\u00a0A centerpiece of Bitcoin Core\u2019s scalability \u201croad map,\u201d Segregated Witness is set to increase the effective block size to some 1.6 megabytes to 2 megabytes by moving signature data into a new data structure. Pair is skeptical, however, that Segregated Witness should be considered a short-term scaling solution.\n\u201cSegregated Witness would completely change the structure of a Bitcoin transaction, and shouldn't be rushed,\u201d Pair said. \u201cIt needs a lot of time to be tested and widely supported. I'm not certain how contorted the implementation has to be to deploy it as a soft fork, but this is code we'll have to live with for a long time. The more complex the Bitcoin validation code becomes, the more vulnerable it will be to various types of attack. A cleaner implementation done as a hard fork might be preferable.\u201d\nOn Hard Forks\nPair himself initially signed an industry letter in support of BIP 101, the proposal by former Bitcoin Core lead developer Gavin Andresen intended to increase the block size limit to 8 megabytes, then doubling every other year for the next 20 years. He later said he preferred  Blockstream president Adam Back's \u201cBIP 248,\u201d an informal proposal to raise the limit to 8 megabytes over four years. And more recently, Pair pitched his own solution: a dynamic block size cap to automatically re-adjust based on recent transaction volume. Additionally, the BitPay CEO is willing to accept a one-time block size increase, such as a hard fork block size limit increase as proposed by Bitcoin Classic.\nPair did add, however, that a hard fork shouldn't be thought of too lightly:\n\u201cThe big risk of a hard fork is that non-upgraded nodes would go off on a defunct fork and they would be vulnerable to double-spend attacks. With a hard fork, you need to make sure people have plenty of time to upgrade. There is a need to come up with good engineering solutions to managing either type of fork; Version Bits as described in BIP-9 is a good start.\u201d\nOn Firm Forks\nAn alternative proposal to increase the block size limit is sometimes referred to as a \u201cfirm fork\u201d or a \u201csoft hardfork.\u201d This could allow a majority of miners to change any consensus rules, including those that would typically require a hard fork. But as opposed to both hard forks and soft forks, it would render non-upgraded nodes completely unable to detect any new transactions.\n\u201cWhile the additional complexity of implementing it may not be worth the effort, you could perform a hard fork where miners effectively DOS old nodes by merge mining empty blocks under the old consensus rules,\u201d Pair explained. \u201cI think that would make hard forks a lot safer. People will still have to upgrade, but for those that neglect to upgrade, it will be immediately apparent as it will seem that no transactions are being included in their chain.\u201d\nThis proposal has itself sparked some controversy, to the point where some dubbed it an \u201cevil soft fork.\u201d Since users would no longer be able to opt-out of a change, they'd have to follow the rules as decided on by miners \u2013 or create a new chain.\nPair is not too worried about these consequences, however:\n\u201cA user would either want to follow the longest chain, or explicitly go off on a weaker fork. Either way, he would need to upgrade. A firm fork would ensure that the old chain is no longer functional. But whether it's hard forks or soft forks or firm forks... the important thing is that we, as a community, need to become proficient at managing changes of consensus rules.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 11}

Digital Asset Holdings, the fintech startup headed by the financial superstar Blythe Masters, contributed its Hyperledger mark, which it had acquired in June with the purchase of San Francisco-based digital fintech company Hyperledger.\u00a0\nThe Hyperledger team, now part of Digital Asset Holdings, developed distributed ledger technology for private blockchains, without a built-in digital currency, to allow financial operators to clear and settle transactions in real time, using a proven consensus algorithm capable of thousands of transactions per second.\u00a0\nThe placeholder domain hyperledger.com now redirects to the official Hyperledger website hyperledger.org.\nThe updated list of Hyperledger founding members consists of 28 top companies in the technology and financial services space. It appears that the Linux Foundation\u2019s Hyperledger Project is moving very fast and is on its way to becoming a leading force in the blockchain technology development space.\u00a0\nFounded in 2000, the Linux Foundation wants to be the organization of choice for the world's top developers and companies to build ecosystems that accelerate open technology development and commercial adoption.\nThe technology of the original Hyperledger team is independent of Bitcoin, and many companies in the new Hyperledger Project support radical alternatives to Bitcoin. For example, Accenture and Digital Asset Holdings CEO Masters, among others, expressed support for private, \u201cpermissioned\u201d non-Bitcoin blockchains.\n\u201cTo be used by financial institutions, including capital markets firms and insurers, blockchains must supplant the costly methods introduced by Bitcoin with a mechanism that guarantees security, privacy and speed without paying for anonymous consensus,\u201d said two Accenture executives in July.\u00a0\nIn other words, Bitcoin should disappear and be replaced by a closed blockchain. So is Hyperledger a first step in that direction?\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to the Linux Foundation for clarifications and further explanations.\n\"The Linux Foundation believes a shared infrastructure that is open to critical inspection and collaboration will be pivotal in driving global adoption of blockchain for distributed ledgers,\" Linux Foundation executive director Jim Zemlin told Bitcoin Magazine. \"I\u2019m extremely bullish about how the developers involved in Hyperledger Project are openly looking at various architectures, concepts and technologies, aiming to integrate code from a variety of sources to build a neutral technology that can work for all.\"\nZemlin also answered some specific burning questions about the nature, plans and policies of the Hyperledger Project.\u00a0\nBitcoin Magazine: Does the Hyperledger Project support a specific (existing or planned) digital currency for payments and financial applications?\u00a0\nZemlin: No, the scope of the Hyperledger Project is limited to the development of the underlying blockchain fabric that can support a broad range of use cases. Applications and domain-specific frameworks are outside the scope of the project, but will obviously be encouraged to leverage the project's deliverables.\nBitcoin Magazine: Is the Hyperledger Project a replacement for Bitcoin and/or other existing cryptocurrencies?\nZemlin: This project\u2019s mission will be to build and advance a general purpose blockchain framework that can be used across industry sectors, from financial services to retail to manufacturing and more. There is ample room in the market for cryptocurrencies and even multiple implementations of the blockchain, but everyone stands to lose if these don\u2019t interoperate and work together. The hope would be that the fabric produced by the Hyperledger Project can satisfy a broad set of use case ranging from cryptocurrencies, supply-chain visibility, asset transfer, IoT, business contracts and so much more. We'll see thousands of applications and many uses cases, but open source and industry-wide collaboration are essential to realizing the full potential of distributed ledger technology.\u00a0\nBitcoin Magazine: Do you plan to implement full programmability with a Turing-Complete scripting language to support transactions and smart contracts of arbitrary complexity?\u00a0\nZemlin: One of the proposals on the table in the technical community supports execution of code written in any language. However, the community has not yet reached consensus on this point.\nBitcoin Magazine: What's your position on the privacy issue?\u00a0\nZemlin: It is important to realize that the Hyperledger Project is hosted by the Linux Foundation, but the community that has gathered to support and lend their resource and expertise to develop this key technology is just now coalescing and does not yet have a singular point of view.\nThe Hyperledger Project continues to unfold. Bitcoin Magazine will follow further developments.", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 10}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nAlthough Segregated Witness (SegWit) has near-universal support from the Bitcoin development community, there are some who say the changes required by individual wallet providers may be a bit too much to handle.\u00a0\nBut on a recent episode of Epicenter Bitcoin, Bitcoin Core Contributor and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo indicated that the complexities involved with these required changes have been overblown. While making his case for Segregated Witness, Lombrozo noted the Bitcoin wallet developers he\u2019s worked with have been able to implement this change in a matter of days.\nNot a Big Change\nLombrozo was asked how difficult it will be for wallet developers to implement Segregated Witness. The Ciphrex CEO talked about his own experience assisting wallet developers with the SegWit integration:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually not that big of a change. The wallet developers we\u2019ve worked with -- we\u2019re able to implement it within a couple of days, you know, less than a week. It is something that is not very, very difficult at all.\u201d\n\nLombrozo noted that there are some changes that will have to be made in wallets that wish to reap the benefits of SegWit, but these changes are minor. He explained:\n\u201cIt does require some changes. It\u2019s something that some people in the space have kind of -- were hoping that they wouldn\u2019t have to change anything -- but I think as far as changes go, this is a very, very minor change.\u201d\nLombrozo\u2019s comments on the difficulties of getting Segregated Witness to work with a particular wallet echo statements made by Blocktrail CTO and BitcoinJS co-maintainer Ruben de Vries in a recent interview with Bitcoin Magazine.\nThe Benefits of SegWit for Multisig Transactions\nIn addition to the relative simplicity of integrating SegWit into a wallet, Lombrozo also commented on the benefits of this new feature for multisig transactions. He explained:\n\n\u201cMultisig transactions with SegWit are much cleaner in a lot of ways. It allows us to stick the signatures into the structure in a way which is much, much cleaner than the way we\u2019re doing it right now. Also, with multisig transactions, the throughput increase is greater than with non-multisig transactions.\u201d\n\nThe second part of Lombrozo\u2019s statement has to do with Segregated Witness\u2019s ability to allow more transactions to be stuffed into blocks. Because multisig transactions involve more signatures, the space saved via SegWit is amplified.\nWallet Developers Have Incentives to Implement SegWit\nEric Lombrozo also pointed out in the Epicenter Bitcoin interview that Bitcoin wallet developers have economic incentives to upgrade to Segregated Witness. In short, users will demand the enhanced functionality offered by this alteration to how Bitcoin works. Lombrozo explained:\n\n\u201cYou want to upgrade to SegWit for all of the features that it offers. I think there\u2019s a lot of economic incentives built into this already. People are going to want to do it because it\u2019s makes it possible for them to give better products to their users.\u201d\n\nEpicenter Bitcoin co-host S\u00e9bastien Couture pointed out that the ability to fit more transactions into each block should also enable lower fees for wallet users. Lombrozo agreed with this assessment and added:\n\n\u201cIn principle, the transaction throughput itself in the block is going to be smaller -- miners can fit more of these transactions in a block. So yes, this means that fees, in principle, could be lower.\u201d\n\nHaving said that, Lombrozo somewhat backed off the notion of lower fees as a key feature of Segregated Witness over the short term because prioritization of transactions based on fees is not a major aspect of the Bitcoin network at this time.\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

The project is coordinated by\u00a0Oleksii Konashevych\u00a0and Gavid Kiziria.\u00a0The back end of already-functioning Ukrainian city council petition websites which are operated by KitSoft will be moved to the blockchain. In addition, Ambisafe is currently working on another online platform for nationwide elections and a mobile app.\nTo prevent voter fraud, E-vox will integrate multiple types of identity verification based on the poll or election, including government-issued digital signatures and bank-issued digital signatures called BankIDs, which are managed by Ukraine's three largest banks. Petitions and other less-strict types of polls will use phone number verification. National polls will use payment kiosks, found in bank branches and stores around Ukraine, to collect votes in person.\nIn a country that was torn apart by allegations of voter fraud and the subsequent protests, Ambisafe and E-vox are hoping to provide transparency for disenfranchised voters and make Ukraine the first to adopt a blockchain platform for both local and national elections.\n\u00a0\nPhoto\u00a0Perohanych\u00a0/ Creative Commons", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 16}

Unlike fiat currencies that can be printed at will by central banks, the total supply of bitcoins is fixed by the consensus rules of the system. Because of its deflationary nature, the digital currency is often compared to precious metals such as gold, which also undergo a resource-intensive creation or mining process.\nThis process of mathematically securing transactions in a block of chains called mining requires a tremendous supply of computing power and electricity. In exchange for securing the Bitcoin network and processing transactions, the protocol currently rewards these miners with 25 bitcoins for every block of transactions found. However, this reward for miners will soon be cut in half from 25 bitcoins to 12.5 bitcoins. This \u201chalving\u201d will occur at block 420,000, which is expected to be mined in the middle of 2016.\nSurge or Stability?\nThe decline of miner\u2019s reward simply means that the Bitcoin network will begin to generate bitcoins at a much slower rate. If the demand for bitcoin remains constant through the year while the supply is cut in half, simple economics dictates that the price should rise until there is a new equilibrium between supply and demand. Whether or not this supply change is already a factor in the price of bitcoin is a point of disagreement.\nSome argue that the Bitcoin community has been fully aware of the halving of miners\u2019 reward for a long time and that the actual decline in the supply of bitcoins will not surprise most Bitcoin enthusiasts and traders in the community.\nHistorically, halving of miner\u2019s reward has had no substantial effect on the price of Bitcoin. On November 28, 2012, the first time the miners\u2019 reward was halved, there was no visible impact on the value of Bitcoin, which was worth around USD $13.40 per bitcoin.\nThis occurred when block 210,000 was solved.\nConsidering the historical result of the \u201chalving day\u201d and the increasing awareness of Bitcoin, it is difficult to predict whether the price of Bitcoin will surge or maintain its stability after the halving of miner\u2019s reward.\nAs Bitcoin security expert and author of Mastering Bitcoin Andreas Antonopoulos explains, the impact of halving on the price of Bitcoin depends on a wide range of factors, including the difficulty and transaction volume of Bitcoin.\n\u201cI can't predict price. No one can. Anyone who does, even for 10 minutes, is lying,\u201d said Antonopoulos. \u201cThe reward halving will change the inflation rate in Bitcoin. How that affects the overall economy depends on the conditions of all the other parameters in the economy: price, adoption, transaction volume, hashrate, difficulty, investments, other currencies, world market conditions, etc.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 10}

Now, there is a new and improved model that is revolutionizing the way we build scalable applications called a DApp, or decentralized application.\u00a0\nDavid Johnston, CEO of the DApp Fund, predicts in his white paper that \u201cdecentralized applications will someday surpass the world\u2019s largest software corporations in utility, user-base, and network valuation due to their superior incentivization structure, flexibility, transparency, resiliency and distributed nature.\u201d\u00a0\nWhat Is a DApp?\nA DApp has four characteristics. It must be open source, with all changes made by a majority consensus of the user base. Data must be stored on a public blockchain to avoid a central point of failure. There must be a cryptographic token, referred to as an App Coin, to access the application, and these tokens must be issued according to a standard cryptographic algorithm acting as a proof of the value to nodes that contribute to the application.\nBitcoin is an example of a DApp, as it is an open-source token and uses the blockchain, a peer-to-peer and public distributed ledger, to form a trustless system. In fact, Bitcoin is the most popular DApp, as it simplifies many aspects of the traditional financial system, such as transferring money across the world.\u00a0\nAnother application of a DApp is something built as a protocol that uses another blockchain and its own token to function. An example is the Omni Protocol, which \u201cis a protocol built as a layer over Bitcoin that allows you to generate, send, trade, redeem, pay dividends to and make bets with tokens representing any kind of asset,\u201d said Patrick Dugan, who\u2019s a board member of the project, in an interview with Bitcoin.com.\u00a0\nAlternatively, a DApp can be built as an extension to the program. For example the SAFE Network, a peer-to-peer storage network, uses \u201csafecoins\u201d to operate the network. With the SAFE Network, decentralized applications are ensured complete data security, and there are projects such as SAFEpress, similar to WordPress, for the SAFE Network, to help people develop on the Network.\nImagine a DApp becoming the computer operating system (OSX or Windows), the programs used on the system (Photoshop, Dropbox), or specialized software that uses the programs, such as a blog that integrates Dropbox. Bitcoin is only the tip of the iceberg of what is possible with this new type of application.\nCan App Coins Have Value?\nDavid Johnston and team define App Coins in another white paper as \u201ctokens that are native to Decentralized applications that have a digital token associated with their use or monetization.\u201d\u00a0\nTokens can also be developed to behave in a way that Bitcoin cannot, at least for the time being. A Javascript-based programming library called Solidity and another Python-based library called Serpent allow decentralized applications to be built on Ethereum.\u00a0\nIn addition, networks can choose to operate exclusively with their network\u2019s coin, such as the safecoin that powers the SAFE Network. Doing anything on the SAFE Network requires safecoins, and developing on the SAFE Network provides additional value to developers.\u00a0\n\u201cI want to host my apps on SAFE and not have to worry about servers,\u201d said Francis Brunelle to Bitcoin Magazine. Brunelle is an app developer and enthusiastic community member who predicts that \u201csafecoins will be valuable because it will be the only way to buy storage space on the SAFE Network.\u201d\u00a0\nA strong user base on an application can be reinforced through a successful integration of App Coins. An application that rewards contributing developers and lead users with tokens that have a monetary value has an intrinsic advantage over one that does not. Furthermore, a large user base that uses an App Coin presents a barrier to exiting to a competing service with a less popular coin.\u00a0\nFinally, App Coins provide monetary choice as an alternative to both fiat currency and to Bitcoin. People have different opinions on monetary policies, especially with the rise of digital currencies. App Coins can adopt any number of monetary viewpoints and allow everyone a vote to their preferred economic policy.\nThe Consumer Future\nDApps will likely soon become \u201cconsumer apps,\u201d as there are already many in development. The Safe Network decentralizes Internet services and guarantees privacy to all Internet users. Ethereum provides a decentralized application layer and programming language for DApps to be developed.\u00a0\nFactom is a scalable data layer that simplifies big data management record-keeping. Augur is a decentralized prediction market that allows people to forecast events and be rewarded.\nAs Johnston says in Johnston\u2019s Law: \u201cEverything that can be decentralized, will be decentralized.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 13}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin mining today is dominated by mining pools. These mining pools arguably have a strong hold on the Bitcoin network, but also on their own participants. Since mining pools typically operate with little transparency, participants must issue a lot of trust in pool operators not to cheat them out of Bitcoin.\nCzech Republic-based Slush Pool \u2013 accounting for some 4 percent of total hash power on the Bitcoin network \u2013 now believes it has solved this problem. Its \u201cprovably fair\u201d mining should take away any mistrust \u2013 plus introduce some added benefits.\nA Quick Recap on Mining\nMiners are the entities on the Bitcoin network that confirm transactions and secure the network with hash power by finding Bitcoin blocks. These blocks include several types of data, most importantly transactions, but also the previous block header (linking blocks together), a timestamp and a random number called a \u201cnonce.\u201d\nUsing a mathematical trick called hashing, miners combine and scramble all of this data into an unpredictable random number called a hash, which is the \u201cblock header,\u201d identifying the block. The same data will always result in the exact same block header, but if even a tiny alteration is made to any of the data, it will result into a completely new hash.\nIf a miner hashes data ten times, odds are that one of these hashes starts with a zero. If a miner does it a hundred times, odds are one of them starts with two zeros. The Bitcoin network requires a valid block header to start with a certain amount of zeros: the difficulty factor.\nMiners essentially keep hashing potential blocks until they find a valid block, or one that meets the required difficulty.\nA Quick Recap on Pools\nMining pools \u2013 the first of which was Slush Pool back in 2010 \u2013 divide the work required to find blocks among all participants. A pool operator constructs a block, minus the nonce, and sends this block to all participants, called \u201chashers.\u201d (\u201cHashers\u201d are sometimes simply referred to as \u201cminers\u201d \u2013 but they don't do everything typical [solo] miners do.)\nHashers take the block as provided by the pool operator, and simply add a nonce to hash the bundle together. If any of the hashers finds a valid block, it sends this block to the pool operator, after which the pool redistributes the block reward among all connected hashers. (A hasher cannot keep the profit of the block for himself, as the coinbase transaction in the block is already attributed to the Bitcoin address controlled by the pool operator.)\nThe part of the block reward attributed to each hasher is based on his or her share of hash power contributed to the pool. This share, in turn, is calculated using \u201calmost valid\u201d blocks. If Bitcoin's difficulty requires valid blocks to start with 10 zeros, an \u201calmost valid\u201d block might start with nine zeros, or eight, or seven. Since hashers find these \u201calmost valid\u201d blocks more often, pool operators have a good idea of how much hash power each hasher contributes.\n(There is always a slight element of variance \u2013 luck \u2013 involved, as some hashers might randomly find a bit more almost-valid blocks than others. But as more almost-valid blocks are taken into account, this variance increasingly cancels out.)\nThe Problem: Pool Operator Control\nThe problem is that no one but the pool operator knows what percentage of hash power each hasher contributes. While hashers provide the pool operator with a certain amount of almost-valid blocks, they have no way of knowing how many \u201cof the blocks all other hashers found. They have to trust the mining pool to tell them what their share is.\nWell, almost. Hashers do know how much hash power they contributed to a pool, they can see how many blocks a pool found, and they can estimate how much total hash power is connected to the Bitcoin network based on how often blocks are found. As such, they can also estimate how much their mining pool contributes to the network, and therefore whether the pool is being honest.\nBut since pools \u2013 and smaller pools in particular \u2013 find only a certain number of blocks, it can take a long time to gather enough data to reliably draw a conclusion.\nThis uncertainty can be abused by dishonest pool operators. A pool operator could claim the total hash power is a bit higher than it really is, and that the pool is on an unlucky streak. He could then issue hashers too little share and skim some profit of the top for himself.\nLikewise, if an honest pool operator really does have an unlucky streak, hashers might falsely conclude the total hash power of their mining pool is lower than it really is -- and \u00a0falsely conclude their share is bigger than the pool operator claims it is.\nThe Solution: Publish the Blocks\nThe solution as introduced by Slush Pool is straightforward. Rather than keeping the almost- valid blocks for themselves, Slush Pool will publish them for anyone to see.\nSince it's easy to check whether these almost-valid blocks are indeed almost valid (meaning they did require hash power to produce), and due to the much lower impact of variance, it's impossible to fake the public list. And it becomes impossible for a pool operator to pretend the total hash power is more than it really is.\n(If hashers keep track of the almost-valid blocks they submit, they could also check whether these are included in the public list \u2013 though this shouldn't even be necessary.)\nAs an added benefit, this solution also offers more transparency, perhaps most interestingly regarding miner votes. With the introduction of Bitcoin XT, soon to be followed by Bitcoin Classic, Slush Pool was the only mining pool to allow individual hashers to vote on their preferred block size limit. But while hashers \u2013 and any other interested party \u2013 had to trust Slush Pool to actually attribute the right amount of hash power to the preference hashers desired, Slush Pool can now prove that it does.", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 11}

This allows individuals to determine exactly who is sending bitcoins and where they are sending them.\nIn a bid to provide a true anonymous service, the creators of the new digital currency Zcash say that identification of users will be virtually impossible to detect. Currently in its pre-release alpha testing stage, Zcash will rely on cryptographic algorithms, which are known as zero-knowledge proofs. This system presents users with the opportunity to prove they have the money without revealing their identities or the amounts they are intending to transact at any time, giving greater control to those who are concerned about their privacy when it comes to digital transactions.\nThe news came by way of Zcash, which said on its website:\n\n\u201cUnlike bitcoin, Zcash transactions automatically hide the sender, recipient, and value of all transactions on the block chain. Only those with the correct view key can see the contents. Users have complete control and can opt to provide others with their view key at their discretion.\u201d\n\nStart of Something New for Bitcoin\nIn 2014, Zcash creator, founder and CEO Zooko Wilcox initially proposed the theory in an academic paper. In that short time, the digital currency has come a long way with still plenty of work to be done before Zcash can mature into a complete open system.\nTo further cement the future of Zcash, Wilcox said in a forum post last week that the Zcash team hopes to have a live version of the digital currency available in July. In the meantime, those eager to learn more about the currency can play around with the alpha version on a \u201ctestnet\u201d network with a version of the currency that has no value at present.\nViable Choice for the Future?\nWilcox went on to say in a recent blog post that the added privacy would make Zcash the ideal choice for financial institutions and consumers to use compared to other digital currencies:\n\n\u201cCompanies need privacy in order to conduct their business. This is true for all sorts of companies, in all sorts of businesses.\u201d\n\nOther digital currencies have previously claimed to provide enhanced anonymity compared to Bitcoin. These currencies focus on the CryptoNote procedure, which supports ring signatures. It is these ring signatures, which are a type of digital signature, that makes it mathematically impossible to see which group of users performed a transaction. Another currency, Dash, claims to provide anonymity to users by combining unrelated transactions. This prevents observers from determining the sources and destinations of transactions.\nDespite these innovations, Bitcoin remains the most valuable digital currency by market cap and is also the most widely accepted digital currency.\nWilcox said that privacy helps to strengthen social ties and social institutions:\n\n\u201cWe believe that personal privacy is necessary for core human values like dignity, intimacy and morality. As we move more of our lives into the Internet, and integrate our lives more with the lives of people from around the globe, we want the new society we are building to be one of the peaceful and prosperous kind.\u201d\n", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 17}

Similar papers have been issued by other mainstream institutions.\nThe RAND Corporation, an influential global policy think tank with strong U.S. defense and homeland security ties, released a report titled \u201cNational Security Implications of Virtual Currency.\u201d A recent report issued by the U.K. Government Office for Science, titled \u201cDistributed ledger technology: beyond block chain,\u201d explores how distributed ledger technology can revolutionize public policies and advocates the use of blockchains for a variety of public services.\nA recent working paper released by the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD), titled \u201cHow Can Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Technology Play a Role in Building Social and Solidarity Finance?,\u201d explores the potential of distributed ledgers to help create a global world order fairer and more sustainable than the current one, and wonders \u00a0how blockchain technology can be harnessed for community empowerment and solidarity-based finance.\nThe UNRISD is an autonomous research institute within the U.N. system that undertakes multidisciplinary research and policy analysis on the social dimensions of contemporary development issues. The author of the UNRISD paper, Brett Scott, is an independent researcher and consultant on alternative finance and financial reform. Scott is the author of The Heretic\u2019s Guide to Global Finance: Hacking the Future of Money.\nAccording to Scott, it\u2019s important to test the potential of Bitcoin and blockchain technology for building truly empowering social and solidarity-based finance.\n\u201cThis paper provides a primer on the basics of Bitcoin and discusses the existent narratives about the technology\u2019s potential to facilitate remittances, financial inclusion, cooperative structures and even micro-insurance systems,\u201d says Scott. \u201cIt also flags up potential points of concern and conflict, such as the tech-from-above \u2018solutionism\u2019 and conservative libertarian political dynamics of some of the technology start-up community that surrounds Bitcoin. As a way of contrast the paper considers \u2018blockchain 2.0\u2019 technologies with more overtly communitarian ideals and their potential for creating \u2018cooperation at scale.\u2019\u201d\nScott suggests research on how blockchain technology could be implemented with sensitivity to the real struggles people face in implementing technology within diverse cultural and political contexts.\n\u201cOne blockchain does not fit all,\u201d notes Scott.\nIn particular, he suggests a research effort, presumably conducted under the leadership of the UNRISD, on the extent to which developing countries are actually adopting blockchain technology, the extent to which cryptocurrencies could interact with \u201cblockchain 2.0\u201d smart-contract technology to create alternative financial schemes, and the Bitcoin system\u2019s potential to promote financial inclusion, including its use as a remittance system and as an alternative bank account.\nFor example, blockchain-based property title systems (such as land registries) could open up normal bank financing to people who otherwise cannot get access to credit from financial institutions.\nThe popular technology magazine Motherboard notes that \u201cmost Bitcoin startups are just too damn libertarian to take up the altruistic challenge of helping less privileged people,\u201d according to Scott. \u201cBut there is some hope that Bitcoin\u2019s underlying blockchain technology\u2026 might actually help developing economies.\u201d\nScott describes the \u201ctechno-libertarian\u201d message as \u201ca technology-as-saviour and markets-as-saviour gospel alongside an anti-state message,\u201d and outlines the disruptive potential of smart contracts and Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAOs).\nIt is, however, possible to build a communitarian anarchist reading of the same technology. Scott suggests de-emphasizing the focus on the trustless nature of blockchains, and instead characterize blockchain technology as trust-enabling.\nScott mentions Bitnation, a blockchain-based \u201cGovernance 2.0\u201d initiative with a collaborative platform for DIY governance, as one of the most radical articulations of the techno-libertarian message, and quotes two Bitcoin Magazine articles (1, 2) about Bitnation.\nLed by Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, Bitnation launched several pathfinders and proofs of concept including the first marriage registered on the blockchain and the first blockchain passport. The organization also developed and tested, as suggested by Scott in the U.N. paper, workable DIY land titles recorded on the blockchain in Ghana, where 70 percent of land lacks proper title, preventing investment and borrowing in real property markets.\n\u201cBitnation has presented a vision -- at least in principle -- of hosting completely alternative state institutions (such as security and legal institutions) on blockchain systems, describing states as governance service providers that might be outcompeted by technological platforms,\u201d says Scott.\nAt the same time, persuaded that that modern democratic states can represent the interests of all, Scott prefers a mixed, socially oriented \u00a0\u201clibertarian socialist\u201d approach to the pure \u201cstateless\u201d libertarian model promoted by Bitnation.\n\u00a0\nPhoto\u00a0Tom Page\u00a0/ Flickr(CC)\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 16}

Instead of anonymous miners, only banks and vetted financial operators would be allowed to validate transactions in permissioned blockchains.\n\u201cTo be used by financial institutions, including capital markets firms and insurers, blockchains must supplant the costly methods introduced by Bitcoin with a mechanism that guarantees security, privacy and speed without paying for anonymous consensus,\u201d said two Accenture executives in July. \u201cWith private chains, you can have a completely known universe of transaction processors,\u201d Digital Asset Holdings CEO Blythe Masters said in September. \u201cThat appeals to financial institutions that are wary of the bitcoin blockchain.\u201d\nOther experts, including legendary cryptographer Nick Szabo, strongly argued that financial operators should, instead, embrace the crowd-sourced power and resiliency of permissionless blockchains like Bitcoin.\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Treat to find out more about Accenture\u2019s position in the permissionless vs. permissioned blockchain debate.\n\"Permissionless blockchain solutions were driven by the desire to transfer value \u2013 whether cryptocurrency or other digital assets \u2013 without the need for a trusted third-party,\u201d Treat told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThat has tremendous power, but also distinct limits in terms of use cases and scalability. \u00a0Permissioned blockchain solutions tip the dynamic towards groups of known actors who can message, transfer, and validate transactions in a number of ways with the necessary controls (e.g. AML/KYC). They are less constrained by latency and scalability challenges, which opens a multitude of opportunities for financial institutions to remove inefficiencies.\"\n\u201cPermissioned-based solutions enable faster and more scalable consensus mechanisms because the nodes are controlled by known chosen actors,\u201d added Treat. \u201cIn a permissioned environment, the ledger can be engineered along a much wider array of consensus mechanisms, including multi-signature, Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant, Proof of Stake, Zero Knowledge Proof, etc.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPhoto\u00a0Michael Gray\u00a0/\u00a0Flickr", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 18}

The company is deploying a Blockchain-As-A-Service offering for developers.\u00a0\nUsing the new blockchain services available on IBM\u2019s open standards cloud applications platform Bluemix, developers can create, deploy, run and monitor blockchain applications on the IBM Cloud. Blockchain applications can also be deployed on IBM z Systems high performance mainframe computers.\n\"Blockchain is about reimagining some of the most fundamental processes we use every day, from supply chain to trade settlement,\u201d Jerry Cuomo, IBM vice president of Blockchain Technologies, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe want customers to focus on the potential use cases. The cloud helps remove any of the technological barriers that IT puts in place so organizations can spend more time developing business solutions. Using IBM\u2019s new blockchain services on Bluemix, the developer could instantly be running a fully configured blockchain environment so they can focus on creating applications.\" \u00a0\nThe Wall Street Journal notes that IBM is becoming the biggest backer of blockchain technology, and taking a leading role in the development of innovative, next-generation blockchain applications beyond Bitcoin.\u00a0\n\u201cI think the number of places that a distributed ledger can be used could become almost limitless,\u201d said Arvind Krishna, senior vice president of IBM Research, and mentioned applications to coordinating back-end systems for supply chains, tracking stock or real-estate ownership and settling international financial transactions.\u00a0\n\u201cIBM\u2019s vision for making blockchain a powerful new business solution across multiple industries is becoming a reality as our clients begin piloting innovative new code, services and z Systems optimized for distributed ledgers,\u201d said Krishna. \u201cThese advancements are making it easier for developers to move from understanding the potential of blockchain, to actually using it to change their business processes in powerful new ways.\u201d\nThe tech giant is making nearly 44,000 lines of code available to the Linux Foundation\u2019s open source Hyperledger Project to help developers easily build secure distributed ledgers that can be used to exchange most anything of value. IBM is persuaded that Hyperledger could make blockchain-based services faster, more scalable and easier to use, and expects Hyperledger software to provide special advantages for owners of IBM hardware, said Krishna.\nIBM\u2019s blockchain code includes a new consensus algorithm developed by IBM Research, tailored to specific blockchain use cases, and advanced identity management features. The pluggable architecture of IBM\u2019s code allows developers to use software modules (consensus module for example) that best suits their needs, and write smart contracts in popular programming languages \u2013 such as Java or Golang. Fine-grained privacy and confidentiality control allows authors of smart contracts to precisely specify both who can view them and who can execute them.\nIBM and Japan Exchange Group (JPX), Japan\u2019s largest stock exchange, announced an agreement to test the potential of blockchain technology in low transaction markets. IBM will work with JPX to jointly evaluate how the IBM open source code blockchain code could be used for trading and settlement in low liquidity markets.\u00a0\nAs the Hyperledger Project evolves, the joint IBM and JPX evaluation work will transition to use of the code produced by that effort. IBM is also working with the London Stock Exchange Group to enable the creation of solutions that will help manage risk and bring additional transparency to global financial markets.\nIBM is expanding its blockchain consulting practice for the financial services and logistics industries, and will open IBM Garages focused on blockchain technology in London, New York, Singapore and Tokyo. IBM Interactive Experience (iX), which according to IBM is the largest digital agency network worldwide, will support clients in the creation of new business models based on blockchain technology.\n\u201cIBM blockchain is open for business,\u201d states the IBM Blockchain website. \u201cLearn how blockchain will fundamentally change the way we do business. Then let us help you give it a try.\u201d\nWith the momentum around blockchain growing exponentially, and interest shifting beyond financial services to its potential as a game-changing initiative for other industries, IBM is claiming a leadership role. The Wall Street Journal notes that IBM\u2019s entrance into the nascent blockchain market will push more large companies into testing the technology.", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 17}

BEN organizes cross-campus events, local and global hackathons, and provides educational resources for students starting a new chapter on their campus. Bitcoin Magazine caught up with Dean Masley, the executive director of BEN, to talk about the reason behind their rebranding and their plan for the upcoming year.\nBitcoin Magazine: So the College Cryptocurrency Network (CCN) recently rebranded to the Blockchain Education Network (BEN). Can you talk a bit about the reason for the change?\nDean Masley: The reason that we wanted to change to the Blockchain Education Network is to reflect the changes of the industry. We changed Cryptocurrency to Blockchain because the scope of the industry has gotten broader. Cryptocurrency implies that it only has something to do with money and transactions. We changed from College to Education because we had a problem with turnover in that people who graduated didn\u2019t have a clear way to continue their relationship and role with the network. We started with college because it created a great community for college leaders, but now we want to better encompass kids that are in high school, students in university, kids who dropped out to work on their startup or recent graduates who are still interested in participating in the blockchain education movement. Also, it was time for a change. Our old logo and branding was from 2 years and and since then our network has matured greatly and it was time for an update.\nBitcoin Magazine: How does the network look now in terms of membership?\u00a0\nDean Masley: We adjusted our signup process to make it extremely easy for high school students and undergrads to join our community. If they reach out we invite them to our private community, and once they graduate to become alumni they are able to stick around.\nGraduates who wish to participate can reach out, we speak with them, and we invite those that add opportunity and value to our youth network. This process has been successful in creating an active youth community that shares disruptive education ideas for their clubs. Everyone uses their real name and students add a picture of their face and what school they go to along with other ways to contact them to easily get in touch with the student leaders in the network.\nWe have a lot of activity from the Bitcoin clubs on the East Coast and West Coast and in Canada and we have a small, but growing, participation of students from Asia and Europe.\nBitcoin Magazine: How are campuses collaborating?\nDean Masley:  We create an environment where students can easily open a dialogue with student leaders they see on popular Bitcoin news sites doing cool things at their university campuses across the world. We help students bring the success stories they see on the news to their own campus and are able to reach out directly to student leaders in our private community to make that happen.\u00a0\nWe are also creating events that encourage students in Bitcoin and blockchain clubs to collaborate with each other more often so that Generation Blockchain becomes aware of all the other clubs and what they are doing so cool ideas propagate faster. For example, we\u2019re launching Blockchain Madness in March that puts 3 campuses in the United States and 3 campuses in Canada against each other in an elimination blockchain trivia tournament. While very competitive, this will create a dialogue between these communities, motivate student clubs to rally behind a common goal, and encourage future cross-campus collaboration.\nBitcoin Magazine:  Which campuses are participating in Blockchain Madness and how were they chosen?\nDean Masley:  We picked campuses that host active Bitcoin/blockchain clubs and wish to show their prowess on the international stage. Some of the clubs like MIT, Berkeley and the University of Toronto, are established already, while the others are up-and-coming and excited to get more involved. In the same way that March Madness makes college basketball teams look like all stars and rallies support from the alumni, we wish to shine a similar spotlight on Bitcoin/blockchain clubs.\nBitcoin Magazine:  What other events are being planned for the rest of 2016?\nDean Masley: We love the success that students from the MIT Bitcoin Club and McGill Cryptocurrency Club have had with the Bitcoin Airdrops, and we want to replicate that type of event globally. We will keep creating new types of events like this for campuses to collaborate.\u00a0\nAlso we are planning a global monthlong hackathon in April to continue our success from what we saw in November with the Borderless Block Party hackathon.\nBitcoin Magazine:  Anything else you want to share?\nDean Masley:  A lot of people don\u2019t really understand what our network is. Imagine this: When you hang out with friends in real life, you can talk about topics and current events that come up spontaneously. With Blockchain technology this is more difficult since people around you don\u2019t know enough about it to have a serious discussion.\u00a0\nWith our global network though, you can hang out in a big room with all your friends together and geek out on Blockchain.\u00a0\nThrough the Internet, our generation has tremendous power to change the world. We can create teams with a global talent pool and payroll, create services used in markets across the world and react quickly to problems in the world. We are building the expectation for participating in a global economic market with global opportunities. And put simply, once we enter the \u201creal world\u201d after university, traditional finance won\u2019t be able to meet our expectations for our global problem-solving needs.\u00a0\nIf you would like to get in touch with the youth blockchain education movement, you can get in touch on the website, BlockchainEdu.org.\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 19}

The video of the Bitnation Constitution launch event, promoted on Facebook as \u201cCreate Your Own Nation In 140 Lines Of Code,\u201d was streamed live and is now online on YouTube.\nBitnation launched several pathfinders and proofs of concept including the first marriage registered on the blockchain and the first blockchain passport. The organization also developed and tested workable DIY land titles recorded on the blockchain in Ghana, where 70 percent of land lacks proper title, preventing investment and borrowing in real property markets. In November, Bitnation partnered with the Estonian government to offer a public notary service to Estonian e-residents based on blockchain technology.\nIn a recent U.N. working paper covered by Bitcoin Magazine, Brett Scott, the author of The Heretic\u2019s Guide to Global Finance: Hacking the Future of Money, praised Bitnation\u2019s pioneering work on blockchain-based land-titles. \u201cBitnation has presented a vision \u2013 at least in principle \u2013 of hosting completely alternative state institutions (such as security and legal institutions) on blockchain systems, describing states as governance service providers that might be outcompeted by technological platforms,\u201d he noted.\nAt the same time, Scott, whose vision is centered on a communitarian, social-libertarian approach, criticized Bitnation\u2019s vision of a future stateless society as an extreme techno-libertarian position. According to Scott, modern democratic states can represent the interests of all.\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Tarkowski Tempelhof and asked about her reactions to Scott\u2019s paper.\n\"The left-versus-right-wing libertarian debate is rather pointless, in my opinion, because on a free market for governance, you can choose whichever economic model you prefer,\u201d said Tarkowski Tempelhof. \u201cFor instance, you can choose to live in a communist commune like a Kibbutz will full economic redistribution, or a capitalist city like Hong Kong or Singapore centered around trade, commerce and private companies. Or you could choose a combination of the two. Having a free market doesn't imply any specific economic model.\"\nHere Tarkowski Tempelhof, a globetrotter who moves around the planet a lot and can feel at home everywhere, is proposing to do away with geographically localized nation states and replace them with distributed opt-in governance systems. Her vision is very appealing to techno-libertarians and fans of John Perry Barlow\u2019s manifesto \u201cA Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace,\u201d which was cited at the launch event in Rio de Janeiro. Of course, the devil is in the details: how to peacefully handle a dispute between persons who subscribe to different, independent distributed governance systems?\n\u201cThe reputation system acts as an incentive mechanism to solve disputes,\u201d answers Tarkowski Tempelhof. \u201cHence, if we have different legal codes, we are incentivized to agree upon one legal code and arbitrator for the specific dispute. If one of the parties refuse to cooperate to solve the dispute, it will be reflected in their reputation. And if people create an unnecessary amount of disputes, being a time and energy drain on other people, that will also be reflected in the reputation.\u201d\nOne of the strongest objections to technocracy made by Scott in the U.N. paper is that smart contracts defined by algorithms alone without human mediation can be too inflexible.\u00a0\n\"Contracts are representations of frequently ambiguous, unpredictable and messy relationships between imperfect humans with imperfect knowledge,\u201d says Scott. \u201cSuch relationships cannot easily be pre-programmed, and much of the work of lawyers involves resolving and interpreting contracts in light of changing realities. Building systems that seek to move away from such politicized negotiation can sound utopian, but might equally lead to situations of inflexible technocracy.\u201d\n\"To say that technology is inflexible, and not always adapted to human nature, is an important point to take into account,\u201d concedes Tarkowski Tempelhof. \u201cWe shouldn't attempt to pre-program more than what's needed.\n\u201cRather, all laws should compete on a free market, and be subject to the same reputation as people are, or nations or holons are,\u201d is the solution that Tarkowski Tempelhof proposes. \u201cThat way, people can choose the law that fits them best, in each individual situation. In addition to temporary, reputation-based laws, Bitnation is also developing a platform with a significant human focus \u2013 core to our service proposition is using human arbitrators, and flexible, soft coded contracts done intuitively by all participants in the agreement.\u201d\nBitcoin Magazine asked Tarkowski Tempelhof to summarize her long-term, 50-plus-year vision for Bitnation.\n\u201cI believe the nation state oligopoly is being phased out naturally, due to the forces of globalization, and we\u2019re obviously trying to help fast-forward that process,\u201d says Tarkowski Tempelhof. \u201cBut the question is what comes after it? Everything indicates it will be replaced by an even worse one-fit-all governance model, like the U.N., which will lead to perpetual war between people who simply wish to live life as they want, with their own legal code, their own lifestyle. Bitnation counters that dystopian future through creating an open-source nation model, that everyone can fork, to create their own nation. We believe we\u2019ll make both nation states governments, as well as organizations like the U.N. irrelevant, simply through providing cheaper, more secure and better Do-It-Yourself governance services.\u201d\nAnticipating that many techno-libertarian readers will find Bitnation\u2019s vision energizing and wonder how to join, we asked Tarkowski Tempelhof how to become a citizen of Bitnation, and what is expected from Bitnation citizens.\n\u201cYou have to sign on the constitution, and you have to own some cryptoequity (though owning cryptoequity doesn\u2019t automatically make you a citizen),\u201d explains Tarkowski Tempelhof. \u201cYou can get cryptoequity either through buying it, or earning it through contributing with work. The equity pays you profit dividend. Later on we\u2019ll enable a system where people can contribute with computing power as well, as the computing power of its citizens is basically the closest thing a virtual nation has to a natural resource, in the same way a nation state has gas or oil. It\u2019s important to note, however, that you don\u2019t need to be a citizen of Bitnation to use our services. Being a citizen only means contributing to Bitnation\u2019s development, and getting dividend in return.\u201d\nThe Bitnation Constitution is online on Github.", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 19}

Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said in a statement.\nForbes has argued the currency has not been that anonymous, as each transaction has been documented on the blockchain. But a spokesperson for the E.C. said the public ledgers were not transparent enough.\n\u201cIndeed, public ledgers offer traceability to transactions between accounts,\u201d press officer Letizia Lupini explained. \u201cHowever, these accounts remain anonymous. This anonymity is potentially an incentive for unlawful activities.\u201d\nRegulators and advocacy groups have said more education is needed, not regulation.\nJason Weinstein, director of the Blockchain Alliance, told Bitcoin Magazine that restrictions were not the solution.\n\u201cCriminals and terrorists are using all sorts of technology to try to hide their activities over the Internet, but those who turn to Bitcoin as part of that effort are making a big mistake,\u201d he said.\nDavid Long, principal and senior consultant at the Northern California Fraud Prevention Solutions, said it would be easier to launder euros than bitcoins, \u201cThough from an initial investigative standpoint, bitcoins might present more of a challenge due to the necessity of uncovering who is actually responsible for a given transaction or transactions.\n\u201cHowever, once the actor's identity is uncovered, the blockchain makes it possible to uncover most, if not all, of a person's transactions,\u201d Long said. \u201cThis capability is without parallel when the subject is dealing in euros or dollars.\u201d\nBitcoin was called the \u201csingle, common currency for cybercriminals within the E.U.,\u201d in a 2015 report by Europol.

Most exchanges today are already following KYC/AML procedures,\u201d virtual currency expert Michael Yeung said.\nThere has also been concern about what tougher regulations could mean for small businesses working in Bitcoin.\n\u201cRegulation is desirable and required, but regulation that is too onerous may end up destroying legitimate businesses in their infancy,\u201d blockchain researcher and consultant at CryptolQ, Albert Szmigielski said.\nWeinstein, director of the Blockchain Alliance, has warned in a Forbes article that complex regulation may pave the way for a black market takeover.\n\u201cRegulators should appreciate the fact that most of the Bitcoin companies are startups and do not have a lot of resources,\u201d he said. \u201cThe simpler the landscape of compliance rules, the better it is for not only the companies but also the public for whom the regulations are there to protect.\u201d\nThe new rules will be announced by the end of June.

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nBitcoin Core contributor and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo was recently interviewed on Epicenter Bitcoin, and he used a portion of his time to explain some misconceptions and misunderstandings related to the block size limit debate.\u00a0\nWhile the focus of this development controversy has mainly centered on the actual block size metric in the Bitcoin protocol, Lombrozo says this misses the main point of disagreement. In his view, a hard fork is what the Bitcoin Core development community would like to avoid over the short term.\nThe Hard Fork Is the Issue\nWhen explaining the full picture of the block size debate, Lombrozo made the point that the non-technical Bitcoin community (likely a reference to Bitcoin subreddits) may not have had the full picture of what was going on in the development community back in May of 2015. Lombrozo described the debate that took place among developers during this period of time:\n\n\u201cI think that a lot of the non-technical community and the public were not really witnessing exactly the whole development as far as what the developers were doing. Way back in May, we were already talking about considering these ideas when it was first proposed to the mailing list, and people were actually really trying to pick this apart and figure out all the things that could possibly go wrong. It quickly became apparent that hard forks have very significant stability issues, they can potentially open up attack vectors, and it could be very dangerous for the network.\u201d\n\nAlthough progress has been made on the simplicity of soft fork deployments, hard forks are still hard. At the recent Blockchain Agenda Conference in San Diego, Lombrozo detailed BIP 9, which allows for several new features to be applied to Bitcoin via simultaneous soft forks.\nContentious Hard Forks Should Be Avoided\nGetting deeper into the problems with hard forks, Lombrozo made it clear that such changes to Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules are not impossible. Instead, he said contentious hard forks are the ones that should be avoided. Lombrozo noted:\n\n\u201cI am very concerned about hard forks. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s impossible to do a hard fork more safely, [but] I think the only way that\u2019s viable is if there isn\u2019t this kind of contentiousness \u2013 if you don\u2019t have a lot of polarization and people kind of fighting over different things. If most of the network agrees on something \u2013 if something is pretty much uncontroversial \u2013 that\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nBitcoin Classic is a new implementation of the Bitcoin protocol with an increased block size limit of 2 megabytes. This change in the block size limit would require a hard fork, and it is enabled 28 days after 750 of the last 1,000 blocks have been found by miners who support the increase.\u00a0\nMany Bitcoin Core contributors find this hard fork to be contentious and would like to see something in the 90 to 95 percent social consensus range. Although an intentional hard fork has never been attempted on the Bitcoin network (Note: One change implemented in 2010 and activated in 2012 had implications somewhat similar to a hard fork), 95 percent approval from miners has been the standard for past soft forks.\nWe All Want Bigger Blocks\nLombrozo said everyone would like to see the Bitcoin network scale via an increased block size limit. He explained:\n\n\u201cAs far as the block size itself, I don\u2019t think there was much issue with bigger blocks. I don\u2019t think many of the Core developers actually said, \u2018No, we should never have bigger blocks.\u2019 I think, for the most part, the idea of having bigger blocks is something that is appealing. We should find a way to have bigger blocks; we all want bigger blocks. But just increasing the blocks by changing a constant in the code presents a lot of very, very serious problems.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Bitcoin Core contributors would like to see a solution to the block size limit issue that does not involve a contentious hard fork.\nSegregated Witness Is the Best of Both Worlds\nUntil recently, the concept of increasing the block size limit while also avoiding a hard fork was theoretical. Bitcoin Core Developer Pieter Wuille presented Segregated Witness (SegWit) at the Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong Workshop to near-universal acclaim. Lombrozo described how this solution provides developers with the best path forward:\n\n\u201cIt turns out, if we want to do this and do it safely, we probably have to retrofit some stuff and do a lot more risk mitigation, which is what we\u2019re trying to do with this. With SegWit, we kind of get the best of both worlds. I mean yes, it\u2019s not a single, constant change in the code \u2013 it does require a bit of modification to applications \u2013 but it\u2019s not a very significant modification. And it\u2019s much safer from all of the other aspects of it. It really does not cause all of the stability issues that just changing this constant does.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nSome detractors of the SegWit soft fork have noted the changes to Bitcoin wallets required by this proposal are too cumbersome, but Lombrozo said that the wallet developers he\u2019s worked with have been able to implement the required changes in a few days. The Bitcoin Core website also lists the wallet providers who plan to support SegWit.\nThe Soft Fork Is Almost Like a No-Brainer\nIn Lombrozo\u2019s view (and Bitcoin Core\u2019s view according to their roadmap), the Segregated Witness soft fork is nearly a no-brainer. The Ciphrex CEO explained:\n\n\u201cBlock size was never really the issue; that was never really what people were arguing about. It was much more about this hard fork thing \u2013 whether we should do a hard fork or not. Now that we have a soft fork way to do it, it\u2019s almost like a no-brainer.\u201d\n\nLombrozo went on to say that there is general consensus among the Bitcoin Core development community that the network cannot handle blocks much bigger than 2 megabytes right now. This means a hard fork to anything over 2 megabytes would likely not gain social consensus among Bitcoin Core contributors.

The hospital\u2019s network was under attack for 11 days (February 5-15 ) before Stefanek paid the ransom.\u00a0\nWhile headlines jested about a hospital staff reverting back to pre-1990s procedures when paper and pen were the data medium of the day, a technological regression on this order, when lives are at stake, required a calculation. Stefanek and the hospital had to decide whether people\u2019s lives were worth 40 bitcoins.\u00a0\nUltimately, HPMC calculated their losses and liability and paid. This type of Bitcoin-based ransomware has been on the rise since 2013 when it is estimated that more than 200 malware programs were being released every minute of that year.\u00a0\nInitially, there was CryptoLocker, the ransomware that demanded about $300 in bitcoins from the personal computer user before wiping their hard drives. In early 2015, security companies McAfee and Symantec warned of the CTB-Locker (Curve Tor Bitcoin Locker). This elliptical curve encryption ransomware, spread through spam campaigns, locks users out of their files. Paying a Bitcoin ransom is the only way to retrieve the 3,072-bit key.\u00a0\nAs of January 2016, hackers have been deploying ransomware against websites to shake them down as well. Reports estimate that malware-as-service is now becoming one of the fastest growing trades on the darknet markets. The FBI assumes that there are around 200 hackers responsible for the current malware fiasco.\u00a0\nAs more attacks are launched against personal computer users, websites, and even hospitals, the numbers of Bitcoin related ransomware attacks that are paid will increase, with the HPMC serving as a example for other hackers. \u00a0\nThe comparatively paltry sum of 40 bitcoins recently ransomed from HPMC represents a new iteration in the morphing nature of ransomware targets: soft targets that have excellent insurance and will be inoperable without access to their data.\u00a0\nBy asking for a reasonable sum, the hackers are forcing the victims to pay the ransom and write off the cost as an operation expense. Stefanek explains in the letter, \u201cThe quickest and most efficient way to restore our systems and administrative functions was to pay the ransom and obtain the decryption key.\u00a0 In the best interest of restoring normal operations, we did this.\u201d\u00a0\nA move like this can create potential liabilities in the future for HPMC because targets that pay the ransom are often retargeted, but it was imperative that the hospital have its EMR (Electronic Medical Record) service operable.\u00a0\nThe simplest solution to the problem is that systems, sites and files should all be backed up in secure locations offline as a fail safe against attack. Such services exist, but individuals and organizations typically don't think to use them until an attack already has occurred.\u00a0\nSome believe entities such as hospitals should be required by law to be more responsible with patient data.\u00a0\nSimilar security weaknesses were exposed following the hack of Target\u2019s TGT security and payments system in 2013. After that hack, consumers became aware of how lackadaisical the retail giant had been with their customer\u2019s data. Increased Bitcoin ransomware attacks could result in resiliency in the area of Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cuntraceability\u201d and of private data management systems.\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 19}

Such notes are the preferred payment mechanism of those pursuing illicit activities, given the anonymity and lack of transaction record they offer, and the relative ease with which they can be transported and moved. By eliminating high denomination, high value notes we would make life harder for those pursuing tax evasion, financial crime, terrorist finance and corruption.\u201d \u2013 Peter Sands\nThe report states that illegal money flows exceed $2 trillion annually, with the majority of the transactions deriving from the purchases of illicit goods such as drugs and weapons. Sands further emphasizes that high value currencies play a minimal role in the functioning of an economy, yet a significant role in the underground economy.\nGlobal Financial Integrity (GFI), which produces high-caliber analyses of illicit financial flows and advises developing country governments on effective policy solutions, estimates that in 2013, illicit financial flows from developing countries totaled $1.1 trillion, recording a staggering, 275 percent increase since early 2004.\nWhile GFI and Sands estimate that trillions of U.S. dollars are spent by terrorist groups, corrupt politicians and banks to smuggle cash through borders, they believe that electronic payment mechanisms such as Bitcoin are more efficiently used to settle transactions.\n\u201cIn the underground economy, the reverse is true. High denomination notes are the payment instrument of choice for those evading taxes, committing crimes, financing terrorism or giving or receiving bribes. Cash offers anonymity, leaves no transaction record and is universally accepted. High denomination notes are the form of cash which enable large sums to be paid, moved and stored with minimum cost and detection risk. From the criminals\u2019 perspective, high denomination notes are far more attractive than bank transactions, Bitcoin, gold or diamonds.\u201d \u2013 Peter Sands\n\nAs demonstrated by the graph provided by Sands above, cash, diamonds and gold are the only truly anonymous forms of money in existence today. Because of the lack of mobility in gold and diamonds, cash has been the highly preferred method of payment over the last few decades. Because of its low transaction cost, immediacy of value transfer, complete anonymity and untraceability, nearly $1 trillion worth of fiat money is used by corrupt politicians and financial organizations annually.\u00a0\nEvery year, the World Bank Group\u2019s Enterprise Surveys conducts an international survey with more than 130,000 firms across 135 countries, to evaluate and establish the level of corruption and bribery involved with governments and federal agencies. According to their newly released corruption data, around 17.2 percent of companies and organizations around the world have experienced at least one bribe payment request in recent years. Moreover, Enterprise Surveys stated that the around 26.1 percent of the companies were required to bribe government officials or agencies to secure contracts.\nSands explains that the elimination of high value currencies and the implementation of popular electronic payment mechanisms, such as Bitcoin, could significantly reduce bribery and government corruption worldwide.\u00a0\nSince some extremely high denomination notes have been eliminated in recent years, such as Canada\u2019s $1,000 notes and Singapore\u2019s $10,000 note, Sands believes that his proposal is reasonable, considering the rising levels of financial fraud and money laundering.\n\u201cElectronic payment mechanisms continue to become more available, accepted, flexible and cost-effective. Since most people in most countries already use such alternatives rather than high denomination notes when they make high value payments, they clearly work. Given these technological advances, high denomination notes are no longer required to facilitate the smooth functioning of the legitimate economy.\u201d \u2013 Peter Sands\nSince most currencies, such as the euro, have several high denomination notes including the \u20ac500, \u20ac200 and \u20ac100 note, Sands and his team of researchers are proposing the governing body eliminate the highest note first, observe the effect, and remove the others from the financial system over the next few years.\nAs large currency notes become eliminated, both commercial and central banks would lose some seignorage income and thus, leading financial organizations and banking groups will most probably reject Sands\u2019 proposal.\u00a0\nSeignorage income is the revenue for a government when the money that is created is worth more than it costs to produce it. However, some financial experts worry that implementing the elimination of high value currency notes to reduce the number of payments related to crimes and fraudulent activities may lead banking institutions and financial establishments to become even more corrupt, as they would seize the power to process and settle fraudulent transactions for corrupt organizations and individuals without any evidence to trace the transactions.\nPhoto\u00a0401kcalculator.org\u00a0/ Flickr(CC)", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 22}

A thousand battles, a thousand victories.\u201d - Sun Tzu, The Art of War\nAnyone with experience in extended, unconventional conflict should be able to recognize current patterns in the Bitcoin and digital currency space that resemble subversive activity.\nIs a game of social engineering being leveled at the Bitcoin community? Based on open source information alone, it\u2019s conceivable that certain individuals or teams are trying \u00a0to demoralize and disrupt the Bitcoin ecosystem.\u00a0\nThis article won\u2019t definitively answer the question; it will present a thought experiment about how a \u201cred\u201d team would arrange itself going up against the Bitcoin ecosystem, with some examples that demonstrate the tactics. Readers can draw their own conclusions.\nBefore charging ahead, it might be helpful to know whose thought experiment you are reading. I graduated from the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School in Fort Bragg, North Carolina with a major in Unconventional Warfare and minor in Engineering. I spent some time as a Special Forces Intelligence Sergeant on a deployment to Iraq, which could be compared to high-octane detective work with the possibility of firefights. The detective work was focused on identifying personas and connecting the dots between events, actions and resources.\nIf I were a person who wanted to bring down Bitcoin, in other words, the following is how I\u2019d go about it.\nBy sharing the simplicity of this sort of disruptive activity, I hope to help raise the level of community awareness, and slow the speed and efficiency of any potential disruption. Being aware that you\u2019re being exploited is crucial to defending against it mentally and emotionally.\nThe Strategic Plan\nAs far back as July of last year, the question was being asked openly as to the existence of sock-puppets and bots operating in the social networks. Scholarly reviews were even written in response to bounties on the topic. Though difficult to nail down with certainty, a number of indicators did point to instances of shared syntax and similarities through pattern analysis. The use of sock-puppet accounts and bots controlled to respond via algorithm is a logical choice for an attacker needing maximum flexibility using minimal resources. There are a good number of individuals around the world capable of efficiently performing these activities on a broad scale across numerous languages and cultures.\u00a0\nIf I were one of those individuals, I would be executing the following strategy:\nPriorities of Work\n\nTeam First: Build a small team of experts in programming, writing and social engineering. Being surrounded by a solid team of capable, independent thinkers makes most jobs a breeze (or at least entertaining when things go sideways). It should be easy to find a good team in an anonymous and technical environment. If flying solo is necessary, it can be done but is far less effective without mental and emotional backup from trusted peers.\nDraw the Map: Identify central communication hubs (IRC, Reddit, Twitter, etc.). These will become your stomping grounds. Get to know the atmosphere of each and incorporate into your goals and planning. For example, r/bitcoin has more than 100,000 subscribers, and a lot of journalists rely on it for coverage. Use the visual representation of key players to begin whatever campaign has been established. If the moderators are on to your shilling, claim CENSORSHIP!! loudly and often, try to migrate users to a new hub or sub, and continue fighting to get back on.\nClone Wars:  Develop a pool of pseudo-identities via sock-puppet account creation tools and begin building available pools of personas with varying degrees of reputation on all of the central communication hubs. Create and eliminate as needed. Anonymity in numbers is your friend here.\nTargeting: Identify centers of influence (vocal developers and thought leaders) as well as soft spots that could potentially evoke emotion (centralization/monopoly! Satoshi\u2019s vision! Nonbelievers!). Take note for future exploitation. The more controversial the individual, the more extreme and subversive the characterizations can become. For instance, was one of the key Classic developers on psychedelics recently? It doesn\u2019t matter if he actually was or not, because now people are asking that question. Mission accomplished.\nConnect the Dots: Create a spider-web diagram along with a significant action database to identify and analyze relationship patterns. Blockstream, for example, is a binding factor as it funds so many developers. Take down Blockstream and you take down over half the Core development team. \u00a0Palantir is one of the mapping tools you can use. This will provide an internal visual reference for those long nights of plotting your next move, and help communicate long-term vision and strategy with your team.\nTurn on the Engine: Utilize a network of pseudo-identities to engage in subversive behavior in communication hubs. (See #4.) This is one big \u201cmovement to contact\u201d drill, meaning to search for the fights. Find topics that draw out people\u2019s emotions and play to them consistently enough to create controversy. Sometimes passion is required, other times mockery and a cruel dismissive attitude works best. Dynamic environments require dynamic responses.\nObserve, React and Respond: Analyze impact and adjust tactics or targets. If the response to certain tactics appears to be disrupting momentum toward your strategic objective, adjust your fire onto things that will. Like a judo expert, sometimes using your opponent's momentum for your own benefit is the wisest path. Other times, a direct jab to the throat solves the problem.\n\nTactics to Be Employed by the Pseudo-Identities\n\nIntensify Discussion: Any news that could be perceived as negative must be amplified to extremes and made into hyperbolic worst-case scenarios. The public departure of Mike Hearn from the Bitcoin space created an environment ripe for exploitation. The media got ahold of that and ran on it for days. This would have been a huge victory for subversives because it further eroded the perceived global integrity of Bitcoin both as a software and a solution. But the Hearn story is only one small example; the list of potential topics is endless: Blocks might fill up...the network will clog...nodes will crash... users will leave...Bitcoin will die!!!! Fear is not difficult to manufacture.\nDepress Positive Momentum: Any story with positive attention should be downplayed while messengers of positive news should be accused of \u201cbeing shills,\u201d \u201cscam artists,\u201d or worse. Blockstream\u2019s acquisition of capital and talent would, in many circles, be viewed as a net positive. Employing the simple tool of implied guilt, however, the perceived value of the asset book becomes a joke, or is used as evidence of foul play. For example: Bitcoin Core\u2019s implementation of mempool limits to prevent the doomsday scenarios of #1 above gets spun as \u201canother fee market!!!\u201d Reality matters less than perception. Another victory.\nCharacter Assassination: Identify flaws and foibles in thought leaders especially; question the integrity and good intentions of anyone who appears to possess either. Any number of names can be pointed to here. With the right amount of assets, you can accomplish quite a bit. Even if you don\u2019t have the facts, choose potentially divisive targets and deploy your sock-puppets to make up rumors. Perception is what matters.\nInstigate Fights: Mock and ridicule both sides of any disagreement that forms to accelerate existing antagonism and grow the division between disparate sides. This past month, a spam attack targeting members of the Reddit Bitcoin communities added more fuel to the fire. The message was sent from a variety of accounts, most with no posts or comments. The message was tailored to look like a personal message, championing the Ethereum platform. Naturally, this created a conflict due to the perceived competitive nature of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nMaintain Access to Pseudo-neutrality: Maintain a number of pseudo-identities with mild, thoughtful reputations to build support or ridicule when advantageous; ridicule and write off any who openly challenge your intentions; when pressed, claim objectivity. Or if reputation is not needed, go into full-blown troll mode and resort to ad hominems. This creates a scene and adds to the sense of collective group insanity, which demoralizes further.\nDeny and Shift Blame: Any attempts by others to accuse of exploitation must be met by either silence or derision (situationally dependent). This is a simple tactic because it never gives any satisfaction of gains made in honest, impassioned debate. If the only result of the majority of your online debates is that you dread the replies to your posts, valuable discussion slows to a crawl.\n\nI would guess with a fair amount of certainty that there are well-developed teams in the world operating similarly to what I outline above. The goal is to slow, stall and/or destroy the viability of specific digital currencies or all of them in general. The possible motives and players who hold them are an entirely different topic.\nNote: I did not write this as a manual for engaging in this behavior, but rather to demonstrate that such behavior is definitely possible with limited resources. Based on my analysis and intuition, there are most certainly actors engaging in these sorts of games.\nAwareness is truly the only effective defense of these techniques. The Bitcoin ecosystem has a tremendously resilient network with a great deal of infrastructure invested behind it. But even elephants are not immune from being eaten by ants from time to time.\nThis is a guest post by Blake Miles\u00a0and the views expressed are those of the author.\u00a0This article was written with the assistance and advice of Aaron van Wirdum.", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 22}

Many of those are set up to immediately convert Bitcoin into fiat currency. OPSkins, an online marketplace of digital gaming skins, demonstrates the value of pairing a digital currency with a digital economy and is setting a new standard for how businesses should integrate with Bitcoin.\u00a0\nOPSkins has grown quickly into the most active marketplace for buying and selling virtual items, specifically for Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO), Dota 2 and Team Fortress 2.\u00a0\n\"The gaming community around OPSkins is the perfect group to demonstrate the power of Bitcoin as the most secure payment method for digital purchases,\" said BitPay Senior Sales Engineer and masspay product lead Corey Glaze in a statement to Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0\nThe company was founded in the beginning of 2015 and now boasts more than 1 million total users and more than 3,000 daily signups, with over 6 million items sold--more than 300,000 per week. \u00a0The rarest of these items can sell for up to $10,000.\nA growing community of people around the world was trading digital skins for Bitcoin when OPSkins introduced it into its platform in August 2015. Bitcoin helps expand their international reach and reduces the risk of fraudulent chargebacks that happens with other online payment options. Bitcoin is also popular among gamers because many are under the age of 18 and so are unable to get a credit card.\u00a0\nAccording to a BitPay blog post, \u201cJust a few months into accepting Bitcoin, [OPSkins] is already processing 400-500 Bitcoin transactions per week. This traction has also shown up in the volume OPSkins has processed, with one notable transaction involving a Bitcoin purchase of $25,000.\u201d\nSoon after accepting Bitcoin transactions, OPSkins went live with Bitcoin as an option for payouts, in addition to PayPal. According to BitPay, OPSkins has daily payouts to sellers of $40,000 in Bitcoin.\u00a0\n\"OPSkins is showing how businesses can use Bitcoin coming and going to streamline transactions processing and reduce costs,\u201d Glaze told Bitcoin Magazine. OPSkins told Bitpay it expects these numbers to increase in tandem with its rapid increase in Bitcoin transactions.\u00a0\nOther Bitcoin payment processors, such as AcceptBT, are also seeing an increased interest from merchants in keeping the Bitcoin they receive. Jamie Robinson, the company's founder, told Bitcoin Magazine \u201cMore and more merchants in Canada are asking about the possibility of keeping all their Bitcoin as Bitcoin, or keeping a percentage of each transaction in Bitcoin and converting the remainder to dollars.\u201d\u00a0\nRetaining Bitcoin is becoming especially popular for merchants who have businesses online. Last week, Market Collectif, an online store that caters to the student market, launched its Bitcoin payment option, and Jeremy Smith, one of the partners of the company, told Bitcoin Magazine it would keep 100 percent of its Bitcoin rather than converting it to dollars automatically.\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 22}

New Research Paper Warns of Future Bitcoin Network Scaling Concerns", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/technical-roadblock-ahead-new-research-paper-warns-of-future-bitcoin-network-scaling-concerns-1455994211/", "birthday": "Feb 20, 2016  1:50 PM EST", "date": "2016-02-20 18:50:00", "content": "MIT Technology Review is weighing in again on the issue of Bitcoin scalability with an article titled \u201cTechnical Roadblock Might Shatter Bitcoin Dreams.\u201d The question is whether the Bitcoin network could be scaled up to support thousands of transactions per second, like the world\u2019s major payment networks. The answer is no, unless the Bitcoin code is radically re-engineered.\nThe debate has been going on for months. In May 2015, Bitcoin Magazine reported that Bitcoin Core developers were disagreeing on the optimal block size, a parameter that is directly related to the throughput of the Bitcoin network. As things stand, the Bitcoin network can process only a few transactions per second, which could strongly limit the ability of the network to handle high transaction volumes if the adoption of bitcoin payments grows.\nOn February 26 a team of researchers from Cornell University, The University of California, Berkeley, ETH Zurich, the National University of Singapore, and the University of Maryland, will present a paper titled \"On Scaling Decentralized Blockchains\" at the Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2016 conference, organized by the International Financial Cryptography Association and IACR.\nAuthor Ari Juels, a cryptographer and professor at the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute at Cornell Tech and a director of the Initiative for Crypto-Currencies and Contracts (IC3), is persuaded that the scaling proposals currently on the table for discussion, centered on increasing the block size, would have little effect.\u00a0\nIn fact, according to Juels, no tweak to Bitcoin could allow transactions at a scale close to the thousands of transactions per second processed by global payment networks such as Visa, without compromising Bitcoin's decentralized design. \u201cWe have to think in terms of a fundamental redesign if we\u2019re going to see robust scaling in Bitcoin,\u201d said Juels.\n\u201cToday\u2019s representative blockchain such as Bitcoin takes 10 min or longer to confirm transactions, achieves 7 transactions/sec maximum throughput,\u201d note the researchers. \u201cIn comparison, a mainstream payment processor such as Visa credit card confirms a transaction within seconds, and processes 2000 transactions/sec on average, with a peak rate of 56,000 transactions/sec.\u201d\u00a0\nBitcoin works by discovering blocks of confirmed transactions at approximate intervals, and its transaction throughput is limited by factors like the maximum block size, the average transaction size, and the block interval.\nAfter an extensive analysis of the factors that limit the throughput of the Bitcoin network, the researchers conclude that reparametrization of the block size and interval in Bitcoin is only a first step toward substantial throughput and latency improvements while retaining significant system decentralization.\u00a0\n\u201cMore aggressive scaling will in the longer term require fundamental protocol redesign,\u201d note the researchers.\nA conclusion of the study is that, in the current design of Bitcoin Core, there is a fundamental conflict between throughput and decentralization. An optimal block size of four megabytes could permit a throughput of about 27 transactions per second in the Bitcoin network, but the price to pay for further increases would be making the Bitcoin system more centralized.\u00a0\nFor example, using a standard Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) replication protocol with a small number of pre-designated trusted entities would permit improved scaling, but decentralization carries a performance cost.\nThe discussion of the possible ways ahead is rather theoretical and generic, and the researchers don\u2019t propose a solution. The goal, they say, \u201cis not to propose an end-to-end system, but rather to paint the design space, suggest promising approaches, and pose open challenges to the community.\u201d\u00a0\nThe promising approaches outlined by the researchers include lightning networks and sidechains able to exploit faster and more efficient protocols while still using Bitcoin as a currency.\nMIT Technology Review notes that many companies are developing private non-Bitcoin blockchains and \u201cpermissioned\u201d blockchains where transactions can be validated only by vetted participants. Private blockchains that don\u2019t require high throughput, for example those envisaged for inter-bank settlements, are less vulnerable to congestion than the public Bitcoin blockchain.\nLegendary cryptographer Adam Back, a co-founder of Blockstream, a well-funded company active in the lightning networks and sidechains space, agrees that new technology is needed to scale up Bitcoin, but is persuaded that the community will be up to the challenge. \u201cThere\u2019s strong interest from academia, lots of new technology coming in the next 18 months, and a lot of funding coming to the industry,\u201d he says, as reported by MIT Technology Review.\nA full version of the research paper will be available on the IC3 website.

Digital Asset Holdings, the fintech startup headed by the financial superstar Blythe Masters, contributed its Hyperledger mark.\nLast week, IBM started to reveal some details of its blockchain projects and strategy. John Wolpert, IBM\u2019s blockchain offering director, said that Hyperledger code will become an open source industry standard, and developers will be able to build applications on top of Hyperledger. \u00a0At the forthcoming Block Chain Conference on February 10 in San Francisco, Wolpert will give a keynote presentation titled \u201cHow to Make Block Chain Real for Business.\u201d The address will focus on IBM\u2019s point of view in this space and its contribution to the open source community led by the Linux Foundation.\nThings are moving fast in the Hyperledger space. The Linux Foundation is announcing new members from across the industry, technical updates to the new Hyperledger Project and a formal open governance structure. \u201cThink of it as an operating system for interactions,\u201d says the new Hyperledger Project website. \u201cIt has the potential to vastly reduce the cost and complexity of getting things done.\n\u201cThe Hyperledger Project has ramped up incredibly fast, a testament to how much pent-up interest, potential and enterprise demand there is for a cross-industry open standard for distributed ledgers,\u201d said Jim Zemlin, executive director at The Linux Foundation. \u201cWorking on its own, even the largest global corporation could not match the speed at which our new members are moving blockchain technology forward. Such a broad effort and investment is sure to have a great impact on our personal and professional lives.\u201d\nA board of directors will guide business/marketing decisions and ensure alignment between the technical communities and members of the Hyperledger Project. Technical contributions to the project are welcome at any time, from anyone, and will be reviewed by the newly formed Technical Steering Committee (TSC), which is composed of industry-leading technical experts. Nominations are currently open for TSC members.\nThe announcement notes that the Hyperledger Project is a collaborative effort to focus on an open platform that will satisfy a variety of use cases across multiple industries to streamline business processes. Peer-to-peer in nature, distributed ledger technology is shared, transparent and decentralized, making it ideal for application in finance and countless other areas such as manufacturing, banking, insurance and the Internet of Things (IoT). \u201cBy creating a cross-industry open standard for distributed ledgers, virtually any digital exchange with value, such as real estate contracts, energy trades or marriage licenses, can securely and cost-effectively be tracked and traded,\u201d says the Linux Foundation.\nThe Hyperledger Project has received proposed contributions from several companies, including Blockstream, Digital Asset, IBM and Ripple. Other community members are contemplating contributions of their own.\n\u201cThe formation of Hyperledger marks a milestone in the advancement of distributed ledger technology,\u201d said Digital Asset CEO Blythe Masters. \u201cDigital Asset believes that it is vital for shared infrastructure to be open to critical inspection and collaboration, and this initiative will be pivotal in driving the global adoption of solutions to real-world problems.\u201d\nThe updated list of Hyperledger founding members consists of 28 top companies in the technology and financial services space: ABN AMRO, Accenture, ANZ Bank, Blockchain, Calastone, Cisco, CLS, CME Group, ConsenSys, Credits, The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group, Digital Asset Holdings, Fujitsu Limited, Guardtime, Hitachi, IBM, Intel, J.P. Morgan, NEC, NTT DATA, R3, Red Hat, State Street, SWIFT, Symbiont, VMware and Wells Fargo.\n\u201cThe development of blockchain technology has the potential to redefine the operations and economics of the financial services industry,\u201d said Richard Lumb, chief executive of Accenture\u2019s Financial Services. \u201cIt emerges at an important time, as the industry strives to be leaner, more efficient and more digital. Open source development will accelerate the innovation and help drive the scalability of this technology, and we are proud to support the Hyperledger Project.\u201d\nOther statements by Hyperledger founding members focus on the non-banking applications of blockchain technology.\n\u201cWe at Fujitsu are confident that blockchain technology will accelerate disruptive change, not only in the financial industry, but also in many other industries where it will be put to active use,\u201d said Fujitsu Senior Vice President Takahito Tokita.\n\u201cWe believe blockchain will quickly mature and spread to more industries,\u201d said Masayoshi Ogawa, President of Hitach\u2019s Financial Information Systems Division.\nOther statements are available in the Linux Foundation press release. It appears that the Linux Foundation\u2019s Hyperledger Project is moving very fast and is on its way to become a leading force in the blockchain technology development space.\nFounded in 2000, the Linux Foundation wants to be the organization of choice for the world's top developers and companies to build ecosystems that accelerate open technology development and commercial adoption.\n\u00a0\nPhoto Drupal Association / Flickr(CC)", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 9}

The company also announced that it was still progressing though the listing process with ASX.\u00a0\nEven though the amount raised was less than a third of the amount it tried for, CEO of Bitcoin Group Sam Lee called it a \u201csolid result.\u201d\nDuring an interview on CNBC on Tuesday, Lee said the amount raised is sufficient for the company to execute its current strategy of acquiring new mining equipment to expand its footprint. \u00a0\nAlthough it was scheduled to take place on Tuesday, Bitcoin Group has not yet announced its quote on the ASX. It is expected that the company will trade under the ticker BCG.\u00a0\nThe price of shares was at AUD $0.20, with AUD $2,000 as the minimum subscription. There is no maximum subscription. According to the Australian Taxation Office, Bitcoin is an asset for capital gains tax purposes.\u00a0\nThis is the first time a publicly listed entity has been led by the Bitcoin Group Management since its incorporation in September 2014. Lee, the CEO, has a background in financial services and digital media.\nOn CNBC, Nicolas Debock, a venture capitalist at Balderton Capital in London, said he would need to think twice before investing in a Bitcoin mining firm, as it has a number of risks. He added that many venture capitalists have invested in Bitcoin in the last three years, but there still has been no money coming out.\u00a0\nBitcoin Group produces approximately 1.2 percent of the world\u2019s Bitcoin mining output, with six mining sites in Iceland and China. Due to the affordability of electric supply in China, a large percentage of its operations are conducted in China. However, since it is significantly lacking in diversification, the company could be left vulnerable to changes in regulations resulting from the Chinese stance on Bitcoin. \u00a0\nIf the company had raised the AUD $20 million it had hoped for, the plan was to use AUD $18 million as an investment in equipment and facilities for Bitcoin mining. The remaining AUD $2 million was to be used for general corporate purposes, including costs for listing.\u00a0\nOn CNBC, Debock said that a large number of people still believe in Bitcoin in the long term, whether it is the technology or the asset.\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 8}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe long-lasting block size dispute has catapulted into the center of attention again. One of the most talked-about developments is Segregated Witness, of which a public testnet iteration \u2013 SegNet \u2013 waslaunched in January. The innovation as recently proposed by Blockstream co-founder and Bitcoin Core developer Dr. Pieter Wuille is a centerpiece of a scalability \u201croadmap\u201d set out by Bitcoin Core.\nTo find out where the broader development community stands on Segregated Witness, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to library and wallet developers, those who will need to do the heavy lifting in order to utilize the innovation once rolled out.\nIn part 7 of this series: Bitcoin Wallet developer and bitcoinj maintainer Andreas Schildbach.\nSegregated Witness Makes Future Extensions Easier\n\nSchildbach is the developer behind Bitcoin Wallet, the first and very popular Bitcoin wallet app for Android. He also maintains the bitcoinj Java library, which was initially created by recent R3CEV-hire Mike Hearn, and provides the basis for Bitcoin Wallet and many other wallet apps.\nWhile Segregated Witness received a lot of attention in light of the block size dispute, many developers are particularly excited about the improvements to the Bitcoin protocol that don\u2019t concern the block size limit directly. Schildbach, too, believes Segregated Witness offers many benefits beyond just the added transaction capacity.\n\u201cSegregated Witness complicates wallet development a bit, but I think it is worth the effort, as it will make future extensions to the Bitcoin protocol much easier,\u201d Schildbach said. \u201cThink of stuff like fraud proofs, a new signature algorithm, increased extensibility, not to mention a fix to the malleability problem \u2013 things we thought we\u2019d need a hard fork for at some point.\u201d\nSegregated Witness also offers an effective block size increase to a range between 1.75 megabytes and 2 megabytes, depending on the types of transactions. Schildbach is skeptical, however, that this will be enough:\n\u201cWhen it comes to the block size topic, I think Segregated Witness is not a solution at all. In the most optimistic estimations, Segregated Witness offers an added 1 megabyte per block. I think that in practice, actual usage will grow slower with Segregated Witness compared to a 2-megabyte hard fork increase, as it requires all wallets and services to upgrade. The space optimization is nice, but just a bit of sugar on top of the other advantages. We will need to see more to achieve real scalability.\u201d\nSoft Fork \u201cLiveable\u201d\n\nRoll-out of Segregated Witness on the Bitcoin network is currently scheduled for April. Once a super-majority of miners agrees to the solution, Segregated Witness will be activated, and can be utilized by wallet and app software.\nSegregated Witness is currently being integrated in bitcoinj, and Schildbach hopes that both bitcoinj and Bitcoin Wallet will be ready to utilize the benefits once the protocol change is rolled out.\n\u201cI drafted a rough schedule for development,\u201d Schildbach said. \u201cOther developers are doing most of the work, so I can focus on code review. I\u2019d say it can be done in a matter of weeks. Once it is done, all wallets built on bitcoinj can simply use the code with minimal effort.\u201d\nThe intended roll-out method of Segregated Witness through a soft fork is being contested by recent Bitcoin implementation Bitcoin Classic. While a soft fork would require only miners to upgrade, Bitcoin Classic plans to deploy a block size increase to 2-megabyte blocks through a hard fork instead, requiring all full nodes on the network to switch in unison.\nSchildbach shared the concerns as presented by Bitcoin Classic, and believes a hard fork to be the preferred solution.\n\u201cBlocks are full, and I don\u2019t agree that a hard fork solution would be short notice. We\u2019ve been discussing this issue for years now! I would prefer we roll out a hard fork,\u201d he said.\nHe added, however, \u201cThat said, I can live with a soft fork, too. And I hope one day a hard fork will be used to clean up the soft-forking mess we leave behind.\u201d\nFor more information on Segregated Witness, see Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s three-part series on the subject, or part 1, part 2, part 3, part 4, part 5 and part 6 of this development series.\n", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 4}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nAlthough scalability (the block size limit) has been the main topic of conversation in the Bitcoin community over the past year, this controversy has also brought up another important subject for the peer-to-peer digital cash system: governance. Bitcoin Core Contributor Peter Todd is no fan of Bitcoin XT, but he does like the fact that Mike Hearn\u2019s alternative implementation of the Bitcoin protocol brought the topic of governance to a wider audience.\nSo how does Bitcoin governance work? Blockchain Capital Managing Partner Brock Pierce was recently asked this question by Jason Calacanis on This Week in Startups, and he described the checks and balances that exist between different participants in the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nA Developer Has to Write the Code\n\nPierce described Bitcoin governance in layers, noting that a developer must first write code that becomes an option for users of the system:\n\u201cThe system actually has multiple layers. One, a developer has to write the code and put it forward. It really goes through a peer-review type of process where it gets vetted because it\u2019s a very public process. It\u2019s an open-source project; that\u2019s what it is.\u201d\nSome are worried about the perceived centralization currently found in the Bitcoin development process, but in reality, developers have no power over what code Bitcoin users decide to run on their computers. Although Bitcoin Core is currently the reference implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, the five developers with commit access to that particular software client do not have any sort of tyrannical power over the system.\nThe Consensus of Miners\n\nOnce a developer has written some code, it is then up to miners to decide whether they should switch to that new software or stick with the code they\u2019re currently running. Miners even have the ability to not upgrade their software if they do not agree with a change made by the development team behind the current reference implementation of the protocol.\nDuring his interview, Pierce noted much more than 51 percent of miners need to agree on any proposed changes to Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules:\n\n\u201cThe people that are running the infrastructure have to come to an agreement. The miners have to say yes, and then they need to run it, process a certain number of blocks, and you actually need more than 51 percent. You really need \u2013 call it 90 percent. You need [social] consensus of those miners.\u201d\nThe level of social consensus among miners needed to implement a change that would cause a hard fork differs depending on whom you talk to. Bitcoin Foundation Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen would say 75 percent of miners is enough for a hard fork, while the developers behind Bitcoin Core would like to see \u201cnear-universal agreement\u201d before implementing such a change. The Chinese Bitcoin community has also decided it will only accept a hard fork to a 2-megabyte block size limit if 90 percent of the network hashrate agrees to it. Having said that, it\u2019s unclear whether they would be willing to switch to Bitcoin Classic in order to make that change.\nUsers Choose Which Coin Has Value\n\nThe last level of Bitcoin governance is the user base. After all, bitcoin miners are only going to mine on a blockchain that actually has value. Pierce explained the role of Bitcoin holders and Bitcoin companies in Bitcoin governance:\n\u201cThe miners are also influenced by the other parties, which would be the companies: the Bitcoin exchanges, the wallets, [and] the payment process. What happens is you go through this process of a hard fork where you get two versions of the software running, which means now everyone\u2019s coins have been replicated into two wallets. Now, whichever one the payment processors accept as real \u2013 they start to have an influence.\u201d\nThis Week in Startups host Calacanis noted the similarities between the participants in the Bitcoin network and the three branches of government in the United States:\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like the government where you have the executive branch, the legislative branch [and the judicial branch].\u201d\nThe recent launches of Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic have been the first serious tests of this governance model. Bitcoin Core has been able to avoid a hard fork for the time being by implementing Segregated Witness via a soft fork , but there is near-universal consensus on the need for an eventual hard fork to a larger block size limit in Bitcoin.\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

The group will work with the Linux Foundation to create a public network that lets blockchain applications built on top of it communicate with each other.\nDigital Asset Holdings, the fintech startup headed by the financial superstar Blythe Masters, is contributing its Hyperledger mark, which will be used as the project name, as well as enterprise grade code and developer resources. Digital Asset Holdings bought San Francisco-based Hyperledger in June.\nNow IBM is starting to reveal some details of its blockchain projects and strategy. \nIn an interview with IT analyst David Strom published in IBM\u2019s online magazine Security Intelligence, John Wolpert, IBM\u2019s blockchain offering director, said that IBM will eventually have hundreds of developers working on various blockchain projects. IBM didn\u2019t invent blockchain technology but plans to take a leading role in its development, with an approach similar to IBM\u2019s Java developments. \n\u201c[Java] wasn\u2019t our technology, but we got behind it and put an army against it,\u201d Wolpert said. \u201cAt its height, thousands were working on Java-related projects.\u201d\nWolpert is responsible for engineering, products and open source initiatives at IBM. Previously, he was head of products for IBM\u2019s Watson Ecosystem \u2013 IBM\u2019s ambitious Artificial Intelligence (AI) project \u2013 and a successful entrepreneur before joining IBM. \nAt the forthcoming Block Chain Conference on February 10 in San Francisco, Wolpert will give a keynote presentation titled \u201cHow to Make Block Chain Real for Business.\u201d The address will focus on IBM\u2019s point of view in this space and its contribution to the open source community led by the Linux Foundation. The open source community is aimed at accelerating the maturity of this shared ledger technology, through a collective, open and coordinated approach.\nWolpert said that Hyperledger code will become an open source industry standard, eventually available on Github just like other open-source software, and developers will be able to build applications on top of Hyperledger. \n\u201cThere are going to be lots of people who will compete on providing solutions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will try to get the best minds across the industry to work together on this code.\u201d\nDevelopers will be able to deploy Hyperledger applications on the IBM Cloud, a collection of fully integrated services to help IBM clients use data across all digital channels to understand their customers and anticipate their needs. According to the company, IBM Cloud is the first full spectrum cloud built on open technologies, with the world\u2019s most advanced analytics and cognitive computing toolbox. \n\u201cWe intend to be the best place and fastest place to get blockchain technologies running,\u201d said Wolpert. \u201cWe are moving assets on a massive scale in ways that we never thought of before and doing so automatically and without any human intervention. It isn\u2019t just the data, but using the transaction log of the data in new and interesting ways.\u201d\nThe recent U.K. Government Office for Science report \u201c\u201cDistributed Ledger Technology: Beyond Block Chain\u201d noted that the strong association of blockchain technology with Bitcoin represents an important problem when it comes to communicating the potential benefits of distributed ledgers. \nWolpert agrees, and adds that many banks and other traditional financial institutions were hesitant to be associated with blockchains because of Bitcoin. But IBM\u2019s strategy is more focused on non-banking applications of blockchain technology. \n\u201cNow people are talking about how they can use blockchains without endorsing any shadow currencies, and everyone is excited,\u201d said Wolpert. \u201cIt has gone beyond being a fad.\u201d\nWolpert is persuaded that blockchain technology could have many important non-currency applications, and, in particular, that it could be a solid foundation for more efficient supply chain networks.\nPhoto Patrick / \nFlickr(CC)\n\n", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 4}

Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs, took the stage at the Moscone Center in San Francisco and introduced the world to the iPhone.\nNine years later, many have trouble remembering what life was like before the rise of mobile. The average smartphone today is more than one million times smaller, one million times more affordable and one thousand times more powerful than a $60 million supercomputer was 40 years ago. As a result of successive radical innovation, we have truly changed the world, but more importantly the world has forever changed us.\nIn 1998, when asked what keeps him up at night, Bill Gates had a surprising answer. As the CEO of Microsoft, one might have expected him to say Apple, Oracle, or even Netscape. Instead he stated: \u201cI worry about someone in a garage inventing something that I haven\u2019t thought of.\u201d Unbeknownst to Gates, at that very moment Larry Page and Sergey Brin were hard at work in a garage in Menlo Park. The fruit of their labor would go on to become Google.\nGates, like many of us, has accepted that change, particularly technological change, is one of the few constants in life and even the smartest among us can be caught be caught by surprise.\nOn January 3rd, 2009, less than two years after Jobs unveiled the iPhone, Satoshi Nakamoto sent an email to the renowned \u201cCryptography Mailing List\u201d titled \u201cBitcoin v0.1 released.\u201d The email contained a SourceForge link to the first bitcoin reference client and the following statement:\n\u201cAnnouncing the first release of Bitcoin, a new electronic cash system that uses a peer-to-peer network to prevent double spending. It\u2019s completely decentralized with no server of central authority\u201d\nNakamoto then went on to give a brief summary of Bitcoin\u2019s implementation and explicitly add a disclaimer stating that the included software was still alpha and experimental.\nWhen Jobs introduced the iPhone he had the attention of the entire tech world. Everyone knew the device would be a game changer, but no one could have predicted that five years later the iPhone would catalyze the creation of a ride hailing application called Uber. Today Uber has an estimated worth of $62.5 billion, higher than that of car markets GM, Ford and Honda, and could very well go on to become the world\u2019s first trillion-dollar company.\nNakamoto\u2019s announcement on the other hand went relatively unnoticed by the public, but a handful of dreamers immediately realized the ramifications of Satoshi\u2019s vision. The first to respond to Nakamoto\u2019s email was cypherpunk legend Hal Finney. Three days later on January 12, Nakamoto executed the first Bitcoin transaction, in block 170, sending 50 bitcoins to Finney.\nIn May of 2010 roughly a year and a half after Bitcoin\u2019s genesis block was mined by Nakamoto, two members of the BitcoinTalk community forum executed the first real-world purchase. 10,000 BTC for a $25 pizza. Five and a half years have since passed and with a near six-billion dollar market capitalization it is safe to say that Bitcoin come a long way, but there is still a ways to go.\nBitcoin Today\n\nSince 2013 the Bitcoin industry has somewhat operated in stealth mode. Companies like 21 Inc, BitGo and Blockstream have been hard at work in collaboration with the Bitcoin Core developers to ready Bitcoin for the next and brightest stage of its life thus far. In the words of software legend Joel Spolsky, \u201cGood software takes 10 years. Get used to it.\u201d\n\n21 Inc\u2019s CEO, Dr. Balaji S. Srinivasan stated the following in a lecture at Stanford University prior to founding 21:\n\u201cA good founder is capable of anticipating which turns lead to treasure and which lead to certain death. A bad founder is just running to the entrance of (say) the \u2018movies/music/filesharing/P2P\u2019 maze or the \u2018photo sharing\u2019 maze without any sense for the history of the industry, the players in the maze, the casualties of the past, and the technologies that are likely to move walls and changes assumptions.\u201d\nSo what about Bitcoin is likely to \u201cmove walls\u201d and \u201cchange assumption?\u201d While user-monetizable data is of significant importance to Bitcoin\u2019s future, the concept of \u201cuser-monetizable actions\u201d is of far greater importance.\nThe DARPA Network Challenge\n\nAt 10 a.m. EST on December 5th, 2009 (this date was picked to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Internet) the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), known for creating the ARPANET, a precursor to the Internet and contributing to the onion protocol used by the Tor network, launched 10 red balloons in undisclosed locations across the continental United States. A month earlier DARPA proposed an open challenge to teams across the nation. The first team to locate all 10 balloons and report their findings to DARPA would receive a $40,000 reward. What happened next exceeded the researchers wildest expectations.\nLess than nine hours after DARPA launched the balloons a team from MIT won the competition. How did they do it? By embracing the concept of user-monetizable actions.\nIn 2005, Jon Kleinberg of the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University and Prabhakar Raghaven of Yahoo! Research published a paper titled \u201cQuery Incentive Networks.\u201d In it they write:\n\u201cThe concurrent growth of online communities exhibiting large-scale social structure, and of large decentralized peer-to-peer file-sharing systems, has stimulated new interest in understanding networks of interacting agents as economic systems. Here we formulate a model for query incentive networks, motivated by such systems: users seeking information or services can pose queries, together with incentives for answering them, that are propagated along paths in a network. This type of information-seeking process can be formulated as a game among the nodes in the network, and this game has a natural Nash equilibrium. In such systems, it is a fundamental question to understand how much incentive is needed in order for a node to achieve a reasonable probability of obtaining an answer to a query from the network.\u201d\nBuilding off the ideas presented in Kleinburg and Raghavan\u2019s research, the team from MIT came up with the following strategy:\n\u201cWe\u2019re giving $2000 per balloon to the first person to send us the correct coordinates, but that's not all -- we're also giving $1000 to the person who invited them. Then we\u2019re giving $500 whoever invited the inviter, and $250 to whoever invited them, and so on.\n\"It might play out like this. Alice joins the team, and we give her an invite link like http://balloon.media.mit.edu/alice. Alice then e-mails her link to Bob, who uses it to join the team as well. We make a http://balloon.media.mit.edu/bob link for Bob, who posts it to Facebook. His friend Carol sees it, signs up, then twitters about http://balloon.media.mit.edu/carol. Dave uses Carol\u2019s link to join \u2026 then spots one of the DARPA balloons! Dave is the first person to report the balloon\u2019s location to us, and the MIT Red Balloon Challenge Team is the first to find all 10. Once that happens, we send Dave $2000 for finding the balloon. Carol gets $1000 for inviting Dave, Bob gets $500 for inviting Carol, and Alice gets $250 for inviting Bob. The remaining $250 is donated to charity.\u201d\nIn essence the MIT team designed a recursive algorithm executed by willing participants by redistributing the prize money to the participants in such a way that a power incentive structure came to life.\nWhile the MIT team\u2019s accomplishment is significant, particularly from the perspective of academia, it wasn\u2019t the only major insight derived from the DARPA Network Challenge. Hacker George Hotz, known as geohot, in 2007 was the first person to carrier-unlock an iPhone. Hotz later went on to jailbreak Sony\u2019s PlayStation 3. Hotz recently made headlines when he and a writer from Bloomberg Businessweek took a drive around the San Francisco Bay area in a self-driving car he built alone in just a month. An hour prior to the start of the DARPA Network Challenge, Hotz tweeted to his then roughly 50,000 followers asking for their assistance in locating the balloons. Through his network Hotz located four ballons, he was then able to trade information with other teams ultimately bringing his balloon count to eight.\nThe approach taken by the MIT team displays the raw power that a properly designed algorithm can have outside as well as inside the confines of Silicon. Hotz\u2019s approach, on the other hand, allows us to contrast the academic perspective with that of a single hacker wielding influence over a network of individuals.\nIf one combines the two approaches, by using Bitcoin to send microtransactions to their own network of followers, what you end up with is a variant of Kleinberg and Raghavan\u2019s Query Incentive Network model that allows one to execute MapReduce-like operations over a large network of willing participants.\nEnd-User Monetization\n\nWe can change our perspective, yet again, and view things through the eyes of an end user performing tasks on behalf of another individual. While this sounds like a new concept it really isn\u2019t. Celebrities have monetized their actions on Twitter and Facebook for years. The musician Jared Leto and socialite Kim Kardashian have reportedly received payments as high as $13,000 per tweet for promoting products that fall in line with their personal brand.\nUntil now, it hasn\u2019t financially made sense for a user with a few thousand followers to receive payments for endorsements. Additionally, most celebrities tend to rely on agents who cut deals with sponsors on their behalf. Even if the average user put in the effort to build a network of sponsors, it is highly unlikely that a sponsor would want to deal with a user who\u2019s follower count is below 100,000. As with most scenarios that rely on the ability to perform microtransactions, the pre-bitcoin banking system isn\u2019t designed to handle small, fast, and international transactions.\nEarlier this week Srinivasan presented his thoughts on the future of user-monetizable actions. After presenting scenarios such as the Twitter covered above and derivatives such as a Bitcoin-based, decentralized version of Fiverr, he left two questions to ponder:\n\nWhat would life be like if even while you were asleep an autonomous agent handled requests that earned Bitcoin on your behalf?\nWhat would you do with your own personal army of willing, waiting, able and ready individuals?\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Bitcoin Engineering class at Stanford University has gone tremendously well. Likely because a majority of the students enrolled in the course have little to no previous knowledge about Bitcoin, they will be able to leverage the abstractions provided by the 21 Bitcoin Computer\u2019s two1 Python3 library and quickly rhapsodize applications into existence without the burden of knowledge (fatigue) many of us have accumulated over the years.\nA computer science student named Axel Ericsson hacked together his own tunneling protocol allowing him to securely communicate with his 21 Bitcoin Computer from a web browser. While a future release of the two1 library will likely support browser-to-machine BitTransfers triggered by 402 requests, today the 21 Bitcoin Computer is being used for machine-to-machine transactions. Most likely, Axel executed one of the world\u2019s first 402 request transactions initiated from a web browser in exchange for user-monetizable data.", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 8}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe long-lasting block size dispute has catapulted into the center of attention again. One of the most talked about developments is Segregated Witness, of which a public testnet iteration \u2013 SegNet \u2013 was launched in January. The innovation as recently proposed by Blockstream co-founder and Bitcoin Core developer Dr. Pieter Wuille is a centerpiece of a scalability \u201croadmap\u201d set out by Bitcoin Core.\nTo find out where the broader development community stands on Segregated Witness, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to library and wallet developers, those who will need to do the heavy lifting in order to utilize the innovation once rolled out.\nIn part 8 of this series: NBitcoin developer Nicolas Dorier.\nSegregated Witness\n\nNicolas Dorier is the CTO of Metaco, an open asset (colored coin) company that helps financial institutions emit fiat currency on the blockchain. Dorier is also lead developer of NBitcoin, the main .NET library for Bitcoin development, and he wrote a free ebook on Blockchain Programming: Blockchain Programming in C#.\nDorier already implemented full Segregated Witness support into NBitcoin, and launched a basic block explorer and transaction parser and checker on Segnet. He also briefly contributed to Segregated Witness development itself.\n\u201cSegregated Witness is a net win, there is not any downside to adopt it at all,\u201d Dorier said. \u201cIt is one of the two pieces of the puzzle \u2013 the other being OP_CSV \u2013 to make Bitcoin scale to millions of users, by making the Lightning Network highly effective. I am also very excited by the new method to sign transactions, which now includes the value of outputs being spent. This is huge from a security perspective for webwallets and hardware wallets, as it prevents [the] user from adding too much fees by mistake. And last but not least, it increases the capacity of Bitcoin. I expect Segregated Witness adoption to follow an \u2018S-curve\u2019; wallets will jump on it very quickly.\u201d\nWhile Segregated Witness has been criticized as being a complicated solution, Dorier\u2019s experience suggests otherwise. According to Dorier:\n\u201cFrom an implementation perspective it was relatively easy. I would say it took a little more than two or three days for NBitcoin support. I had to re-factor internal stuff to make it easier for NBitcoin\u2019s users. Once implemented in NBitcoin, adding Segregated Witness to my block explorer was just a matter of updating the relevant package and redeploying it. Smartbit, another block explorer, has already done this as well, and can attest to the simplicity.\u201d\nSoft Fork\n\nRoll-out of Segregated Witness on the Bitcoin network is currently scheduled for April. Once a super-majority of miners agrees on the solution, Segregated Witness will be activated, and it can be used by wallet and app software. \nAmong other benefits, this means that anyone using the new possibilities will use only about two-thirds to half the space in the available 1 megabyte blocks. These transactions get to pay a lower fee, and more transactions can be processed on the Bitcoin network.\nBut this strategy is being contended by the recently launched Bitcoin Core fork Bitcoin Classic. Bitcoin Classic most likely plans to deploy a block size increase to 2 megabyte blocks through a hard fork once 75 percent of hash power agrees, and a four-week \u201cgrace period\u201d for all full nodes on the network to switch to the new rules.\nBitcoin Classic\u2019s strategy has not gathered much support among library and wallet developers, however.\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear: Segragated Witness is the fatest way to bump the block size,\u201d Dorier explained. \u201cThe migration to Segregated Witness does not need to be synchronized between service and wallet providers. In other words, anyone can receive Segregated Witness transactions even if their wallet did not upgrade \u2013 though in that case you\u2019d have to trust on miners for validation.\u201d\nHard Fork\n\nDorier does believe the block size limit will need to be increased through a hard fork a bit further down the road.\n\u201cEven with 1 megabyte blocks, Segregated Witness, and the Lightning Network deployed, Bitcoin will only be able to cater some 14 million users,\u201d Dorier said. \u201cThanks to Segregated Witness, such an increase is not strictly needed for another year. But if there is consensus about raising the block size limit \u2013 and it\u2019s clear it won\u2019t hurt the network \u2013 it should be done nevertheless.\u201d\nBut Dorier does hope this change will eventually come from the Bitcoin Core development team, rather than Bitcoin Classic, explaining:\n\u201cCore has proven to be reliable over the past years. All of their contributions to Bitcoin reached the highest standard of software development. Their commits speak for themselves. So I don\u2019t support any \u2018change of governance.\u2019 In my opinion, Bitcoin Classic was pushed for political reasons; to try to get the power out of Bitcoin Core\u2019s hands by some unproven team for unknown purposes. I will personally only support a 2 megabyte hard fork with 90 percent hash power vote, and a grace period of a year. This would make it clear the goal is not to raise a war against Bitcoin\u2019s best contributors.\nEven if Bitcoin Core doesn\u2019t commit to a specific date, saying something like, \u2018We will propose to do it sometime next year\u2019 would fix a lot of the drama. It would also prevent a disastrous hard fork which could result into a split. What Bitcoin Classic proposes is the most dangerous thing that can happen to Bitcoin right now.\u201d\nFor more information on Segregated Witness, see Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s three\n-part\nseries\non the subject, or part 1\n, part 2\n, part 3\n, part 4\n, part 5\n, part 6\nand part 7\nof this development series.\n", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 5}
{"title": "On the Detriments of Segregated Witness for Bitcoin ", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/on-the-detriments-of-segregated-witness-for-bitcoin-1454948591/", "birthday": "Feb 8, 2016  11:23 AM EST", "date": "2016-02-08 16:23:00", "content": "Aaron van Wirdum is interested in decentralized consensus, FOSS, privacy in the digital age, censorship resistant payments, and more of that stereotypical Bitcoin stuff. Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nSegregated Witness has been the center of Bitcoin\u2019s long-lasting scaling debate since it was first introduced by Blockstream co-founder and Bitcoin Core developer Dr. Pieter Wuille two months ago.\u00a0\nA nifty method to move signature data from typical transactions into \u201cadd-on blocks,\u201d Segregated Witness is set to improve the Bitcoin protocol in several ways . Moreover, the solution can be rolled out as a soft fork, meaning that only miners need to upgrade their software; all other nodes can do so if and when they please.\u00a0\nThe innovation is positioned as the first step of a scalability \u201croadmap \u201d as set out by Bitcoin Core, and is supported by a large segment of Bitcoin's development community.\nBut Segregated Witness is not free of controversy. Rather than a Segregated Witness soft fork, the recently launched alternative Bitcoin implementation Bitcoin Classic plans to increase Bitcoin's block size limit to 2 megabytes through a hard fork, meaning all full nodes on the network need to upgrade synchronously.\nThese are the arguments against a Segregated Witness soft fork \u2013 and their counterarguments.\nIt Requires 'Ugly' Code\n\nA purist argument against Wuille's proposal is that a Segregated Witness soft fork constitutes an \u201cugly\u201d workaround of code. Most important, it uses parts of the miner-generated coinbase transaction for purposes they were not originally intended for. The added complexity could potentially cause new problems as the protocol keeps evolving.\nThe counterarguments\n\nWhile most developers agree a hard fork would be a cleaner solution, this does not necessarily mean a Segregated Witness soft fork is unsafe. The Bitcoin Core development team has rolled out several similar soft forks in the past, and maintains that this one would not carry any more risk.\nA hard fork, meanwhile, renders all existing full node software incompatible with newer full node software, which is, arguably, not very graceful either.\nIt Burdens Developers Too Much\n\nA Segregated Witness soft fork workaround imposes an added burden on developers -- both now and in the future. This is particularly true for Bitcoin library and wallet developers, as they will need to adapt their software to integrate Segregated Witness. This will require more effort than a hard fork block size increase would.\nThe counterargument\n\nMost current library and wallet developers don't seem to consider the added burden a big problem. Many are even quite excited about the innovation, and they typically consider the added benefits worth the effort. (See Bitcoin Magazine 's development series, as linked below in this article.)\nGrowth of Added Block Space Will Be Slow\n\nLike Bitcoin Classic\u2019s proposed hard fork, Segregated Witness theoretically offers up to 1 megabyte of added block space, for a total of 2 megabytes. But this optimal added capacity is based on multisig transactions, as these get an accounting \u201cdiscount.\u201d Yet most transactions are currently not multisig transactions. A more realistic capacity increase could therefore be closer to .6 megabytes of added space, for a total of 1.6 megabytes.\nAdditionally, this added space might not be fully utilized right away. It can be used only after wallets and other apps have upgraded. In reality, it could take a while before even 1.6 megabytes is reached.\nAnd while the Segregated Witness soft fork is scheduled for April, it remains to be seen if this can be achieved. The solution requires much coding and testing before it can be rolled out, as well as approval by miners.\nThe counterarguments\n\nA public testnet version of Segregated Witness \u2013 SegNet \u2013 is already available for experimention. This suggests that development is on schedule.\nMany library and wallet developers, moreover, estimate that it would take anywhere between a couple of days to several weeks to integrate Segregated Witness. An April release should, therefore, provide enough time for the bulk of wallet and app software to upgrade.\nAs soon as Segregated Witness is activated, all wallet and app software can utilize the benefits \u2013 such as lower fees \u2013 immediately. Whether other users utilize the added space as well does not not really matter for them. (And if the added block space is not used, it might just suggest that the need for extra block space was never that great in the first place.)\nIt should also be noted that multisig transactions might find increasing use as innovation and development of the Bitcoin protocol progresses, because added layers on top of Bitcoin \u2013 such as payment channels and the Lightning Network \u2013 typically use such transactions. The effective capacity could, therefore, come closer to 2 megabytes later on. \u00a0\nAnd while the Bitcoin Classic team maintains that a hard fork can be rolled out before April, this is considered overtly aggressive and outright risky by many within the development community. The need for all full node operators to both review and adopt the upgrade, they think, requires at least six months to a year.\nIt Skews Incentives\n\nRemoval of signatures from the original 1-megabyte blocks can effectively increase Bitcoin\u2019s block size. But Segregated Witness does introduce a new type of maximum block size. Roughly: A block without the witness, plus one quarter of the witness size, must not exceed 1 megabyte. As such, upgraded nodes will see blocks that exceed 1 megabyte, since the actual size of the Segregated Witness is larger than the quarter accounted for.\n\nThis means that multisig transactions, which include more signature data, get a greater discount. And since multisig transactions are used to establish layers on top of Bitcoin, Segregated Witness artificially skews incentives toward these added layers.\nLong-term consequences of such layers \u2013 such as the effect on mining fees \u2013 are controversial.\nThe counterarguments\n\nDiscounting signature data is how Segregated Witness allows for added block space without requiring a hard fork. While this is indeed accomplished through an accounting measure, it is a useful one.\nAdditionally, witness data can be reasonably considered expendable after a certain amount of time, decreasing the need for full nodes to store it in perpetuity. It, therefore, has a lower cost to the network, making it reasonable to charge a lower fee.\nFurthermore, the only way Bitcoin can reach millions of users while also remaining decentralized, secure and censorship-resistant is through the use of added layers. Incentivizing development and use of these added layers is not a bad thing.\nIt Doesn't Hold Well Under Adversarial Conditions\n\nOne argument in favor of a block size limit concerns block propagation and latency. In short: Bigger blocks tend to increase orphan rates, as more miners build on old blocks while newer blocks are still making their way through the network. This, in turn, favors larger miners (or pools): They find more blocks themselves, and start building on these right away, meaning they waste fewer resources.\nThis also means that large miners could have an incentive to actually create artificially large blocks, specifically designed to increase the orphan rate of competitors.\nThe current Segregated Witness proposal allows blocks up to about 2 megabytes \u2013 though a bit less is more likely. But due to the specific accounting measure to be employed, so-called \u201cselfish miners\u201d could create synthetic transactions designed to stuff up to 4 megabytes of data into a single block. As such, big miners could \u201cattack\u201d competitors with valid 4 megabyte blocks.\nSegregated Witness, therefore, requires miners and full nodes to deploy hardware with 4-megabyte safety headroom, while getting significantly less real transaction capacity in return. And if the original block size limit is increased through a hard fork at some point in the future, this risk multiplyer will probably remain.\nThe counterarguments\n\nIf 4 megabytes is indeed large enough to successfully pull off an attack \u2013 which is unclear \u2013 this attack would require the attacking miner to discard all real transactions. The resulting loss of fees serves as a slight disincentive to carrying out such an attack, and it would be obvious to the rest of the network that an attack is going on.\nAnd while the risk multiplier will probably indeed remain even if a hard fork is rolled out later on, it could potentially be decreased through a soft fork as well.\nIt Degrades Security of Non-upgraded Nodes\n\nA fifth concern is that a Segregated Witness soft fork would degrade the security of all non-upgraded full nodes. These nodes could still accept Segregated Witness transactions, or transactions that depend on a previous Segregated Witness transaction, but be unable to verify whether the signature data is valid. As such, they'd have to rely on validation by miners.\nUnconfirmed Segregated Witness transactions would, therefore, be insecure, as these are not yet verified by miners at all.\nBut even confirmed Segregated Witness transactions would be less secure, as miners could purposely mine invalid transactions into blocks with the intention to double-spend non-upgraded nodes. A non-upgraded node would believe these blocks to be valid until the miners switch their hash power back to the valid chain. If a non-upgraded node accepted transactions from the invalid blocks, he might have lost money.\nThe costs of such a double-spend would resemble the cost of any other 51-percent-attack, but with added leverage. Attacking miners could potentially leverage hash power from \u201cSPV-miners,\u201d who wouldn't know what's going on themselves, since they don't validate transactions either. And the attacker could leverage funds to double-spend, as he could use any Segregated Witness-protected bitcoin that never belonged to him in the first place.\nThe counterarguments\n\nA Segregated Witness soft fork will be publicly announced far in advance, and transparently voted on by miners. As such, any user running a full node will have plenty of time to take the necessary precautions.\nUsers running a non-upgraded node should not trust zero-confirmation transactions. But zero-confirmation transactions were always unsafe. Anyone who wants to pull off a double-spend attack with unconfirmed transactions can do so with or without Segregated Witness.\nThe added risk of confirmed transactions, meanwhile, can be offset by waiting for some additional number of confirmations. (For exact figures of the added risks, see these calculations by Bitcoin developer Oleg Andreev.)\nA user who does not want to upgrade to the newest full node status at all, furthermore, could patch his non-upgraded full node with software that flags suspicious transactions \u2013 and potentially even reject such transactions completely.\nLast, it should be noted that hard forks pose a much greater risk of double-spend transactions. Any non-upgraded node could, in the case of a hard fork, receive completely invalid transactions while potentially never realizing it at all.\nIt Will Be Deployed without Explicit User Consent\n\nThough arguably small, the security degradation as described above does exist. And what's perhaps more important: This security degradation would be enforced without explicit consent from users. Even if users strongly oppose Segregated Witness, and prefer not to upgrade, a majority of miners could push the change through regardless.\nThis is at odds with Bitcoin\u2019s promise of personal autonomy; the idea that operators of a full node should always have the possibility to opt-out of any change.\nThe counterarguments\n\nSoft forks cannot be prevented. Miners controlling a majority of hash power can always decide to enforce new rules, as long as they do not break the existing consensus rules. This is inherent to the Bitcoin protocol, and will be possible after a hard fork just as well.\nAs such, users running full nodes must always bear some responsibility. Either the responsibility to upgrade to the latest version of the software, or the responsibility to wait for an added number of confirmations, or perhaps even the responsibility to not accept any transactions after a soft fork is detected.\nAnd while it\u2019s technically true that users don\u2019t need to change their software after a (contentious) hard fork, and can choose to \u201cstay behind\u201d on the original network, this will almost certainly not be the option in practice. Besides the risk of double-spend attacks, decreased hash power could ensure that transactions never confirm \u2013 or confirm very slowly.\nAn alternate scenario is that the minority chain by hash power introduces its own hard fork to change the proof-of-work algorithm. Bitcoin would then split up into two separate networks, and all users would have to upgrade their software to support one of the options \u2013 or both.\n\u00a0\nThanks to Jonathan Toomim and Ciphrex CEO, Bitcoin Core, and Segregated Witness developer Eric Lombrozo for proofreading and added feedback.\n\nFor more information on Segregated Witness, see Bitcoin Magazine's series on the subject, or part 1, part 2, part 3, part 4, part 5, part 6, part 7 and part 8 of  Bitcoin Magazine's development series.\n", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 8}

Stopping them is a significant business cost for manufacturers of the real thing. And for consumers who pride themselves on owning luxury goods, getting the real thing is essential to a way of life.\nThat's where Bitcoin comes in.\n\u00a0\u201cBy linking digital certificates to purchased goods, we are able to provide a much higher degree of confidence to buyers, especially when purchasing from online or second-hand retailers,\u201d says Guy Halford-Thompson, founder of Blockchain Tech Ltd.\nThe company uses blockchain technology to create a secure registry, tracking who owns designer products. In turn, the database has everything a consumer needs to determine whether the product in hand is actually what it\u2019s supposed to be.\nWith blockchain technology, individuals can track the entire journey of the item from assembly to vendor.\n\u201cWhile some consumers may be looking to purchase more affordable 'look-alikes,\u2019 the concern comes from consumers who are looking to purchase genuine items, but because of the advances in manufacturing processes, it can be very difficult to distinguish between real and look-alike,\u201d Halford-Thompson continued. \u201cThis is not a large concern when purchasing from known high-street stores, but it becomes a huge issue when consumers are looking to purchase new or second-hand items off online marketplaces.\u201d\nAlthough obtaining luxury goods is seemingly easier than ever before thanks to the Internet, not every seller is playing by the rules. Halford-Thompson says that watches, handbags and sunglasses are the most counterfeited items he\u2019s seen on the market. However, he has confidence in blockchain and \u201csmart tagging.\u201d\n\u201cSmart tagging will provide consumers with a better brand experience, and a higher degree of confidence in the items they are buying,\u201d Halford-Thompson adds.\nAnd he isn\u2019t the only one who feels this way.\n\u201cIn five years, encrypted chips will be in all of your luxury consumer goods,\u201d says Ryan Orr, CEO of Chronicled. \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018if,\u2019 but \u2018when.\u2019\u201d\nSimilar to Blockchain Tech Ltd., Chronicled is a company that uses smart tags to track authentic sneakers that hit the market. With the Chronicled mobile app, shoe shoppers can scan the smart tag of the product and get all of the information about its authenticity in a matter of seconds.\nAs of right now, Orr claims that Air Jordan 11s and Yeezys are the most commonly counterfeited shoes. He adds, however, that his company is raising the stakes for counterfeiters by providing even more security to consumers.\n\u201cBy combining blockchain technology and smart tags, undetectable forgery becomes impossible, and wearing fakes becomes socially risky,\u201d Orr said.\nBut is doing the \u201cuncool\u201d thing by counterfeiting goods going to be enough to persuade people to stop? In the end, the answer may be \u201cyes\u201d for a majority of consumers.\n\u201cTrusted sneaker sellers earn at least a 20 percent premium, and it\u2019s not just the \u2018buy\u2019 side of the transaction that affects consumers,\u201d Orr points out. \u201cMost of us don\u2019t even consider trying to sell our authentic used luxury goods on the Internet because we know we won\u2019t get fair value.\u201d\nHowever, there\u2019s no doubt that counterfeiters are getting better.\n\u201cWait until they start 3-D printing,\u201d Orr warns.\nCounterfeiters might always have a new trick, but blockchain technology will now be chasing the bad guys.

One of the most talked-about developments is Segregated Witness, of which a public testnet iteration was launched last week. The innovation as recently proposed by Blockstream co-founder and Bitcoin Core developer Dr. Pieter Wuille is a centerpiece of a scalability \u201croadmap\u201d set out by Bitcoin Core.\nTo find out where the broader development community stands on Segregated Witness, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to library and wallet developers; those who will need to do the heavy lifting in order to utilize the innovation once rolled out.\nIn part 4 of this series: Mycelium developer Leo Wandersleb.\n\nSegregated Witness\n\nWuille\u2019s Segregated Witness proposal is set to offer several improvements to the Bitcoin protocol. The benefit that has received the most attention is its potential to effectively increase the block size to a range from 1.75 megabytes to 2 megabytes without requiring a hard fork. Interestingly, however, many Bitcoin developers are more excited about the other Bitcoin protocol improvements that Segregated Witness has to offer.\nWandersleb, whose Mycelium has officially committed to integrating Segregated Witness once rolled out, acknowledged the importance of the innovation.\n\u201cSegregated Witness is not a block size increase, but a technical necessity to fix completely different issues, by also producing less load on the blockchain,\u201d Wandersleb explained. \u201cThere is, however, a realistic chance that it will take a long while before it has an effect on total transaction throughput.\u201d\nThe Mycelium developer believes, however, that Wuille\u2019s Segregated Witness proposal is the best way forward, at this point.\n\u201cThe fact that all of this is possible as a soft fork, which results in only a slightly more ugly protocol than a hard fork, is amazing at this point,\u201d Wandersleb said. \u201cIt allows anyone to delay implementing the change, making sure nobody will be left behind.\u201d\nAs such, Wandersleb is dedicated to implementing Segregated Witness in the Mycelium wallet.\n\u201cWe have [been] experimenting with the Segregated Witness testnet a bit; it will probably be a very reasonable amount of work to implement, and can be done on our own schedule. Moreover, delayed implementation will not result in our users losing money, beyond the potentially higher fees they would have to pay,\u201d he said.\nMoving Forward\n\nRoll-out of Segregated Witness on the Bitcoin network is currently scheduled for April of this year. Once a super-majority of miners agrees on the solution, Segregated Witness will be activated, and can be utilized by wallet software.\nAs what is perhaps the most notable difference between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Classic, the former plans to roll out Segregated Witness through a soft fork, while the latter wants to deploy a block size increase through a hard fork requiring all full nodes on the network to switch.\nWandersleb has voiced support for a block size increase hard fork in the past, but has come around since.\n\u201cMaybe I fell for the trap of talking about the block size, rather than more abstract goals we should commit to instead,\u201d Wandersleb explained. \u201cThe Number One priority is censorship resistance. Without that, Bitcoin would be just another PayPal. If censorship resistance is covered we can work on priority Number Two: process all the world\u2019s morning coffees and more.\u201d\nAnd, commenting on the scalability road map as set out by Bitcoin Core:\n\u201cI believe that Bitcoin Core, committed to these values, should acknowledge that increasing the block size or other hard forks might possibly be necessary. Nothing more. No tiny hard fork now, but an acknowledgement that avoiding hard forks at all costs might not be enough.\u201d\nFor more information on Segregated Witness, see Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s three-part series on the subject, or part 1, part 2 and part 3 of this development series.\n", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 29}

This could be especially important for remittances, where transaction costs can be high, around 8 percent. Distributed ledgers can also shorten the time required to settle securities transactions, which currently take up to three days, as well as lower counterparty and settlement risks.\nAt the same time, notes the IMF paper, virtual currencies based on distributed ledger technology can also serve as vehicles for money laundering, terrorism financing and tax evasion. Achieving a balanced regulatory framework that guards against risks without suffocating innovation is a challenge that will require extensive international cooperation.\nA conclusion of the IMF paper is that virtual currencies fall short of the legal concept of currency or money. While acknowledging that there is no generally accepted legal definition of currency or money, the authors note that both are associated with the power of the state to issue currency and regulate the monetary system. \nCurrently, according to the IMF, virtual currencies are unable to function as money because of the high price volatility, the relatively small size of the virtual economy, and the fact that virtual currencies are hardly being used as independent units of account in a closed-circuit economy. In fact, notes the report, the retailers who accept payment in virtual currency usually quote prices in fiat currency.\nAfter a simplified explanation of distributed ledger technologies for virtual currencies, the paper focuses on regulatory issues. \n\u201cThe potential for rapid change in the financial industry engendered by virtual currencies is a challenge for financial regulators and supervisors,\u201d note the IMF authors, adding that the absence of effective regulations has contributed to both benefits and risks. \nThe IMF authors make a difference between cryptocurrencies and \u201clegitimate\u201d uses of the underlying distributed ledger technology: \u201cThe growing interest in blockchain technology, independent from a [virtual currency] scheme, a priori raises fewer policy concerns, because the technology would be used in a closed system administered by regulated financial institutions.\u201d\nWhile advocating regulation of virtual currencies, the paper acknowledges that there are unique regulatory challenges, including the fact that the geographically decentralized nature of virtual currency networks like Bitcoin doesn\u2019t fit easily within traditional regulatory models based on local jurisdictions. Another challenge is the fact that the traceability of virtual currency transactions is is limited due to user anonymity and anonymizing service providers that obfuscate the transaction chain.\nIn fact, the push to increased regulation of virtual currencies is likely to be countered by the emergence of next-generation privacy-preserving digital currencies like Zcash.\n\nThe IMF paper concludes with a list of principles that could guide national authorities in further developing their regulatory responses. Besides the guidelines mentioned above, it\u2019s worth noting that the IMF authors realize that new closed-circuit business models, where virtual money is re-used instead of exchanged for fiat, could escape regulations, and propose to extend regulations to wallet providers.\nThe IMF paper confirms two current trends: Virtual currencies based on distributed ledger technology are increasingly considered by top financial institutions as a necessary part of future mainstream fintech, and at the same time regulatory pressures are increasing.\nPhoto Mikhail Klimentyev / Creative Commons", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 29}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nAlthough the block size debate has been the main point of conflict within the Bitcoin community over the past year, the reality is that this conversation is more about the larger topic of scalability. Different Bitcoin users would like to see the network scale via specific methods, and the two main parties in this debate are now Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Classic.\n\nAlong with the block size limit, the Lightning Network, and Segregated Witness, another Bitcoin feature that has been covered in controversy is Replace-by-Fee (RBF). Bitcoin Core Contributor Jonas Schnelli recently discussed this new feature, which has been implemented in Bitcoin Core 0.12, during a presentation at a Bitcoin Meetup Switzerland.\n\nSatoshi Originally Implemented Full RBF\n\nSchnelli started his talk by pointing out that Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto originally implemented RBF. \nAlthough transaction replacement was disabled by Nakamoto in 2010, the commit disabling the feature came with the comment that it was only being turned off \u201cfor now.\u201d The comment next to the code related to transaction replacement in Nakamoto\u2019s original code reads, \u201cAllow replacing with a newer version of the same transaction.\u201d\nSchnelli described how transaction replacement once worked on the Bitcoin network:\n\u201cIt was always possible \u2013 or back then it was possible \u2013 that if you did a transaction, until that transaction ended up in a block, you could change the transaction fully by just doing something different.\u201d\nRBF Helps Avoid Transaction Delays\n\nThere are advantages to being able to replace a Bitcoin transaction with a new, updated one. For example, if a user has included a transaction fee that is too low, the ability to replace the transaction with another one containing a higher fee allows users to make sure their transactions do not get stuck with a status of \u201cunconfirmed\u201d for long periods of time. Users are also able to correct errors made when creating a transaction via RBF.\nJonas Schnelli noted that this functionality makes sense to him:\n\u201cThis makes sense, in my opinion. If I do a payment and I find out, \u2018Oh, no \u2013 wrong amount,\u2019 or, \u2018Oh, no. The fees are wrong,\u2019 I can change it.\u201d\n0-Confirmation Doesn\u2019t Work with RBF\n\nThe controversial aspect of RBF is that it does not work well with 0-confirmation transactions. When users are able to replace transactions before they are placed into a block, that essentially makes unconfirmed transactions much riskier. Many merchants and payment processors rely on unconfirmed transactions for real-world commerce.\nSchnelli described this issue during his talk:\n\u201c0-confirmation by Satoshi\u2019s whitepaper was always insecure, but because people have built systems on it, we have to make sure that it\u2019s stable, that people can buy stuff instantly. I mean, you can\u2019t wait ten minutes when you pay for a coffee; I agree.\u201d\nOn the issue of the security of 0-confirmation transactions, Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd recently wrote a blog post where he outlined the current inability of bitcoin wallets to properly protect users against double spends.\n\nMerchants Shouldn\u2019t Be Afraid of RBF\n\nEven with the security concerns often pointed out by Todd and others, it should be noted that the current version of RBF is opt-in.\nJonas Schnelli explained the optional nature of RBF during his talk at Bitcoin Meetup Switzerland:\n\u201cWhen you create a transaction, you can decide, \u2018Should I be able to replace a transaction or not?\u2019 If you just create transactions as you did in the past, it\u2019s not replaceable. Nothing is broken; everything works as it was before. But now we can opt in \u2013 set the flag on that transaction \u2013 and then it gives you the chance to replace a transaction until it\u2019s mined.\u201d\nIn other words, merchants should not be vulnerable to an RBF-powered double spend because RBF transactions can be differentiated from traditional Bitcoin transactions.\nAs Schnelli explained during his presentation:\n\u201cMerchants can reject RBF transactions \u2026 If somebody pays you with a replace-by-fee transaction, you don\u2019t want to accept it if it\u2019s a 0-confirmation [transaction].\u201d\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe long-lasting block size dispute has catapulted into the center of attention again. One of the most talked-about developments is Segregated Witness, of which a public testnet iteration was launched last week. The innovation as recently proposed by Blockstream co-founder and Bitcoin Core developer Dr. Pieter Wuille is a centerpiece of a scalability \u201croadmap\u201d set out by Bitcoin Core.\nTo find out where the broader development community stands on Segregated Witness, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to library and wallet developers, those who will need to do the heavy lifting in order to utilize the innovation once rolled out.\nIn part 6 of this series: Electrum developer Thomas Voegtlin.\nSegregated Witness Highly Supportable\n\nElectrum \u2013 a hybrid model of light clients for end users and full node servers run by hosts \u2013 is one of the most-used wallets in the Bitcoin ecosystem today; according to Voegtlin\u2019s estimations, his software processes up to 10 percent of all Bitcoin transactions. The developer has started experimenting with the Segregated Witness testnet, and will try to integrate it into his wallet once rolled out on the Bitcoin network.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Voegtlin said:\n\u201cI like Segregated Witness because it makes Bitcoin cleaner, by separating transaction data from script data. That separation has the benefit of finally removing transaction malleability, which is much needed. It also opens the door for future extensions of the scripting language, enabling all sorts of new use cases. And of course, I\u2019m favorable to an increase in the network capacity.\u201d\nThe developer believes that the added effort to integrated Segregated Witness is within acceptable range.\n\u201cIt will be very easy to support transacting to Segregated Witness addresses,\u201d Voegtlin explained. \u201cBut to really support Segregated Witness, we need to change address generation in the wallet, and the way transactions are signed. The first step will be to update the Electrum servers, in order to index Segregated Witness scripts \u2013 then to update the client. I can combine the server work with a more general update which I planned to do anyway. All in all, that will probably keep me busy for a few months \u2013 but the added effort for Segregated Witness is manageable.\u201d\nSoft Fork Best Overall\n\nThe Bitcoin Core development team plans to roll out Segregated Witness as a soft fork in April of this year. Once a super-majority of miners agrees on this solution, wallets can utilize the benefits \u2013 including almost 1 megabyte of added block space for transactions.\nBut this strategy is now being contested by recently launched Bitcoin Core competitor Bitcoin Classic. Bitcoin Classic plans to deploy a 2-megabyte block size increase through a hard fork instead, meaning all full nodes on the network need to switch.\nVoegtlin explained that he has no strong position on the preferred block size limit itself \u2013 though he regrets that technical discussion has taken a backseat lately.\n\u201cI am not in a position to tell what the best block size is,\u201d Voegtlin said. \u201cUnfortunately, the block size debate has been dominated by quasi-religious attitudes, conflicts of interest, struggles of power and very little scientific data. I wish it was merely a technical issue. However, when a group of people proposes to hard fork Bitcoin against the will of its core developers, it stops being a technical issue, it becomes political.\u201d\nAs such, Voegtlin believes that a soft fork would be the best way to go, for now.\n\u201cIf we lived in a perfect world, where all developers agree on the direction Bitcoin should take, then a hard fork would be better, because it would be cleaner,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, after all the controversy we had, and the various attempts to impose a hard fork against the will of Bitcoin Core developers, I believe a soft fork is preferable. Not for technical reasons, but for political reasons.\u201d\nFor more information on Segregated Witness, see Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s three-part series on the subject, or part 1, part 2, part 3 and part 4 of this development series.\n", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 1}

The independence of the network from intermediaries and the traditional financial platform significantly reduces the costs involved in settling transactions and payments for companies like Alipay.\nThe Value of Stored Credit Information\n\u201cIf the blockchain will be widely used, with more and more financial institutions and commercial organizations applying the technology, ordinary people will participate, which will lead to the storage of information in it,\u201d said Alibaba Group Vice President and President of Research Institute Gao Hongbing. \u201cThe final value of blockchain is the storage of credit information, which is the heart of business and finance. In the past, we obtained this by ranking the companies.\u201d\nHe further emphasized the significance of big data, and the application of blockchain technology in the field. \n\u201cThe usage of the blockchain will grow with the transaction records stored in it,\u201d Hongbing said.\nToday, Alipay serves  more than 350 million registered users and settles more than 80 million transactions per day. The dominant Chinese payment network controls nearly 80 percent of the entire mobile payment provider market in China and supports 109 million active users on its Alipay Wallet platform.\nThe growth of cloud computing, Internet infrastructure and financial platforms such as Alipay of Alibaba recorded a revenue increase of 128 percent year-on-year during the third quarter of 2015. According to the official financial statement of Alibaba, the company recorded \u201c$289 million in revenue for cloud computing and Internet infrastructure.\u201d\nAs a response to the growing demand for simple yet robust financial platforms to process and settle cheap payments, Alipay is planning the launch of a Bitcoin blockchain-based cloud payment platform for existing Alipay users.\nGrowing Demand for Alipay\nOver the past year, a growing number of global corporations and conglomerates have begun to offer Alipay to clients as one of their main payment options. The world\u2019s largest airline by number of destinations, United Airlines, for example, announced that the company has officially integrated Alipay into its system due to the growing demand from Chinese citizens, who account for nearly 3 percent of foreign visitors to the United States.\n\u201cWe are very pleased to partner with United and help them make online booking from China a hassle-free experience,\u201d said Jingming Li, President of Alipay U.S. \u201cBy enabling the option to use China\u2019s most trusted and secure payment system, Chinese travelers using United\u2019s website can expect the safe, easy and consistent experience they have come to expect, while avoiding any currency barriers.\u201d \nEarlier this month, major Japanese department store chain Kintetsu also announced that the corporation has introduced the Chinese online payment solution in four of its department stores in Osaka.\n\u201cAlipay is a payment platform with over 400 million users in China. Chinese customers will be able to use the Alipay app on their cellphones to pay for the commodities they have bought in our department stores, which will be very convenient for them.\u201d said Aki Shokyoku, foreign business director of Abeno Harukas Kintetsu Main Store. \u201cWe want to make payment more convenient for Chinese tourists so as to attract more Chinese customers.\u201d\nAlthough Alipay is still unsure whether it will gear toward the integration of the Bitcoin network or the development of its own independent blockchain network, the company\u2019s executives present at the YunQi conference clearly stated that Alipay will most likely introduce a blockchain-backed cloud payment service in 2016.\nIf the Alipay team successfully integrates Bitcoin into their existing platform, it will immediately enable 400 million users in its system to use Bitcoin in settling international payments and transactions. Arguably, this could be the largest Bitcoin integration by volume to date.\nPhoto leighklotz / Flickr(CC)", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 1}

Blockstream is one of the first companies to announce a strategic partnership with PwC to bring blockchain technology and services to companies around the world. Together, PwC and Blockstream will help companies evaluate cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies against business needs. \nBlockstream, a company focused on implementing sidechains and accelerating innovation in digital currencies, was formed by the authors of the Bitcoin Sidechains whitepaper \u201cEnabling Blockchain Innovations with Pegged Sidechains,\u201d released in October 2014. In November 2014, Blockstream closed a $21 million seed funding round with nearly 40 high-profile investors.\n\nThe Bitcoin Sidechains paper envisages an ecosystem of \u201csidechains\u201d separate from the main Bitcoin blockchain but interoperable with it by means of two-way pegs, allowing for the transfer of assets between sidechains and the main blockchain. A sidechain can implement changes from Bitcoin Core, for example, more powerful scripting features or more watertight privacy.\nBlockstream launched Sidechain Elements, a sidechain development framework with open source code and developer sidechains, and a first commercial production sidechain, called Liquid, which is meant to improve capital efficiency and market liquidity by facilitating rapid and secure transfers between accounts held at any participating exchange or brokerage.\n\u201cFor our clients, understanding new world applications of Bitcoin and blockchain technology, adapting it for myriad uses, and using it optimally are critical to improving financial security, efficiency and compliance,\u201d said PwC FinTech Co-Leader Haskell S.

Integrate multiple blockchain, distributed file storage, and other distributed systems into a cohesive application. Eris also makes it simple and easy for your organization to get started using permissionable, smart-contract capable blockchains.\u201d\nThese two partnerships indicate main focus areas for PwC\u2019s blockchain fintech program. PwC stated that they decided to look into Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology in response to the growing demand of their clients and investors. PwC has reviewed almost 1,000 blockchain startups against client\u2019s needs to create a solution portfolio to support the blockchain needs of financial institutions around the world.\nPhoto Rick Gonzalez / Flickr(CC)", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 1}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nBlockchain Capital Managing Partner Brock Pierce said in a recent interview that although there are legitimate concerns with the current state of Bitcoin mining, the blockchain-focused venture capitalist indicated China\u2019s stranglehold on the mining process will not last forever.\nPierce was interviewed on the most recent episode of This Week in Startups, where he was asked about the issue of bitcoin mining centralization. The source of the question appeared to be Mike Hearn\u2019s farewell Medium post in which the former Bitcoin developer claimed the Bitcoin payment network is \u201ccontrolled by China.\u201d\nPierce Would Not Invest in a Chinese Bitcoin Mining Operation\n\nPierce said bitcoin mining in China is probably not always sanctioned by the Chinese government. In fact, Pierce suspects various mining operations in the country may be going on without the government\u2019s knowledge and behind closed doors.\nPierce said he would not invest in one of these mining operations due to the legal uncertainty surrounding them. \nHe noted:\n\u201cIn China, you\u2019ve got a lot of the hydro dams. They offer one to two \u2013 we\u2019ll call it two to four megawatt facilities. The problem you have in China is you\u2019re not allowed to buy energy from anyone except for the government, and so when these deals are being done, they\u2019re being done outside of the government, so they\u2019re probably in violation of the law. There\u2019s some risks there about its long-term sustainability. I would not be comfortable investing in one of those operations because there\u2019s a bunch of risk factors there that I don\u2019t know how to quantify.\u201d\nIn Pierce\u2019s view, the fact that these operations may not have the blessing of the local government could impact their long-term viability as profitable investments.\nBitcoin Mining May Not Scale in China\n\nPierce said the legal ambiguity surrounding Bitcoin mining in China also means it may not be able to continue to scale with increased Bitcoin adoption over time. Pierce put Bitcoin mining\u2019s scalability in China into question due to his belief that this is not something being financed by the Chinese government:\n\u201cThe question is: Are they stealing? Are they circumventing? In some cases, are there backdoor deals? And obviously, these sorts of things do happen in that region. There are those risks where, long term, I wonder how scalable it can get because I don\u2019t believe this is like \u2013 I don\u2019t believe the Chinese government has decided this is a matter of national security and are financing this. I believe this is a lot of sort of backdoor dealing and guys hustling to make a buck.\u201d\nAn inability to scale to much larger levels of hashing power would likely mean the rest of the world would eventually catch up to China and retake majority control of the overall network hashrate. Pierce pointed to BitFury and KnCMiner as two companies that could eventually help bring more of the Bitcoin network\u2019s hashing power outside of China.\nNot a Long-term Risk\n\nPierce said the China-related question is this is not an issue that keeps him up at night. \nHe noted:\n\u201cI don\u2019t go, \u2018Oh, this is a long-term, legitimate risk.\u2019 \u2026 I don\u2019t think China has a monopoly.\u201d\nAnd besides, Pierce noted, there wouldn\u2019t be much to worry about even if the majority of mining continued to take place in China. In his view, Bitcoin\u2019s incentive structure persuades everyone in the system to act properly.\nHe explained:\n\u201cThe thing that I rely on more than anything else is more than a contract; it\u2019s an alignment of incentives. How do the the Chinese miners that are investing all this money and hustling to make a buck benefit by destroying Bitcoin? The most important thing that I think we have as an industry is everybody\u2019s interests are aligned that are currently investing in this.\u201d\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nSegregated Witness has become the most talked-about breakthrough in Bitcoin development since the concept was presented in early December to the Scaling Bitcoin Workshop in Hong Kong by Bitcoin Core Developer Pieter Wuille. One of the men that Wuille thanked in the last slide of that presentation was Bitcoin Developer and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo.\n\nLombrozo gave a presentation on the future of Bitcoin scalability at the recent Blockchain Agenda Conference in San Diego, where he outlined some of the key benefits of Segregated Witness (SegWit). Although much of the Bitcoin community thinks of SegWit in terms of getting more transactions into each block, the reality is that this innovation offers more than that. When first mentioning this concept to the audience at the San Diego Convention Center, Lombrozo stated:\n\u201cThis is one of those ideas that \u2013 in hindsight \u2013 once you understand it, you think this is how it always should have been done.\u201d\n1. Stuffing More Transactions Into Blocks\n\nLombrozo first pointed out that most nodes are interested only in the transactions that affect themselves. He explained:\n\u201cScripts take up a lot of space and consume bandwidth. Most nodes are not interested in every single script and every single signature of every transaction on the blockchain. They\u2019re usually mostly interested in the [transactions] that concern them.\u201d\nLombrozo explained that SegWit allows nodes to ignore data that they were unlikely to use anyway. He added that this new feature would essentially free up more space for transactions in each new block:\n\n\u201cEvery single time that you have to download blocks and transactions, you download all of this data that most nodes are just going to end up throwing away anyway. This can actually give us about two-thirds or more additional space, so we can put [more transactions] in the blockchain.\u201d\nAlthough the Bitcoin community has focused on an increase in the block size limit to increase transactional capacity, SegWit is able to achieve the same goal through alternative means.\n2. Fixing Transaction Malleability\n\nTransaction malleability has been a thorn in the sides of Bitcoin developers for years. During the collapse of Mt. Gox, Mark Karpeles attempted to blame the loss of customer funds on this issue in the Bitcoin protocol. Transaction malleability has also been used to perform DoS attacks on the Bitcoin network.\nDuring his talk, Lombrozo noted that SegWit has the ability to slay the dragon of malleable transactions once and for all:\n\u201cIt fixes transaction malleability. Now, you can sign transactions independently of transaction identification, so you can construct these very long transaction chains and make it so that the order they get signed in doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\nA fix for transaction malleability is also required for the Lightning Network to function properly, so it\u2019s possible that SegWit will be able to improve Bitcoin\u2019s ability to scale in more ways than one.\n3. A Mechanism for Adding New Opcodes\n\nAdding new opcodes to Bitcoin has been a difficult proposition in the past, but SegWit creates a better method of upgrading the scripting language. Lombrozo noted:\n\u201cIt provides a powerful script upgrade mechanism. Up until now, we really didn\u2019t have a good way to upgrade or add new opcodes to the scripting language.\u201d\nLombrozo then took his statement to another level, saying:\n\u201cWith this, I believe we can actually replace the scripting language entirely with a soft fork.\u201d\nOpcodes are what enable various types of transactions on the Bitcoin network. One of the most recent opcodes added to Bitcoin was OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY. As a side note, new opcodes are required to bring sidechains functionality to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n4. A More Flexible Security Model\n\nLombrozo also talked about how SegWit can enable new security models for Bitcoin transactions. He explained:\n\u201cIt makes it possible to add new, partial proofs for future soft forks. This allows for fraud proofs and other kinds of cryptographic proofs, which would allow us to have more flexibility in the security model, so we can decide how much we want to trust other peers and how much we want to validate for ourselves.\u201d\nValidation on some transactions can be much lower than others, so it makes sense to allow users to choose the level of security they need in different situations. For example, someone purchasing their morning coffee does not require the same level of validation as a financial institution settling a day\u2019s worth of transactions with another entity. Transactions with less validation can bring more efficiency and scalability to the Bitcoin blockchain, but it\u2019s important to understand the security tradeoffs.\n5. Bandwidth Requirements Are Lowered\n\nSegregated Witness also has the potential to decrease bandwidth requirements for SPV nodes. Lombrozo explained this point during his talk:\n\u201cWhen we separate the effects from the scripts and signatures, now we can download these things from different peers at our own leisure \u2013 however we want. This allows us to optimize for the peer-to-peer layer significantly, since now we no longer need to be propagating everything all the time. We only propagate the things that are necessary at that moment for the particular peer.\u201d\nThere may be some downsides to SegWit, too, but these advantages are hard to ignore. Both Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Classic have plans for implementing this new concept into their respective software clients.\nCorrection: A previous version of this article claimed Segregated Witness lowers bandwidth requirements for full nodes. This is not true, and the decreased need for bandwidth availability only applies to SPV nodes.\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

The terms of the deal were not disclosed.\nSBI Investment is a unit of SBI Holdings, an Internet-based financial conglomerate with operating revenues of more than $2 billion in 2015 and operating income of around $570 million. The SBI Group consists of 208 companies operating in approximately 20 countries and regions, in sectors including financial services, asset management and biotechnology.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s website, SBI Investment takes many factors into consideration, including market growth potential, uniqueness, differentiation from competitors and feasibility of business model.\nA communication issued by SBI Holdings notes that Kraken has a high level of safety and has never been hacked since it has stringent security control measures in place. It has attained a position as a market leader, including the largest global market share in terms of the volume of Bitcoin transactions and liquidity in the European market.\n\u201cSBI\u2019s investment means a lot to us,\u201d said Kraken founder and CEO Jesse Powell. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to have such a strong strategic partner leading our round. It\u2019s a fantastic first step toward completing Series B, which will ultimately enable us to scale our business worldwide. Kraken will be prepared to meet the fast-increasing demands of an emerging ecosystem of blockchain-enabled assets.\u201d\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, an industry insider noted that this announcement was particularly impressive given the \u201cbrutal\u201d fundraising climate for bitcoin exchanges. Before this investment round, Kraken had raised $6.5 million from backers such as Hummingbird Ventures, Blockchain Capital and Digital Currency Group.\nFounded in 2011, San Francisco-based Kraken was the first Bitcoin exchange to have trading price and volume displayed on the Bloomberg Terminal, and the first to pass a cryptographically verifiable proof-of-reserves audit. According to the company\u2019s website, Kraken is trusted by hundreds of thousands of traders, the Tokyo government\u2019s court-appointed trustee, and Germany\u2019s Fidor Bank. In October 2014, Fidor Bank and Kraken partnered to create the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency bank.\n\nSiliconANGLE notes that the investment from SBI comes at a busy time from Kraken, following the announcement that it had acquired New York-based Bitcoin exchange Coinsetter Inc. and Canadian exchange Cavirtex in mid-January and the launch of new products in 2015, including a dark pool exchange service and a maker-taker fee model.\nBuying Coinsetter is just one part of the equation in order to add volume, noted TechCrunch. Kraken also needs to make it easier to deposit U.S. dollars on the platform. The company is partnering with SynapsePay to allow USD deposits in 37 U.S. states and Washington D.C. for just $5.\n\u201cWe knew that we wanted to invest in Bitcoin and the blockchain,\u201d said SBI Holdings CEO Yoshitaka Kitao. \u201cWe wanted a company that would be a wise strategic investment. Kraken has been a leading global Bitcoin exchange for years. They have grown tremendously during that time while building a strong reputation as one of the most innovative, secure, compliant and reliable companies in this emerging financial services area. Kraken was the clear choice.\u201c\nKraken now claims to be the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin exchange by euro volume and transactions, and that in the last two years traders have made more than $1.4 billion in transactions on the platform while trading bitcoin and other digital assets in euros, U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds and Canadian dollars.\nSBI notes that Kraken is developing blockchain-based financial infrastructure that permits reducing system costs significantly, and dramatically shortening payment processing times, which is attracting attention from the many financial institutions that need to process large volumes of data in short times. The investment represents a vote of confidence in the potential of both blockchain fintech and Kraken.\nPhoto via Kraken\n", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 2}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe long-lasting block size dispute has catapulted into the center of attention again. One of the most talked-about developments is Segregated Witness, of which a public testnet iteration was launched last week. The innovation as recently proposed by Blockstream co-founder and Bitcoin Core developer Dr. Pieter Wuille is a centerpiece of a scalability \u201croadmap\u201d set out by Bitcoin Core.\nTo find out where the broader development community stands on Segregated Witness, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to library and wallet developers; those who will need to do the heavy lifting in order to utilize the innovation once rolled out.\nIn part 6 of this series: Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin C library developer Jonas Schnelli.\nLess Than a Week of Work\n\nJonas Schnelli is an independent Bitcoin Core developer who also develops the libbtc library that runs on iOS, Android, Mac, PC, Linux and MCUs. Schnelli additionally founded digitalbitbox.com, which is in the process of creating a simple and secure hardware wallet.\nLike many other wallet and library developers, Schnelli believes the integration of Segregated Witness would significantly benefit the Bitcoin protocol.\nSchnelli:\n\u201cI have read the relevant Bitcoin Improvement Proposals in detail, and have started experimenting with Segregated Witness to get a better feeling for how it works and how long it might take to adapt it for my projects. I think from the wallet perspective \u2013 SPV, hardware-wallet, wallet-libraries \u2013 integration is pretty simple. Probably less then one week of work, including testing and deploying. This is also evident from looking at the basic Bitcoin Core wallet changes; it\u2019s just a couple of lines of code.\u201d\nSchnelli agrees that a roll-out of Segregated Witness is the best first step toward broader Bitcoin scalability.\n\u201cI completely agree the added effort for wallet and library developers is worth it, considering the risks of hard forking,\u201d Schnelli explained. \u201cPeople are often favoring simple infrastructure improvements rather then going into optimizing the software itself. But that\u2019s a common mistake we have seen in the IT industries in the past decades. It\u2019s short-term thinking and will very likely cause bigger problems in the future.\u201d\nSoft Fork: Chance for a Better Protocol\n\nRoll-out of Segregated Witness on the Bitcoin network is currently scheduled for April of this year. Once a super-majority of miners agrees on the solution, Segregated Witness will be activated, and can be utilized by wallet software.\nThe most notable difference between Bitcoin Core and its recently launched competitor Bitcoin Classic is that the former plans to roll out Segregated Witness through a soft fork, while the latter wants to deploy a block-size increase through a hard fork, meaning all full nodes on the network need to switch.\nSchnelli considers the choice an obvious one: a Segregated Witness soft fork is preferable for now.\n\u201cA 2-megabyte hard fork does not improve the protocol itself, not a tiny bit,\u201d Schnelli said. \u201cWith Segregated Witness, we have a chance to get a \u2018better,\u2019 more optimized protocol, and reach almost the same amount of transactions per block. And, extremely important, Segregated Witness has almost full consensus.\u201d\nHe continued:\n\u201cI personally cannot understand why some developers are still thinking that a 2- megabyte hard fork is preferable. The main risks of a hard fork are not technical, but there are huge risks of disrupting the whole Bitcoin economy. The Bitcoin market is extremely fragile, and it fully trusts in developer consensus. Bitcoin is still very young. If we start fighting and disagree on the very deepest technical layer, we hurt Bitcoin in its core and will lose irreplaceable trust from the markets.\u201d\nSchnelli noted, however, that he has no fundamental problems with alternative Bitcoin implementations, including Bitcoin Classic. It\u2019s mostly the proposed block size increase prior to consensus that he condemns.\n\u201cI\u2019m still hoping there could be a full agreement between Classic and Core on the consensus layer. Code forks are healthy \u2013 chain forks not,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we go down the road of a \u2018Let\u2019s see who will make the race; Classic or Core\u2019 there will only be one winner in the end: other cryptocurrency protocols like Ethereum and Ripple.\u201d\nFor more information on Segregated Witness, see Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s three-part series on the subject, or part 1, part 2, part 3, part 4 and part 5 of this development series.\n", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 3}

They are instantly settled and can be executed at high frequency. Imagine a couple of payments per second by a single user,\u201d said SatoshiPay co-founder and CEO Meinhard Benn. \u201cThis enables completely new ways of monetizing Web content and digital goods in general. In an increasingly digital society, nanopayments allow for new business models that existing payment technology cannot facilitate due to its fee structure and trust models.\u201d \nSatoshiPay Ltd. is headquartered in London and development is done through the Berlin subsidiary SatoshiPay Germany UG, founded by Benn, Henning Peters and Kilian Thalhammer in 2014. In July 2015, the company won second prize at Coinbase Bithack. \n\u201cSatoshiPay is a bitcoin nanopayment wall for publishers which allows you to pay for the section of text that really interests you, make metered payments for streaming video, and make paid downloads with a single click,\u201d noted the Coinbase announcement. SatoshiPay recently announced that it closed a \u20ac360,000 seed funding round.\n\u201cSatoshiPay would like to become a standard for paying for digital goods on the Web,\u201d Benn told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cIt\u2019s widely assumed that micro or nanopayments are one of the applications that could become Bitcoin\u2019s killer-app. We strongly agree and we hope that we built a use case that can prove this.\u201d\nMicropayments are difficult to implement with traditional payment systems, because the overhead costs (transaction fees) would be too high. But fast micropayments with the low transaction fees permitted by Bitcoin enable alternative models for paid online content.\nWe are used to a \u201cfree\u201d Internet where nobody has to pay, but, of course, there is no such thing as a free lunch. The price that we pay for free email is spam, and the price that we pay for free content is rampant advertising \u2013 often annoying, intrusive, and ugly \u2013 or registration to websites that could sell their registered users list to spammers. Needless to say, many users install ad-blockers and don\u2019t register to websites with mandatory sign-up. The company recommends trying the SatoshiPay model as an alternative to ads and registration.\nIn SatoshiPay there is no registration, and payments are done with one click or tap. The user can also choose to pay for content completely automatically. The balance of the user\u2019s SatoshiPay wallet is displayed in the SatoshiPay\u2019s floating Web widget at the bottom of the publisher\u2019s website (example here). The user\u2019s balance is shared across all websites that integrate with the SatoshiPay widget, and a user interface to manage SatoshiPay wallets is in the works. Publishers can join the SatoshiPay nanopayment network and install a Wordpress plugin, and more options for both publishers and users are expected to be available later on.\n\u201cA lot of people are talking about how smart contracts and payment channels can power tomorrow\u2019s applications,\u201d Benn told Bitcoin Magazine. We\u2019ve built something that is already very useful today.\u201d\nFlorian Glatz, a developer who is also SatoshiPay\u2019s lawyer, wrote an article to explain how SatoshiPay is prototyping innovative uses of smart contracts \u201cto change the Internet economy forever.\u201d The SatoshiPay service is a trustless intermediary that mediates contractual negotiations and performance between buyers and sellers of digital goods, without those parties having to trust the service with their money, by implementing micropayment channels built on 2-of-2 multisig addresses and the nLockTime property.\n\nThe SatoshiPay service seems a clever and streamlined way to monetize online content without annoying readers, and the first impression is that it could really change the Internet economy once it achieves a critical mass of users and publishers.\n\u201cWe automatically generate a Bitcoin wallet for each website visitor \u2013 without them even knowing,\u201d Benn told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWhen users that were previously not familiar with Bitcoin realize they have a wallet now, they might be curious to learn more about Bitcoin and its other applications. So besides being an easy-to-use payment tool, our product also helps to spread the word. As someone on Twitter put it: Blockchain is moving into publishing.\u201d\n\u201cGo to satoshipay.io and show me your QR code,\u201d is Benn\u2019s message to people that wonder how to get bitcoins. \u201cI will send you some bitcoins right now and you can start using them.

It believes customers are looking for more digitalization and convenience, not necessarily a new currency.\nIn a forthcoming white paper called FinTech 2.0, Deutsche Bank signals to investors and clients that it is looking at partnering with new fintech startups to accelerate the transition to digital banking, including blockchain technology.\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s report is a wake-up call for the banking sector, warning that unless banks learn to partner with fintechs and \u201cdigital disruptors\u201d they will begin to disappear altogether from the financial services landscape.\nComing on the heels of Deutsche Bank\u2019s reported record loss for 2015 and a drop in Deutsche Bank\u2019s share price, the report notes that it\u2019s time for the bank to adopt a new business model that recognizes the importance of digital disruption in financial services.\nIn a wide-ranging interview with Bitcoin Magazine , Deutsche Bank Managing Director Rhomaios Ram said that the bank is more than ready to adopt new payment innovations and considers the adoption of blockchain technology inevitable.\n\u201cAs the white paper notes, the biggest hurdles to adoption of new technologies and partnerships are regulatory and legal requirements in different jurisdictions around the world,\u201d said Ram.\n\u201cFintechs, and huge digital ecosystems in particular, have entered the market with a bang,\u201d he said, noting that the report calls for a \u201cmindset\u201d adjustment to understand the major change in the marketplace and \u201cthat digitalization can become the new differentiator for banks.\u201d\nThe white paper calls on the banking sector to \u201cmodernize the entire financial system infrastructure\u201d andpartner with new digital market forces. including cryptocurrency startups, saying, \u201cBanks must change their attitude to fintech companies in order to survive.\u201d\nFintech startups happy to partner with Deutsche Bank\n\nRam told Bitcoin Magazine he had met with many fintech startups and was pleasantly surprised that they were more than happy to partner with the bank.\n\u201cI\u2019ve discussed the possibility of partnerships with tens of different fintech startups, and they all seem very keen to partner with us,\u201d Ram said. \u201cIt\u2019s great that they see the benefits that we can bring to a potential partnership, including a client base, security and regulatory certainty.\u201d\nThe report lists the following projects as examples of \u201cpayment innovators\u201d: PayPal, M-Pesa, Bitcoin, Alipay, Stripe, Payoneer, Samsung Pay, Apple Pay, Square and Google Wallet.\nIn the spirit of cooperation, JPMorgan Chase already has teamed up with Digital Asset Holdings on a trial blockchain initiative that aims to make the trading process more efficient and cost-effective.\nWhat\u2019s in it for the new fintech company? The white paper notes:\n\u201cIn order to maintain their position, they must find a way to meet their regulatory, investment and risk needs in order to focus on their core competencies. They may find partnering with a global banking provider to be the most strategic approach in this regard, and many of the developments of coming years will likely evolve within such alliances. Several market leaders have realised that bank alliances are the way forwards.\u201d\nDeutsche Bank experiments with three blockchain labs\n\nAccording to Ram, Deutsche Bank currently operates three innovation labs in Berlin, London and one soon to be launched in Silicon Valley.\nCalling blockchain technology \u201cgenius,\u201d Ram said they haven\u2019t settled on one version yet of the various technologies being developed.\n\u201cWe\u2019re blockchain \u2018agnostics\u2019 \u2013 we\u2019re interested in and studying the benefits of all the various blockchain technologies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Stellar and others \u2013 to ensure we\u2019re adopting the best possible version for our use,\u201d he said.\nIn early December 2015, Deutsche Bank announced it had successfully tested a corporate bond platform that was based on blockchain technology. Blockchain technology \u201csmart contracts\u201d were used to issue and redeem bonds that paid out coupons automatically.\nOn bitcoin as a currency, Ram isn\u2019t sure what the future holds for the digital currency, saying:\n\u201cAs far as bitcoin as a future currency, I\u2019m not sure whether universal adoption is a sure thing.

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nCoin Center Director of Research Peter Van Valkenburgh has prepared a report regarding the regulation of various cryptocurrencies within a traditional securities framework. Although the report found cryptocurrencies attached to public blockchains, such as bitcoin and ether, should not be regulated as securities, the team behind the document did find that the definition of a security may apply to some of the more centralized crypto-assets currently on the market.\nMost of Coin Center\u2019s report provided a general overview of Bitcoin and related technologies for regulators, but the end of the report mainly focused on the Howey test. The Howey test is a way to figure out whether something should be defined as a security and is defined by the following parameters in the report:\n\u201cAn investment contract for purposes of the Securities Act means a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person [1] invests his money in [2] a common enterprise and is led to [3] expect profits [4] solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party, [excluded factors] it being immaterial whether the shares in the enterprise are evidenced by formal certificates or by nominal interests in the physical assets employed in the enterprise.\u201d\nBitcoin and many altcoins are not well-suited for the Howey test, which is why the report recommends regulators do not treat these cryptocurrencies as securities. The Howey test becomes a bit more viable when talking about blockchain initiatives that have low transparency, involve a pre-sale of tokens, or a more centralized approach to transaction validation (such as a permissioned ledger).\n\nThe Coin Center report on treating cryptocurrencies as securities went through all four prongs of the Howey test to determine which types of crypto-assets should be regulated.\nInvestment of Money\n\nAccording to Coin Center\u2019s report, the way a cryptocurrency is distributed to its users should be the first variable to consider when analyzing that token in the eyes of the Howey test. The report claims altcoins that offer any sort of pre-sale of their tokens are more likely to qualify as an investment of money, which is the first prong of the Howey test. Pre-mined coins are also included in this group, especially when combined with a minimum price floor guarantee (as was the case with Paycoin).\n\nCoin Center\u2019s report says tokens issued via a mining process, such as Bitcoin, do not constitute as an investment of money. Tokens issued via proof-of-burn, a sidechain or as a reward for contributing resources in some other manner (Storj for example) are also lumped into this category of cryptocurrencies that do not involve an investment of money by users.\nCreating a Common Enterprise\n\nThe next aspect of the Howey test covered by the report is whether an investment counts as a common enterprise. This prong of the test is defined in the report:\n\u201cBriefly, horizontal commonality can be defined as the pooling of investor funds such that the fates of all investors rise or fall together, often \u2014 though not always \u2014 through a pro-rata sharing of profits. Vertical commonality requires that the \u2018fortunes of the investor are interwoven with and dependent upon the efforts and success of those seeking the investment or of third parties.\u2019\u201d\nWhile horizontal commonality in Bitcoin is easy to prove \u2014 everyone\u2019s bitcoin will rise and fail in value together \u2014 vertical commonality is another story. The report notes there are many companies that promote bitcoin as a currency or commodity, but the profits for these companies are tied to internal factors rather than a simple increase in the U.S. dollar value of bitcoin.\nPaycoin is pointed out as one possible situation where the requirements of vertical commonality are met. The altcoin\u2019s parent company, Geniuses at Work, held the majority of all paycoin, which means their profits and losses were closely tied to the success or failure of the cryptocurrency. Although not mentioned in the report, Ripple holds a large amount of XRP and falls under similar consideration.\nCoin Center\u2019s report also mentions token scarcity, decentralization and developers holding a large percentage of all tokens as troubling signs for investors. In general, altcoins that involve vertical commonality are noted as high-risk investments.\nExpectation of Profits\n\nNearly every altcoin that has been launched up to this point has come with an expectation of profits, and speculation is still one of the main use cases of bitcoin today. Coin Center\u2019s report only pointed out two possible cases where an altcoin does not meet this prong of the Howey test: sidechains and appcoins.\nThe reasoning behind Coin Center\u2019s exclusion of sidechain-based altcoins is clear \u2014 the value of a sidechain token is pegged to bitcoin \u2014 but some may say the decision to include appcoins as tokens that don\u2019t come with any expectation of profit is questionable. For example, the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute \u2019s Daniel Krawisz has referred to appcoins as snake oil.\nThird-Party Control\n\nThe final prong of the Howey test covered in Coin Center\u2019s report involves the level of trust required in the transaction validators. Although these systems are oftentimes referred to as \u201ctrustless,\u201d the reality is that all blockchains, even Bitcoin, have some trusted entity (or entities) processing transactions on the network. According to Coin Center, the risks for users are higher when these entities are more centralized.\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work system was praised for its level of decentralization, Coin Center\u2019s report was not as kind to proof-of-stake and permissioned ledger systems. The report cites often-discussed flaws of proof-of-stake systems that could lead to more centralization than originally intended, but it also notes research in this area is still ongoing. When it comes to permissioned ledgers, the report claims:\n\u201cA Permissioned distributed ledger system will always lead to the reliance of users upon the class of enumerated transaction validations. This group effectively controls the ledger and can issue new tokens at will. All access to the network is mediated by this group, and the total value of the network would therefore be predicated on the faith or trust that users choose to place in that group.\u201d\nConclusions\n\nThe final portion of the report covers specific advice for regulators. These innovations are presented as having a lower risk profile for investors and users:\n\nHighly decentralized cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Litecoin ) \nSidechained cryptocurrencies (Rootstock, Bitcoin Hivemind) \nCryptocurrencies with a distribution model based on open, competitive mining or proof-of-burn (Bitcoin) \nAppcoins (Ethereum, Storj) \n\nAlternatively, Coin Center\u2019s report states investors (or users) may need more protection from the following types of cryptocurrencies:\n\nClosed-source or low-transparency cryptocurrencies \nCryptocurrencies with a pre-sale that involve a small and non-diverse mining and developer community \nCryptocurrencies with permissioned ledgers or some other form of highly centralized transaction validators \n\nThese are simply recommendations made by Coin Center, so no government agency has any responsibility to follow them. Having said that, this report has been able to make a clear distinction between open, decentralized cryptocurrencies and their more centralized, and perhaps riskier, counterparts.\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

She started by criticizing Bitcoin\u2019s usefulness as a currency:\n\u201cI absolutely see a future for blockchain,\u201d she said. \u201cBitcoin is just something that uses blockchain, and I don\u2019t think the current construct of Bitcoin particularly has longevity. It behaves more like a commodity than a currency.\u201d\nThe MasterCard official then took aim at the transaction speeds on the Bitcoin network. Although Bitcoin transactions are broadcast instantly, it takes an average of five minutes for a transaction to be confirmed in a block (a new block is mined every 10 minutes). \n\u201cIt\u2019s very slow,\u201d Cairns said. \u201cI mean, you read a lot of stuff in the press, but right now, it takes about 10 minutes to do a transaction. Imagine you\u2019re waiting for a train. Do you just want to go through the barrier and tap your card, or do you want to wait 10 minutes for your bitcoins?\u201d\nAlthough Cairns claims about confirmation times are true, there are a number of workarounds for this problem currently in development. Off-chain solutions, such as Stash and the Lightning Network, currently hold the most promise in this area. There are also plenty of options for merchants to accept unconfirmed transactions.\n\nIn addition to her points on the technical workings of Bitcoin, Cairns also discussed the issue of the cryptocurrency\u2019s association with Silk Road and other controversial use cases.\nMasterCard Testing Blockchains\n\nWhen asked about blockchain technology, as opposed to Bitcoin specifically, Cairns\u2019 tone completely changed.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at blockchain right now in all sorts of different ways in our labs because we think blockchain is basically a value transfer system,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty neat, actually. There\u2019s nothing wrong with using new algorithms to actually move money. We think that\u2019s a great thing; it\u2019s just how you actually manifest it and make it work, along with the way you have to handle all of the world\u2019s regulations to make it effective, safe and fast, that is the issue.\u201d\nAlthough Digital Currency Group (DCG) founder Barry Silbert is quite bullish on bitcoin as a currency, that didn\u2019t stop MasterCard from investing in the Bitcoin-focused investment company late last year. MasterCard Chief Innovation Officer Garry Lyons recently told Business Insider, \u201c[DCG] is connected to 15 different others and they have their fingers in the right pies, so we\u2019ve got the right engagement right now to see people experimenting with the underlying tech.\u201d\nTransferWise CEO Questions MasterCard President\n\nMuch like MasterCard\u2019s Cairns, TransferWise CEO Taavet Hinrikus is more interested in blockchain technology than Bitcoin. In fact, he thinks MasterCard should, perhaps, be worried about this new innovation.\n\u201cWith blockchain, I think that\u2019s much more exciting,\u201d Hinrikus said during the panel. \u201cI wonder \u2013 could we see a world where blockchain disrupts MasterCard?\u201d\nCairns responded that MasterCard would simply adopt blockchain technology if it were that disruptive. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re looking at it,\u201d she said.\nThe MasterCard president added that the company does not care much about the technology behind payments as long as people continue to use their network.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any difference to us if we\u2019ve incorporated it into part of the way we move money [around] our network, the actual swiping, tapping or sending a message over a phone or computer; it\u2019s just a form factor. That doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the interconnectivity that matters and the safety and security.\u201d\nAny company involved in payments, banking or other aspects of finance now has the blockchain on its radar, but only a handful of them are interested in Bitcoin\u2019s public, open and permissionless ledger. The interoperability between Bitcoin and permissioned ledgers will be a trend to watch in the coming years.\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

Senthil has 16+ years\u2019 experience focused in capital markets technology with investment banks such as UBS, JPMC, Barclays, and others.\n\nAs one of the hottest technological developments making the rounds in financial circles, the blockchain has a lot of people hooked. But there is not yet much clarity on how blockchain technology will impact private business, given that it is so unlike traditional IT architectures. \nPrivate blockchain applications are amalgams of cryptography, immutable transaction log/ledgers, federated transaction approval mechanisms, distributed databases and peer-to-peer software. Since any proprietary business function using blockchain technology is by definition private, the network is only accessible to a limited audience. That\u2019s why it is a good idea to consider the following elements when deciding to test processes on a blockchain model.\n\n\nNot all functions should be made on the blockchain. High volume non-transactional data attributes (like trading instrument data) are stored in platforms like reference data systems. Such systems can sit outside the blockchain. Avoid the redundancy of duplicating a large data island \u2013 like reference data \u2013 across many nodes. \n\n\nBlockchain systems will run along those in the non-blockchain world. To enable this, there has to be free flow of assets between the two ecosystems. Some issues to consider:\n\nHow does one control the quantity of assets to be issued?\nAssets may have to enter and exit the blockchain system; how can this be tracked?\nThe life cycle of an asset.\n\n\n\nProtect against user mistakes. The nodes/wallets in a blockchain are referenced by public key hash. This makes the system susceptible to mistakes. On the Internet, domain name services make it easy to remember names instead of numeric IP addresses (e.g. 192.168.2.33). A similar paradigm is required here.\n\n\nKeep it lightweight. The blockchain ledger replicates itself on every node as new blocks get added.In a business model, there could be a need to store a lot of information, but items such as documents can make the blockchain heavy. Linking it to an external data storage system solves this problem. The downside of an external data source, however, is lessened reliability given that the data is not all in one specific place.\n\n\nManaging a private key can be unwieldy. In a large organization with processes and policies this can slow things down. Some critical questions to ask: What happens if the key file is lost or is corrupted? Who will have access to the key file? It needs to be both secure and available for extensive use. \n\n\nBlockchain as a database is still limiting. Private blockchain applications are being used like databases by some businesses who benefit from blockchain features such as replication and immutability. But limiting data storage to the blockchain for any large-scale application may not be practical. Most businesses also need typical database features, including querying, reporting, triggers and mapped relationships between entities. This could add to the complexity of building large-scale systems.\n\n\nAllow realistic timelines. A typical private blockchain use involves a set of organizations agreeing to use the same software. It\u2019s common to see organizations communicating or interfacing with each other using a common protocol/data format. Getting an agreement on common protocol between organizations takes several iterations and time. Convincing organizations to use the same blockchain software stack is an even bigger challenge. \n\n\nChoose wisely between the Bitcoin blockchain and custom blockchain software. Extending the existing Bitcoin blockchain software to serve business purposes is a logical first thought. Bitcoin has evolved over time and is tested, robust and stabile. But Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain has features like public read access which may not be suitable for certain business needs. Too much customization or redevelopment of the original blockchain introduces the risk of an untested complex technology platform. So give due consideration to the pros and cons of Bitcoin workarounds vs. untested custom blockchain software before selecting a model.\n\n\nThe greatest features of the blockchain \u2013 its openness, democratic nature and potential efficiencies \u2013 have endeared it to everyone. One can only hope that a future blockchain-driven world retains these principles. Focusing on closed-door startups will in effect transfer the centralist nature of existing business models (like government, banks, etc.) to private software entities. We\u2019ve seen this already as banks pour money into blockchain startups whose software isn\u2019t in the public domain. A more open and crowdsourced approach to address the business challenges in mass blockchain adoption is the better long-term option for leveraging the tremendous potential of blockchain technology.", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 22}

Fintech entrepreneur Wences Casares joined the board on Tuesday, PayPal announced Wednesday. The move has been interpreted as the beginning of a new phase in PayPal\u2019s timid love story with Bitcoin, which could conceivably culminate in open adoption.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve entered a period of unprecedented disruption in payments and financial services driven by the mass adoption of mobile technology and the digitization of cash,\u201d said PayPal President and CEO Dan Schulman. \u201cWences\u2019 long and successful track record as an international fintech entrepreneur with a focus on next-generation payment and cryptocurrency is a perfect fit for PayPal at this time. His unique line of sight into the future of commerce is ideally aligned with PayPal\u2019s vision of transforming the management and movement of money for people around the globe.\u201d\nThe fact that cryptocurrency and the transformation of money transfer are explicitly mentioned together in PayPal\u2019s official announcement is a telling sign. According to CNN Money , the appointment of Casares to the PayPal board of directors is yet another vote of confidence in Bitcoin\u2019s technology. PayPal, the leading company in Internet-based payments, had already shown interest in Bitcoin payments and the distributed blockchain technology that powers the Bitcoin network, and taken the first cautious steps toward integrating blockchain technology in its operations.\nOne of the clearest indications of PayPal\u2019s interest in Bitcoin is Paypal\u2019s subsidiary Braintree. The company, which was acquired by eBay (the former parent company of PayPal) for $800 million in September 2013 and became part of PayPal after the split, permits merchants to accept Bitcoin payments seamlessly in partnership with Coinbase. The Braintree Bitcoin payment service is currently in public beta. \n\u201cNo doubt a financial technology visionary, Casares has become best known for pioneering Bitcoin in recent times and that\u2019s exactly why PayPal has added him to its board,\u201d notes TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to see PayPal, the daddy of online payments and a true disruptor when it started out, open itself up to these new possibilities.\u201d Casares is well positioned to help PayPal in identifying and acquiring promising Bitcoin companies and unlocking new blockchain-based opportunities for its business worldwide.\n\u201cI am honored to serve on the board of an iconic global company dedicated to driving the transformation of money on a global scale,\u201d said Casares. \u201cI look forward to working together with the PayPal board and leadership team to continue to deliver their compelling vision.\u201d\nCasares is the CEO of Xapo, a Swiss company that offers Bitcoin digital wallets and debit cards. Xapo, which has raised $40 million to date, announced in May that it was relocating its corporate headquarters to Zurich, Switzerland, to take advantage of the country\u2019s strong privacy and banking secrecy. Xapo\u2019s primary deep cold storage vault is also located in Switzerland, with additional secure sites deployed around the globe.\nThe company takes aggressive initiatives to promote Bitcoin payments worldwide. For example, in April Xapo partnered with social network Taringa!, the second-most-popular social network after Facebook and one of the main destinations in the Latin American Web, to compensate its content-providing members in bitcoins, offering a service that could boost Bitcoin adoption in the region.\nMembers of the Bitcoin community have wondered if this is just the first of ambitious and aggressive initiatives by PayPal. For example, PayPal could integrate Xapo in its own operations, to complement Braintree\u2019s merchant-facing infrastructure with appropriate consumer-facing services. Another possibility is that Xapo could be acquired and become a PayPal company.\nPhoto Geoff Livingston / Flickr(CC)\n\n", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 25}

The more liberal-minded are called techlibs, who are mostly economists who favor allowing Bitcoin into the Russian market. Conservative figures in law enforcement are known as secruocrats, who are not fans of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, labeling them \u201cmoney surrogates,\u201d and are working to ban them. Each side has drafted laws either for or against Bitcoin usage in Russia. \nThe rumor mill of Bitcoin regulation has been churning for the better part of the last 18 months. A pro-Bitcoin draft of law will be under review by the Duma, the Russian parliament, where it is due for an official \u201creading\u201d as early as next month.\nMeanwhile the anti-Bitcoin securocrats are readying their draft for submission soon, according to Russian Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov.\n\u201cWe will continue protecting the consumers of financial services,\u201d Siluanov said. \u201cWe\u2019re developing penalties for distribution of money surrogates, including bitcoins, and for the establishment of Ponzi schemes. We will prepare the draft laws and submit them to the State Duma.\u201d\nRussia has a very different take on new currencies than the West does, considering the fact that they do not have a global reserve currency status behind them. In fact, the Russian economy is shaky at best, heavily reliant on oil exports, and, with oil prices tanking recently, the country does not need something new that may further devalue the Russian ruble.\nLike Bitcoin in 2014, Russia\u2019s native currency also lost close to 50 percent of its value due to economic sanctions from the West and changes in the price of oil. The ruble has dropped again to an all-time low due to the recent drop in the price of oil worldwide. So this may not be the best time to bring in a new currency that the government does not control.\n\u201cIt would be better to suppress distribution of money surrogates at early stages of the market\u2019s development,\u201d Siluanov said in an interview with the Russian government publication Rossiyskaya Gazeta. \u201cAccording to experts, the turnover amount of money surrogates in Russia has reached 1 percent of GDP. Once the parameter exceeds 10 percent, the tool will pose a real threat to the state\u2019s financial stability. Uncontrolled expansion of money supply in the turnover at the expense of the surrogates will result in devaluation, and gradual supersedure of the ruble from the currency market. Eventually, the state could lose its money issuance monopoly and revenue from this kind of activity.\u201d\nLike many nations and corporations worldwide, Russia seems to be in greater solidarity when it comes to Bitcoin\u2019s underlying blockchain technology. Its advantages over currency systems appear to have interested Russian government agencies, as well. The ministry\u2019s press center stated as much in a release to Forklog, which included another shot at Bitcoin entering the established economy:\n\u201cWe see the convenience and usefulness of the blockchain technology for e-commerce, so we think the technology shall have permission to develop,\u201d said Siluanov. \u201cHowever, bitcoins, as they are, and especially their inclusion in the real economy and real banking sector, may be extremely hazardous.\u201d\nA weak ruble may have Russia looking at Bitcoin somewhat differently than other major nations. This fact may make Bitcoin even more attractive to Russian citizens looking to protect their wealth by investing in an appreciating global asset.\nCan Russia stop its citizens from sharing Bitcoin on their smartphones, or forming a black market for digital currencies in general? According to Local Bitcoins, Russians are transacting about 83 million rubles or just over $1 million USD per week using its peer-to-peer exchange. Bitcoin is a hotly contested topic in a region that seems interested in resolving this issue quickly.\nEvander Smart is a bitcoin writer, enthusiast and business owner.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe long-lasting block-size dispute has catapulted into the center of attention again. One of the most talked about developments right now is Segregated Witness, of which a public testnet iteration was launched last week. The innovation as recently proposed by Blockstream co-founder and Bitcoin Core developer Dr. Pieter Wuille is a centerpiece of a scalability \u201croadmap\u201d set out by Bitcoin Core.\nBut relying on Segregated Witness as the next step of Bitcoin\u2019s scalability process is contended by recently launched Bitcoin Core fork Bitcoin Classic. Rather than a Segregated Witness soft fork, Bitcoin Classic prefers to deploy a \u201ccleaner\u201d hard fork in order to increase the block-size limit to 2 megabytes.\nTo find out where the development community stands on this issue, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to library and wallet developers, those who will need to do the heavy lifting needed to utilize Segregated Witness once rolled out.\nIn part 1: Blocktrail CTO and BitcoinJS co-maintainer Ruben de Vries.\nSegregated Witness\nWuille\u2019s Segregated Witness proposal offers several improvements to the Bitcoin network. The benefit that probably received most attention is its potential to effectively increase the block size to some 1.75 megabytes to 2 megabytes. Interestingly, however, many developers are more excited about the other improvements Segregated Witness has to offer, which they believe makes it well worth the effort.\nDe Vries, too, emphasized that Segregated Witness offers more than just added block space:\n\u201cEven if we wouldn\u2019t use the deployment of Segregated Witness to increase the block size in a nifty way, it fixes various issues that would benefit Bitcoin tremendously, and should be deployed as soon as possible, regardless. Being able to increase the block size as a side effect presents us with a chance we should clearly embrace, especially considering that it can be done on almost the same timeline as alternative block-size increase proposals.\u201d\nOne of the main arguments against Segregated Witness, is that it presents an \u201cugly\u201d workaround of existing code. This would lay an added burden on library and wallet developers, as they would need to re-write their code to utilize the innovation.\nDe Vries believes this effort is manageable, however. Most of the work needs to be done by library maintainers, a group of developers who essentially provide a standard for all wallets using a specific programming language. All other wallet developers using that programming language merely need to add some minor details.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not very complicated if you already know the ins and outs of the Bitcoin protocol, which a library maintainer will,\u201d De Vries said. \u201cTo grasp the concept when you don\u2019t is a bit harder. But then again, if you don\u2019t know the ins and outs of the Bitcoin protocol, there\u2019s no real reason for you to know the details of Segregated Witness in the first place.\u201d\nDe Vries himself has been developing for the Segregated Witness testnet for several weeks now, and the cross-platform Blocktrail wallet will support Segregated Witness transactions as soon as it is rolled out on the Bitcoin network.\n\u201cI started experimenting with the Segregated Witness testnet even before it entered the public phase, in order to start working on support for a bunch of libraries I contribute to a lot,\u201d De Vries said. \u201cGetting as many libraries to support Segregated Witness as soon as possible will help a lot with adoption, and, as a result, will make it so that we can get the increased block-size effect of Segregated Witness as soon as possible.\u201d\nOn Soft Forks and Hard Forks\nPerhaps the most notable difference between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Classic is that the former prefers a soft fork increase through Segregated Witness. This can be employed through miner-support only, and is, therefore, considered a safer solution by Bitcoin Core developers. The Bitcoin Classic team, however, believes these risks are overblown, and considers a hard fork more desirable.\nFor De Vries, the solution is clear-cut, however. He believes a soft fork through Segregated Witness is the best way forward for now.\n\u201cConsidering how much the Bitcoin Core development team has done for us in the past year, I feel that pushing them aside by forking is an insult to their expertise: They consider a hard fork too dangerous right now,\u201d De Vries said. \u201cMoreover, it could result in them losing their motivation or even quitting. It\u2019s simple, really. Segregated Witness fixes various issues that should have been in Bitcoin from the start, and, as a side effect, we can avoid a hard fork for now, which is great.\u201d\nFor more information on Segregated Witness, see Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s three-part series on the subject.", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 25}

Back is known as the inventor of Hashcash, the proof-of-work system used by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as part of the mining algorithm, one of the authors of the Bitcoin Sidechains white paper \u201cEnabling Blockchain Innovations with Pegged Sidechains\u201d and one of the founders of Blockstream. In the September podcast, he mentioned Zerocash, a recent development in cryptography that could be applied to new privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies.\nThe Zerocash protocol has been considered one of the most promising technologies for putting privacy back into the Bitcoin equation. Now, the Zerocash project has announced that the protocol is being developed into a full-fledged digital currency, Zcash.\n\nAccording to the recently launched website, Zcash is \u201ca decentralized and open-source cryptocurrency that aims to set a new standard for privacy and anonymity through the use of groundbreaking cryptography.\u201d \nA public alpha technology preview has been released on Github.\n\nZcash offers total payment confidentiality, while maintaining a decentralized network using a public blockchain. Unlike Bitcoin, Zcash transactions automatically hide the sender, recipient and value of all transactions on the blockchain. Only those with the correct view key can see the contents. Users have complete control and can opt-in to provide others with their view key at their discretion.\nTo achieve the (previously) impossible dream, Zcash uses a zero-knowledge proof construction called a zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARK), described in the Zerocash technicalpaper, first presented at the 2014 IEEE Security & Privacy Symposium. zk-SNARKs allow the Zcash network to maintain a secure ledger of balances without disclosing the parties or amounts involved. Instead of publicly demonstrating spend-authority and transaction values, the transaction metadata is encrypted and zk-SNARKs are used to prove that nobody is cheating or stealing.\nThe Zcash alpha code, a fork of Bitcoin Core with protocol changes to support the Zerocash protocol, provides a first preview implementation of the new Zcash cryptocurrency. The currency maintains a separate ledger from the Bitcoin network for several reasons, the most immediate of which is that the consensus protocol is different.\nCurrently, Zcash works only on Linux.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re releasing today is a working \u2018Technology Preview,\u2019\u201d says Zooko Wilcox in the first Zcash blog post. \u201cDevelopers can download the source code, compile it and connect to our live testnet. You can mine play-money \u201ctestnet-bux\u201d and spend them with a fully private, cryptographically protected transaction.\u201d \nIt\u2019s only testnet play-money at this time: Wilcox notes that Zcash probably won\u2019t be ready for real transactions for another six months.\nUpcoming blog posts will explain different parts of the system, including how Zcash works and its funding model, but in the first blog post Wilcox wants to address the most important question: Why?\nAccording to Wilcox, a 41-year-old cryptographer who\u2019s also known in the crypto community for creating Tahoe LAFS, a decentralized, encrypted file-storage system, privacy is a human right, a social value, and it is necessary for businesses and commerce.\nWilcox\u2019 answer to the expected question \u2013 But won\u2019t bad guys use it? \u2013 is crystal clear: \u201cYes, but bad guys will use anything,\u201d he says. \u201cBad guys use cars, bad guys use the Internet, bad guys use cash, and bad guys use the current banking system. Rather than trying to invent something that bad guys won\u2019t use, our purpose is to invent something that can empower and uplift the billions of good people on this planet.\u201d\nMore information on Zcash is being released in bits and snippets, and the public Zcash Forum is a good place to start. The Next Web notes that Zcash is a for-profit company that aims to \u201ctax\u201d mined Zcash coins at a rate of 11 percent. Ten percent will go to fund the company and pay back its early investors, while one percent will go to a not-for-profit created to oversee the code and the community. Wired reveals that Zcash investors including Naval Ravikant, an investor in Twitter and Uber, Barry Silbert and Roger Ver, have put more than $715,000 into Zcash.\nIf all goes according to plan, in six months or one year Zcash could be a fully operational, privacy-preserving alternative to Bitcoin. It\u2019s worth noting that Bitcoin itself is on its way to becoming mainstream fintech, controlled by governments and banks, with all privacy aspects sanitized away. Therefore, it\u2019s to be expected that Zcash, as soon as it\u2019s operational and stable, could be instantly adopted by the libertarian crowd of early Bitcoin users, and it will be interesting to see how governments and banks react.", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 26}

That was a mixture that was very carefully designed for a reason, and that reason is to ensure the greatest chances of adoption, to ensure the ability of Digital Asset [Holdings] to work with its various investors, and for the work that we do to benefit multiple investors simultaneously.\u201d\nIn other words, the investors in this fundraising round were chosen because they offer Digital Asset Holdings (DAH) the ability to build out many different use cases of their technology. During the interview with Bloomberg, Masters also noted additional investors could be added to this round in the next week or so.\nWhen asked about Bitcoin\u2019s ultimate promise of removing many of the middlemen found on Wall Street, Masters was quick to point out that her company is more interested in generalized blockchain technology than Bitcoin\u2019s open, permissionless network. \nShe explained:\n\u201cThere\u2019s a distinction between the ultimate promise of Bitcoin as a opposed to the potential application of the technology that was invented for the creation of Bitcoin \u2013 hence the blockchain technology. If you think about blockchain technology in layman\u2019s terms, which makes it a lot easier to understand, really you can think of it as a form of database technology because people know what a database is and know it\u2019s used to store important information you need to refer back to, basically.\u201d\nThe use of permissioned, distributed ledgers instead of Bitcoin has been a major theme in the industry over the past year, with startups, such as DAH and R3, attempting to bring better security and more efficient settlement to financial institutions around the world. Having said that, the likes of Digital Currency Group Founder Barry Silbert, Xapo CEO Wences Casares, and other Bitcoin icons still believe the banking industry will eventually abandon these permissioned blockchains and find their way back to the Bitcoin blockchain.\nWhat Benefits Can DAH Offer Financial Institutions?\nWhen it comes to the specific advantages of distributed ledgers for financial institutions, Masters mainly focused on three key areas: security, settlement, and data replication. She discussed the power of a shared, distributed ledger during her interview with Bloomberg:\n\u201cYou can think of a blockchain or distributed ledger as a shared, replicated source of the same information that stays the same at all points in time and uses sophisticated technology to ensure that it\u2019s not possible to hack into or falsify that record. More importantly, once information is submitted to that ledger or record, it can never be edited.\u201d\nOne possible use case mentioned by Masters during the interview could affect the average person on the street. She said individuals who sell assets on an exchange will be able to have access to those funds from that sale on the same day if this technology is widely implemented.\nMasters also mentioned cost avoidance, capital reduction, risk reduction and regulatory compliance as the main reasons DAH\u2019s investors are interested in distributed ledger technology.\nAustralian Stock Exchange Embraces Blockchain Technology\nIt appears that Australia\u2019s stock market may be the first major test for the use of blockchain technology by a traditional stock exchange. ASX\u2019s infrastructure was scheduled for an update of its core technology, and DAH was able to win a deal as its provider of choice. Masters\u2019 startup is said to have beat out some 400 other technology companies for the opportunity to re-engineer how the Australian market operates.\nDuring her interview with Bloomberg, Masters pointed out two reasons why Australia makes sense as a test ground for this technology:\n\u201cThe Australian market has some unique features to it. First of all, it\u2019s a fully dematerialized market. What that means is that they moved away some time ago from the notion of stocks having to have physical certificates that have to reside somewhere, so it\u2019s a market which inherently involves electronic or digital records of ownership of securities. Second of all, ASX operates a central securities record-keeping or ledger-keeping service and is responsible for the totality of the settlement and clearing process.\u201d\nASX is one of the top 15 equity markets in the world. Although Bitcoin\u2019s mainstream moment has yet to come, it\u2019s clear that blockchain technology is about to take center stage.\nPhoto Cimexus / Flickr(CC)", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 22}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nAlthough bitcoin is often touted as a global currency, the reality is that some countries may find it more useful than others. While moving toward more generalized blockchain technology is the trend in the developed world, there are still plenty of people in certain parts of the world who don\u2019t have much interest in permissioned ledgers.\n\nBitso CEO Pablo Gonzalez was recently interviewed on Trace Mayer\u2019s Bitcoin Knowledge Podcast, and one of the main topics of conversation was why Gonzalez decided to build a Bitcoin exchange in Mexico. Mayer clearly understands Bitcoin\u2019s potential in Latin America, as he noted the following near the beginning of the interview:\n\u201cBitPay\u2019s transaction volumes are growing everywhere. They\u2019re growing in North America; they\u2019re growing in Europe; they\u2019re growing in Asia; but far and away, Latin America is where the big growth is coming with BitPay.\u201d\nDuring their conversation, Gonzalez was able to explain why this phenomenon exists, at least from a Mexican perspective.\nLatin America Is Waking Up to Bitcoin\n\nBefore getting into the specifics of why Bitcoin makes sense for Mexico, Gonzalez briefly touched on Latin America as a whole. At first, he talked about the general lack of Bitcoin adoption in the region, with the notable exception of Argentina:\n\u201cOther than Argentina, where there\u2019s a vibrant community and there\u2019s been a vibrant community for a few years, in Latin America the community was very small. At the beginning, the volumes were small and the growth was slow. For the past year, Latin America has been waking up to this technology.\u201d\nAlthough the developed world is used to having relatively stable currencies and mature financial systems, that is not the case in much of Latin America. \n\u201cThere are so many holes to fix with this technology, and that\u2019s driving a lot of the growth,\u201d Gonzalez noted.\nMexico\u2019s Demographic Is Perfect for Bitcoin\n\nMoving on to why Bitcoin makes sense for Mexico, Gonzalez first focused on the demographics of the country. He explained that Mexicans do not use bank accounts or credit cards anywhere near as frequently as their American counterparts across the border:\n\u201cIn a place like Mexico you have a very low population that\u2019s banked \u2013 seven out of ten Mexicans do not have a bank account and only twelve percent of the population has credit cards. So most of the economy is a cash economy.\u201d\nAlthough banking and credit cards are not prevalent in Mexico, cell phones are everywhere. \n\u201cIn Mexico, you have extremely high cell phone adoption. Almost every Mexican now has a cell phone,\u201d Gonzalez noted. \u201cSmartphones are growing even faster than in the U.S.\u201d\nXapo CEO Wences Casares has discussed the issues with cash-based economies in the past, and the fact that Mexico has such massive adoption of mobile phones and smartphones means the infrastructure is there for Bitcoin to succeed.\nMexicans Don\u2019t Trust Banks or the Government\n\nThe factors behind Mexico\u2019s low adoption of bank accounts do not necessarily include a lack of access to traditional financial systems. Gonzalez noted that there are trust issues in the region when it comes to banks and the government.\n\u201cThe thing is that people do not trust these institutions \u2013 to put their money in these institutions,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they feel like they\u2019re being watched. There\u2019s a cultural issue.\u201d\nAlthough Gonzalez noted that the Mexican peso has been one of the most stable currencies in the region in recent history, he did point out that the country has had issues with devaluations in the past. The Bitso CEO pointed out one specific case during the interview:\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple of times where the Mexican peso, in 1994 for example, went from three pesos per dollar to eleven. So we\u2019ve had a couple times where it\u2019s been really bad.\u201d\nAlthough some Mexicans are unbanked by choice, it is true that gaining access to a bank account or the global financial system can be difficult for many citizens. Gonzalez noted the issues for those Mexicans who do want to be banked:\n\u201cThere\u2019s also a location issue. If you look at all of the municipalities in Mexico, only half of them have a financial institution in them. Whether it\u2019s a bank or even a Western Union. Even if people want to be banked, they have to travel to these physical locations and get a bank account.\u201d\nThe popularity of Bitcoin in certain Latin American countries may have been overblown in the past, but it\u2019s clear that both Mayer and Gonzalez are still bullish on the peer-to-peer digital cash system\u2019s chances of widespread adoption in the region. Bitcoin has long been touted as a solution for the unbanked population around the world, but this promise of bringing large numbers of new users from developing countries to the blockchain has not yet come to fruition.\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe ongoing block size dispute has catapulted to the center of attention again. One of the most talked about developments right now is Segregated Witness, of which a public testnet iteration was launched last week. The innovation as recently proposed by Blockstream co-founder and Bitcoin Core developer Dr. Pieter Wuille is a centerpiece of a scalability \u201croadmap\u201d set out by Bitcoin Core.\nBut relying on Segregated Witness as the next step of Bitcoin\u2019s scalability process is opposed by the recently launched Bitcoin Core fork Bitcoin Classic. Rather than a Segregated Witness soft fork, Bitcoin Classic prefers to deploy a \u201ccleaner\u201d hard fork in order to increase the block size limit to 2 megabytes.\nTo find out where the development community stands on this issue, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to library and wallet developers, those who will need to do the heavy lifting in order to utilize Segregated Witness once rolled out.\nGreenAddress Implementing Segregated Witness\n\nSegregated Witness offers several improvements to the Bitcoin network. Among these improvements is an effective block size limit increase to a range between 1.75 and 2 megabytes, depending on the types of transactions. While this has received a lot of attention in context of the block size dispute, many developers are actually more excited about the other improvements to the Bitcoin protocol offered by the innovative solution.\nGreenAddress and GreenBits developer Lawrence Nahum is in the advanced stage of implementing Segregated Witness into GreenAddress.\n\u201cGreenAddress already implemented some basic support for it on the Segregated Witness testnet,\u201d Nahum said. \u201cWe started experimenting because we think Segregated Witnesses is a great enabler. It fixes the unintentional malleability issues, and thus allows for trustless smart contracts as well as lower fees for multi-signature transactions which we use extensively. It\u2019s really exciting.\u201d\nOne of the criticisms against Wuille\u2019s Segregated Witness proposal is that it would take a lot of work and time to roll out. Library developers, in particular, need to implement a decent amount of new code, which other wallet developers will be able to use.\nNahum, however, believes the added effort is manageable, and will have Segregated Witness enabled in his wallets once it is rolled out on the Bitcoin network.\n\u201cThe Segregated Witness testnet support was relatively easy to set up,\u201d Nahum said. \u201cIt only took a few hours of reading the technical details, and a day to implement. This includes both the wallet side running on the user device, as well as the service side. The former was aided by the fact that one of the wallet libraries we use, bitcoinjs, already had a Pull Request with the necessary patches enabling it. For the latter we wrote a patch for another library, PyCoin, to support our use cases. Not that big of a deal.\u201d\nSoft Forks vs. Hard Forks\n\nThe most notable difference between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Classic is that the former prefers a soft fork block size limit increase through Segregated Witness. This can be employed through miner-support only, and is therefore considered a safer solution by Bitcoin Core developers. The Bitcoin Classic team, however, believes these risks are overblown, and considers a hard fork more desirable.\nFor Nahum, a soft-fork solution is the obvious choice.\n\u201cSegregated Witness is worth the small effort as the changes are not much work, and it\u2019s a no-brainer compared to a contentious hard fork,\u201d he said. \u201dIt\u2019s really a win-win situation. A hard fork is not justified by the tremendous risks, especially in a compressed time frame as proposed. Bitcoin Classic\u2019s \u2018mob rule\u2019 approach is very different from the more meritocratic and technical peer review that we are accustomed to in Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin Classic doesn\u2019t seem to be competing on technical merits, but rather political. It feels like an attempt at a different, more central governance model. In my opinion this goes against the guiding principles that brought us to the present, and makes me uncomfortable.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cAs a business owner, an investor, a developer and a supporter of this technology, I want long-term stability and consensus, not short-term or knee-jerk reactions. The future of this space lies in innovation, and only calm minds and long-term vision will see us through it successfully.\u201d\nFor more information on Segregated Witness, see Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s three-part series on the subject, or part 1 of this development series.\n", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 26}

Because of the economic slump in the United States, the Southeast Asian region, and China, he predicts the demand for bitcoin to continue rising in the upcoming weeks.\n\u201cThe recent increase in trading volume cannot be traced to any single factor. Rather, there was a confluence of global factors that contributed to increased demand for bitcoin, including the recent slump in global stock and commodity prices,\u201d he explained.\nOne factor that could have possibly led to the explosive demand for bitcoin in China is the announcement of one of the biggest China stock market crash warnings, as the government stated economic growth in 2015 declined to 6.9 percent.\nPresident Xi Jinping officially requested officials to stabilize short-term growth, as the country\u2019s economic growth was the slowest recorded in 25 years.\n\u201cChina\u2019s reported growth rate for 2015 raises many questions rather than providing full reassurance about the economy\u2019s true growth momentum,\u201d Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University and the former head of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s China division said in an interview.\n\nLegendary Swiss investor Marc Faber, who in the entirety of his career discussed the trending value of precious metals such as gold also expressed his optimism toward bitcoin in a recent interview.\n\u201cWhen you talk about doom and gloom for this year, 2016, I have to point out that in 2015, with the exception of people that held bitcoins, the performance of all asset classes has been poor,\u201d said Faber.\n\nWhile it is difficult to speculate the trend of bitcoin price and trading volumes in China, Bitcoin experts and exchanges are optimistic about the rising demand for bitcoin and expect a constant increase in trading volume over the next few months.

PBOC, China\u2019s central bank, is persuaded that a state-backed digital currency could reduce capital outflow, money laundering and tax evasion, make economic activity more transparent and improve the efficiency of global transactions.\nThe creation of China\u2019s state digital currency was discussed at a meeting in Beijing, attended by digital fintech experts and high level authorities including PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan and Deputy Governor Chair Fan Yifei. The PBOC\u2019s official statement is in Chinese only, but Chinese speakers have confirmed that the automatic translation provided by Google is reasonably accurate and understandable. \nA research team including experts from Citigroup and Deloitte has been looking into digital currencies since 2014 and has achieved some encouraging initial results. This team is now expected to \u201cset up clear strategic objectives for digital currencies issued by the central bank, and develop key technologies and applications aimed at an early launch of a digital currency issued by the central bank.\u201d\nHao Hong, chief China strategist at the Bank of Communications, said China\u2019s attitude toward digital currency had been shifting, South China Morning Post reports. In 2013, the central government issued negative statements on Bitcoin and limited its use by banks and payment service providers, but now it seems that the wind is changing.\n\u201cThe attitude toward digital currency in China has been shifting, it has been surprising,\u201d said Hong. \u201cBack then it was quite hostile. Now, facing capital outflow pressure, a digital currency would make it easier to check the capital flow.\u201d\nAn estimated $843 billion of capital flowed out of China in the 11 months through November, according to a Bloomberg estimate, and capital outflow results in rising interest rates and economic slowdown. Foreign transactions in a digital currency based on blockchain technology would be permanently recorded in a tamper-proof blockchain and traceable back to the persons involved. However, it seems likely that, if the Chinese government introduces an official \u201cChinaCoin,\u201d wealthy Chinese will just use other means to take capital out of the country, including next-generation privacy-preserving digital currencies like Zcash .\n\nAccording to the South China Morning Post article, a digital currency could be popular with Chinese consumers, as payments for goods and services are increasingly becoming digital with new applications and online players entering the potentially lucrative sector.\n\u201c[A cryptocurrency] can be popular among the people [if] it\u2019s endorsed by the government and convenient to use with new technologies,\u201d said Zhang Weichao, director of mining at leading Chinese Bitcoin operator Huobi.\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s too early to see what effect PBOC\u2019s move will have on China\u2019s Bitcoin community,\u201d said Wang Chun, co-founder of the mining pool F2Pool. \u201cThey could decide to let Bitcoin co-exist with its own digital currency, or chose to crack down on it.\u201d\nBesides being useful as a means to control capital outflow, a state cryptocurrency would also allow China to challenge the hegemony of the U.S. dollar. \n\u201cThe U.S. dollar has the luxury of pricing everything, every commodity, in U.S. dollars,\u201d said Hong. \u201cThat is why it can maintain a power grip on the global economy.\u201d China\u2019s efforts in this direction have made little progress so far, and a state-backed digital currency could help. However, Hong cautioned that would take time.\nEcuador became the first nation in the world to issue a government-backed digital currency last year, telling all of the country\u2019s banks to get on board. There have been rumors of \u201cFedcoin\u201d in the United States and some kind of \u201cEurocoin\u201d in Europe. Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister, proposed a cryptocurrency dubbed Future Tax Coin (FT-Coin). Other countries including the Philippines are studying the possibility of rolling out official digital currencies. According to some Chinese economists, digital money is the future, and China should take the lead.\n\u201cChina must seize the first-mover advantage to get on board,\u201d said Hu Zhibing, the chief operating officer at Haoyouqian, a crowd-funding startup in Beijing. \u201cThe central bank would be blamed by the whole nation if other countries moved ahead while China lagged behind.\u201d\nIf Chinese authorities choose to push ahead and proceed with the creation and deployment of ChinaCoin, it seems plausible that the impact could be quite disruptive.", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 28}

While making changes to Bitcoin Core may seem trivial to some, the politics associated with certain proposals have caused major issues for the development process.\nBitcoin Developer and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo gave a talk that mainly focused on potential options for scaling Bitcoin at the Blockchain Agenda Conference in San Diego, and he dedicated a portion of his presentation to the current issues surrounding possible changes to Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules. Lombrozo covered soft forks, hard forks and a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that could eventually make it easier to deploy soft forks on the network.\nProblems with Changing Bitcoin\u2019s Consensus Rules\n\nBefore getting into possible solutions, Lombrozo first discussed the current issues with coming to consensus on new rules for the Bitcoin network. Although Bitcoin\u2019s decentralization is what makes the network valuable to its users, the lack of a central decider who can dictate the rules of the network has been an issue. Lombrozo explained:\n\u201cWhenever we want to change the consensus rules, this presents a serious problem because we don\u2019t really want to just force new rules on the network. There\u2019s no central authority that can do this really. We need to have a way for the network to adapt to the new rules, decide whether or not it wants to adjust to these rules, and to make sure that everyone still ends up agreeing in the end.\u201d\nSome have stated a benevolent dictator is needed for Bitcoin, and former Bitcoin Developer Mike Hearn intended to take on that role for the alternative implementation of the Bitcoin protocol known as Bitcoin XT. While Bitcoin software clients are able to have benevolent dictators behind the code, the ability for users to choose which code to run on their own computers makes the idea of a benevolent dictator of the Bitcoin protocol an impractical notion.\nHard Forks and Soft Forks\n\nLombrozo next talked about hard forks and soft forks. These forks take place whenever the rules of the network are changed, and they\u2019re currently the only option for updating the protocol.\nLombrozo: \u201cSoft forks happen when blocks that used to be valid become invalid according to the new rules. And with these kinds of forks, if a majority of miners agree that the new rules are going to be in effect, then that particular chain is going to outgrow the other one and it will become the main chain.\u201d\nLombrozo said that the hard fork process is a much more difficult proposition.\n\u201cIn the case of hard forks, this is not the case. We have invalid blocks that become valid under the new rules, and this creates a network fork that can go on forever. So this is a much, much more difficult situation for us to fix.\u201d\nBitcoin has not experienced any intentional hard forks since the earliest days of its existence. There is currently a large portion of the community that would like to see a hard fork take place in order to increase the block size limit. Bitcoin Classic is an upcoming software release that implements this change.\nBIP 9: Version Bits with Timeout and Delay\n\nOne of the ways Lombrozo believes changes to Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules can be made easier is by implementing BIP 9. The proposal intends to make soft fork deployment an easier process by allowing multiple forks to be deployed at the same time. This is achieved through changes to how the \u201cversion\u201d field in blocks is interpreted by nodes on the network.\nLombrozo described BIP 9 during his presentation at Blockchain Agenda San Diego:\n\u201cOne thing that I\u2019ve been working on recently is a thing called version bits, BIP 9, which is a mechanism to allow for simpler soft fork deployments. This allows miners to signal when they\u2019re ready to enforce the new rules, and it allows you to set up a parallel soft fork. So now, several features are being deployed at the same time without necessarily knowing which one is going to be activated first. It provides a warning system, so old nodes can upgrade when they see new rules are going to be [activated].\u201d\nAlthough soft forks may be easier to deploy in the near future, Lombrozo added, \u201cHard forks are still hard.\u201d\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

The thing I think is most interesting about SegWit soft-fork technique is the ability to add new signature types such as Schnorr signatures. This means that if elliptic curve algorithms were broken, for instance by quantum computers in the future, we could fix that with only a soft fork, by adding a new quantum resistant digital signature algorithm. The fact that we get a quick, effective bump in block space is just a bonus.\u201d\nAs such, Voisine plans to roll out support for Segregated Witness on the popular Bitcoin wallet app for iOS.\n\u201cThe implementation is not especially difficult, and it\u2019s opt-in for wallet developers,\u201d Voisine explained. \u201cExisting wallets that don\u2019t upgrade will continue to work, they will just need to pay higher fees because their transactions will be larger than Segregated Witness transactions.

The Bitcoin Classic team, however, believes these risks are overblown, and considers a hard fork more desirable.\nVoisine said he sees merit in a soft fork as well \u2013 though he notably expressed support for Bitcoin Classic, too.\n\u201cI think we should do the Segregated Witness soft fork first,\u201d Voisine said. \u201cIt will be quicker to achieve consensus. However, Segregated Witness will only give us something like an 80 percent capacity increase, and hard forks take a long time to deploy. The hard fork needs to be readied, and roll-out started quickly after. While I\u2019d prefer it if Bitcoin Core does that, it appears Bitcoin Classic is the leading option for deploying a hard fork. As such, we do support that project.\u201d\nFor more information on Segregated Witness, see Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s three-part series on the subject, or part 1 and part 2 of this development series.", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 27}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nEveryone from Nick Szabo, who developed the concept of smart contracts, to Blockchain Capital Managing Partner Brock Pierce has been touting Bitcoin\u2019s value as a vehicle for international money transfers lately, but it appears that TransferWise CEO Taavet Hinrikus has not received the memo. Hinrikus was recently on a panel with MasterCard President of International Markets Ann Cairns at the World Economic Forum in Davos, and he did not seem threatened when asked about the new Bitcoin-based alternatives to his service, such as Align Commerce, that have popped up over the past year.\nAlthough Hinrikus appeared to be bullish on blockchain technology, he said the Bitcoin experiment is nearly over.\nBitcoin Is \u201cBecoming Dead\u201d\n\nWhen asked directly for his thoughts on using Bitcoin for international money transfers, Hinrikus conceded that the idea sounds exciting in theory; however, the TransferWise CEO believes this digital peer-to-peer cash system will work only if more people have bitcoin wallets. He explained:\n\u201cI think [Bitcoin-powered money transfers] are super exciting, and in a world where we all have a bitcoin wallet in our phones, that actually might work. But how do we go from a world where nobody has a bitcoin wallet to a world where everyone has a bitcoin wallet? That\u2019s the question that I haven\u2019t been able to figure out.\u201d\nWhen viewing Bitcoin as a system for money transfers, Hinrikus noted the costs associated with each end of the process. In his view, these added costs make the idea more expensive than originally thought. He stated:\n\u201cIf you think about it today, getting money into Bitcoin is a pain in the ass. Getting money out of Bitcoin is similarly a huge pain. You end up paying typically half a percent or one percent on both ends. It\u2019s a process which takes multiple days, so I think Bitcoin \u2013 I\u2019m kind of sorry to say it but \u2013 it seems that experiment is becoming dead pretty quickly.\u201d\nThis response from the TransferWise CEO does not sound dissimilar from a Medium post made by former Rebit.ph Head of Product Luis Buenaventura. After co-founding and working at Rebit.ph for over a year, Buenaventura came to the conclusion that Bitcoin does not make international remittances cheaper due to the costs associated with the \u201clast mile\u201d on the recipient\u2019s end.\nBlockchain Is More Exciting\n\nHinrikus also echoed some of the same points he made when asked about Bitcoin at last year\u2019s TechCrunch Disrupt. Specifically, he feels the growth of Bitcoin has been mostly driven by greed. He stated:\n\u201cIt seems to me that what has been driving Bitcoin has been greed \u2013 similar to a lot of stuff that has been driving the banking system. People bought bitcoin because they thought it was going to be worth more tomorrow \u2026 I kind of don\u2019t have much hope for bitcoin anymore. With blockchain, I think that\u2019s much more exciting. I think about \u2013 could we see a world where blockchain disrupts MasterCard?\u201d\nAlthough Hinrikus noted his appreciation for blockchain technology, he made no indication that his company is currently looking at implementing (or even testing) any sort of distributed ledger technology. On the other hand, MasterCard\u2019s Cairns said that the credit card processing giant is currently testing out blockchains for a variety of possible use cases.\nBitFury CEO Defends Bitcoin\n\nThe day after the panel discussion featuring Hinrikus and Cairns took place, BitFury CEO Valery Vavilov was interviewed in the same exact spot. He took on the role of defending Bitcoin against the pessimism from the TransferWise and MasterCard representatives.\nDuring his interview with TechCrunch\u2019s Matt Burns, Vavilov explained why the public Bitcoin blockchain still has a key role to play in this new world of permissioned, distributed ledgers:\n\u201cBitcoin is the most secure blockchain. The Bitcoin blockchain is the public blockchain. If we split Bitcoin and blockchain \u2013 blockchain is the ledger. Blockchain is the database. Bitcoin is the vehicle and the security. Bitcoin is today secured by 750 petahashes of computational power. Let\u2019s look at an analogy. Imagine the top 500 supercomputers in the world. The Bitcoin blockchain security is more than 3,000 times bigger.\u201d\nIn other words, Bitcoin\u2019s open, permissionless features are not found on any of the private blockchains currently in development by R3, Digital Asset Holdings, or any other startup. Bitcoin is also backed by an exponentially larger amount of hashing power than any other public blockchain.\nThe only requirement for someone to receive bitcoin is for them to have a bitcoin wallet and access to the Internet. This is a much lower barrier to entry than anything attached to the legacy banking system \u2013 at least when it comes to digital payments. Bitcoin\u2019s censorship resistance also makes it useful for getting around capital controls in more economically-restrictive countries.\nTransferWise may not see the value of Bitcoin now, but at least three Bitcoin startups (Align Commerce, Abra, and Freemit) believe they\u2019re missing out on a huge opportunity. Only time will tell who has it right.\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

This is after a two-week period where the Ethereum market cap has grown by more than 80 percent.\nThe price of Ethereum is on an equally steep upward trend, growing more than 300 percent since the beginning of January; 24-hour volume has grown from around $300,000 to upwards of $10 million. This is in comparison to the average daily Litecoin trading volume of $1 million and is up to a quarter of the daily trading volume of Bitcoin, which is $39.5 million. It looks like the market cap of Ethereum, which is $280M will soon rocket past the market cap of Ripple, which is $300M and the second-largest market cap for a digital currency, because of Ripple\u2019s lower average daily trading volume of $3 million.\nThe announcement by Mike Hearn, who recently joined the development team for R3 CEV, that \u201cthe bitcoin experiment has failed,\u201d may have been a factor in the demand for alternative digital currencies like Ethereum. R3 also announced that it completed a distributed ledger that connects 11 of the world\u2019s premier banks in a private peer-to-peer blockchain using Ethereum technology and hosted by Microsoft Azure on a virtual private network.\n\u201cEthereum is a well-known open source technology in this space,\u201d Brad Novak, chief technology officer for R3 consortium-member Barclays Investment Bank, commented.\nIn addition, the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s William Mougayar says, \u201cThere are probably a dozen banks doing stuff on Ethereum already without even being part of a consortium. You have to pay money to be part of it [R3], and it\u2019s still at the blueprint architectural stage.\u201d\nEthereum is in a unique position for a digital currency. It is an application layer, where developers can create decentralized applications such as smart contracts using the Ethereum APIs, available for free at GitHub. Ether, which is Ethereum\u2019s digital token, powers the network and is analogous to \u201cgas\u201d that powers the Dapps (Decentralized Apps).\nEthereum eliminates the block size problem that is plaguing the Bitcoin community today, as Ethereum blocks are able to change in size based on the volume of transactions that need to be processed.\nSince it was announced last year by Vitalik Buterin, there has been an increasing interest from developers who are testing the Ethereum technology. For example, Augur is a decentralized prediction market built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, where users can get \u201cprecise forecasts on any topic \u2013 from politics to commerce, from technology to entertainment,\u201d according to the Augur website.\nMany of the applications that are being developed on Ethereum are still in their early stages, either with betas released or still in their development phase. Anthony Di Iorio, one of the co-founders of the project and the head of the Toronto Ethereum Meetup group, tells Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cIt\u2019s great to see the community growing and more and more businesses realizing the potential of Ethereum and incorporating it into their prototypes.\u201d\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 28}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nUpdated on Jan. 22, 2016 at 11:50 EST:\nBitcoin Magazine recieved a response from major Chinese Bitcoin exchange Huobi, which indicated that the situation was still evolving. According to Huobi, there was not yet consensus among the Chinese mining community about whether to run Bitcoin Classic or Bitcoin Core. This contradicts the earlier information from F2Pool and HaoBTC indicating that a decision had been reached. \u201cWe all feel it's not appropriate for us to give comments at the moment because Evan Mo and other miners are still discussing this issue and haven't come to a consensus. We will continuously pay attention to this issue and make official comment on it when the time is right,\u201d said a Huobi spokesperson in an emailed statement to Bitcoin Magazine.\nOriginal article:\nShortly after the sensational public break-up between Bitcoin and R3CEV - hire Mike Hearn, and the launch of several alternative Bitcoin implementations, the block-size dispute is reaching fever pitch. Bitcoin Classic, in particular, has been gathering support among companies, users and some developers. Significantly, a number of mining pools has also publicly come out in support of the Bitcoin Core fork led by Jonathan Toomim.\nThe second largest mining pool on the Bitcoin network, with some 23 percent of hashing power, China-based F2Pool, was said to be among the pools prepared to switch to Bitcoin Classic. Yesterday, however, rumors started to surface claiming that the Chinese pools had changed position, and will stick with Bitcoin Core.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, F2Pool operator Wang Chun confirmed this is indeed the case.\n\u201cThe rumors are true,\u201d Chun said. \u201cMiners in China were scared by Luke Dashjr\u2019s proof-of-work changing pull request.\u201d\nThe specific pull request Chun refers to was made by Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin LJR developer Luke Dashjr last week. Dashjr argued that a hard fork should be accompanied by a change of Bitcoin mining hashing algorithm, as it would render ASIC miners obsolete and could re-decentralize mining. Since Bitcoin Classic intends to democratize governance of the implementation, users could vote on the pull request; it had not received widespread support as of yet.\nThe pull request itself, however, was quickly closed by Bitcoin Classic lead developer Jonathan Toomim, who considered the idea too radical. He argued it shouldn\u2019t have been submitted to GitHub directly \u2013 but rather discussed on the voting page and Reddit.\nMany Bitcoin Classic proponents believe that the pull request was a sabotage attempt against Bitcoin Classic. They reason that the proposal was specifically intended to strike fear into the hearts of the mining community; if the pull request were to be adopted, any investments made in mining hardware could quickly be made worthless.\nWhen Bitcoin Magazine spoke to Wang Chun earlier this week, the pool operator had already nuanced his position. F2Pool\u2019s claimed support for Bitcoin Classic was misinterpreted, said Chun, stating:\n\u201cWe did not say we would \u2018support\u2019 Bitcoin Classic. We used the word \u2018welcome,\u2019 to be exact.\u201d\nEarlier this week Chun did, however, emphasize that he wants the block size limit to be increased. Perhaps more important, Chun insists a hard fork is the desired solution to accomplish this \u2013 rather than a soft fork through Segregated Witness, as the Bitcoin Core development team intends.\n\u201cAt the Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Hong Kong, almost every one of us agreed that block size should be increased, and should be increased as a hard fork, as there was no soft fork solution back then,\u201d Chun explained. \u201cThen, last minute, Segregated Witness was introduced. I admire Dr. Pieter Wuille\u2019s brilliant hack to deploy it as a soft fork. But despite being brilliant, the soft fork Segregated Witness is still a hack. A hack is dirty. Such a technology would be better implemented as hard fork.\u201d\nChun has made a concrete hard fork proposal since \u2013 though the details of this proposal are not yet clear.\nA hard fork solution is regarded as a measure of last resort by the Bitcoin Core development team. With hard forks, all full nodes on the Bitcoin network need to change their software to the latest version or risk being \u201cforked off\u201d the network, with potential unforeseen consequences. Soft forks, considered safer by most Bitcoin Core developers as they only require miners to change their software, have been rolled out several times.\nBut Chun, like the Bitcoin Classic development team, believes the Bitcoin network can grow more cleanly through a hard fork.\nChun:\n\u201cSince Segregated Witness will only allow for some 70 percent of added space, a 2-megabyte hard fork would allow for more headroom, which could end the debate for now. People will not only be more satisfied, they\u2019ll also see that we can actually get something done, get something fixed\u2026 not just find some detour hack to leave the issue to the next generation.\u201d\nWhile Chun earlier this week indicated that support for Bitcoin Classic in absence of a hard fork was not completely off the table, it seems that has now changed.\nAfter finishing this article, a second Chinese wallet service, HaoBTC, has confirmed\nto Bitcoin Magazine that Chinese pools will stick with Bitcoin Core, too.\n\nBitcoin Magazine will be closely monitoring this story as it progresses.\n", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 21}

Over the course of two days, teams of blockchain experts came together to create projects worthy of cash prizes.\nThe CargoChain team developed the winning idea, taking home the $30,000 grand prize.\n\u201cMy partner [John Freeman] and I created CargoChain, which digitalizes international trade with specific focus on the bill of lading,\u201d said Dominik Schiener, a member of the winning team. \u201cCargoChain places the bill of lading as an eternal record into the blockchain and provides a clear chain of custody. It additionally has an escrow system which gets rid of the inefficiencies of letter of credit. This makes it possible for mutually untrusted parties to conduct trade without worrying about the legitimacy of the other party.\u201d\n\nA second-place prize worth $20,000 also was awarded, as well as a third-place prize and special prizes worth $10,000 each, which went to other participating teams.\n\u201cCargoChain was well received at the Hackathon, and people from Deloitte and Wanxiang loved the idea,\u201d Schiener continued. \u201cThere is a clear demand to reduce costs and make international trade more efficient by finally getting rid of all the paperwork. Currently, I\u2019m assessing potential opportunities, but I think that it would be amazing to help reshape the backbone of our economy with a blockchain-based system that benefits all the actors involved in trade.\u201d\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t all about competition for the attendees of the Shanghai Blockchain Hackathon. The event also featured workshops and the opportunity for participants to speak with experts from Ethereum, Deloitte Rubix Team and Wanxiang Blockchain Labs. These individuals also were available for technical support throughout the hackathon.\u00a0\n\nThe goal of Shanghai Blockchain was to bring together blockchain enthusiasts, engineers and designers to think creatively about Bitcoin as a whole. Now that the event is over, the sponsors of the Shanghai Blockchain Hackathon are still working to promote their initial objective.\u00a0\nWanxiang Blockchain Labs recently announced the launch of BlockGrant X No. 2, which is a follow-up to its first sponsorship program, BlockGrant No. 1: Genesis. The first program gave a total of $100,000 to nine teams that created projects focusing on everything from random-number generation to decision-making. BlockGrant X No. 2 will have a budget of $40,000, and teams have until January 31 to submit their applications to participate. A global panel will convene to determine the winners based on their viability, significance and innovativeness.\u00a0\nAs Wanxiang Blockchain Labs and other organizations continue to promote Blockchain and all things Bitcoin, the future looks bright for the industry as a whole.\n\u201cI think that in the coming years, we will finally see a crystallization of clear use cases of the blockchain,\u201d says Schiener. \u201cIt will become clearer where and how exactly it makes sense to implement a blockchain to reshape certain processes. I am not a believer of \u2018one chain to rule them all,\u2019 which is why I think that once blockchains become interoperable, we will create new possibilities for organizations, startups and individuals to take the best of each blockchain and combine them in yet unimaginable applications.\u201d\nKrystle Vermes is a professional writer, blogger and podcaster with a background in both online and print journalism.", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 21}

Srinivasan, presented this exact world, one in which data is owned and monetized by the individual. He laid out an in-depth use case whereby Instagram could become the world\u2019s largest stock photography site \u2013 with each user making money.\n\nPersonal Data as an Asset Class\nIn 2011, the World Economic Forum, in collaboration with management consulting firm Bain & Company, published a report targeted at executives in the telecommunications industry titled, \u201cPersonal Data: The Emergence of a New Asset Class.\u201d In the report, they described \u201cpersonal data as the new oil of the Internet and the new currency of the digital world.\u201d\nTo substantiate their claim the authors present an estimate which states, \u201cby 2020 the global volume of digital data will increase more than 40-fold.\u201d They go on to say that, \u201cbeyond the sheer volume, data is becoming a new type of raw material that\u2019s on par with capital and labour.\u201d\nThe implications of data as an asset are profound. When data is currency, cash is expendable. Success is measured by growth, not profits:\n\u201cTwitter Finally Turns a Profit, but User Base Growth Is Slowing\u201d\n\n\u201cFacebook Turns a Profit, Users Hit 300 Million\u201d\n\n\u201cAmazon Never Makes Money but No One Cares\u201d\n\n\u201cYouTube: 1 Billion Viewers, No Profit\u201d\n\n\nIf data is the new currency, it leads one to conclude that the companies who store our personal data are themselves actually banks.\nBreaking the Bank\nWeb searches, page visits, online purchases, tweets, SMS messages, emails, phone calls, photos, videos, GPS coordinates \u2013 this is the data that makes up our digital lives.\nFor the past decade consumers have sacrificed their privacy, building giant banks of data for companies without any upside exposure to the value that they have created. Thanks to the Bitcoin Protocol and the 21 Bitcoin Computer this no longer has to be the case.\nBillions of photos are shared every day by hundreds of millions of people using smartphones. Between the rapid development of high quality camera phones and the decreased cost for cloud storage, sharing photos from all around the world has become effectively free. Building a library of stock photos once required an army of photographers working around the globe; now this naturally occurs over social networks such as Instagram.\nIn 2012, Instagram came to the above realization and updated their terms of service:\nYou agree that a business may pay Instagram to display your photos in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions without any compensation to you.\u20142012 Instagram Terms of Service change\n(since reverted)\nThe idea of selling users photos without their consent and without compensation wasn\u2019t very popular and the company quickly reversed their decision.\n\u201cWhat Bitcoin brings to the table is a programmatic way of doing small, fast, international payouts to anyone on the Internet. If you can take a photo on Instagram, you can get paid for it in bitcoin. You can take your own data and turn it into your own money.\u201d Dr. Srinivasan told the class.\nBidirectional Payments\nIn addition to allowing consumers to monetize the data they produce, Bitcoin has created a world where the consumer doesn\u2019t have to trade personal data for content. Consumers can instead pay for content up front in small amounts of money known as micropayments. This has previously not been viable because credit cards are not capable of handling such tiny transactions.\nEven if these companies wanted to pay for personal data, the international banking system doesn\u2019t have the infrastructure in place to process small transactions. This is why so many companies, such as Google with its AdSense program, put revenue thresholds\nthat must be reached before a payout. \nWith Bitcoin, highly granular transactions can be executed with ease. Further, every piece of content on a web page can be charged a different amount. Using this article as an example: When someone views the article, payments could be sent directly to the photographer, the author and the publisher, who are likely three separate entities.\nStill, with bitcoin alone, having to manually pay three parties each time you view a Web page is a burden and isn\u2019t likely to be adopted. That\u2019s where 21.co comes in. Their device maintains a continuous supply of bitcoin, allowing users to automatically make micropayments on the Web.\nThe Bigger Picture\nMonetizable data is not just images, articles, reports and videos.\nTake your genome, arguably the most valuable and personal data a person has. In the future, it is likely that every person will have a complete copy of their genome. That is data that could be useful to pharmaceutical companies looking to create new, revolutionary lifesaving drugs.\nUtilizing the 21 Bitcoin Computer, Joe Pickrell created a gateway for genomic data. In exchange for payment, a researcher could rent one\u2019s genomic data. \nAwesome @joe_pickrell developed a #Bitcoin based @21 gateway for genomic data. Want to see my SNP? pay me a Stashoi!\nhttps://t.co/cpPPCSIFbc\u2014 Yaniv Erlich (@erlichya) December 4, 2015\n\nOne-time payments are not sufficient when it comes to genomic data. If a company is able to find a cure for cancer based on the genome of an individual, that individual should be able to generate dividends off that success. \nFinal Thoughts\nFundamentally, these ideas are not new. In his 1980 work \u201cLiterary Machines,\u201d Ted Nelson (he coined the words \u201chypertext\u201d and \u201chypermedia\u201d) introduced the concept of transclusion, a technique computer scientists use to create a large document from snippets of other documents. Nelson originally intended for transclusion to act as a mechanism by which users would make micro-payments to the individual content creators of a document. \nUnfortunately, Nelson was 30 years early. Nelson\u2019s original vision for transclusion, similar to the HTTP \u201c402 Payment Required\u201d status code, was not technically possible until the creation of the Bitcoin Protocol by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Further, it was not truly viable in a production setting until the introduction of the 21 Bitcoin Computer late last year.", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 28}

The new Bitcoin-friendly condominiums went up for sale in the city\u2019s historic Manayunk district at a price of around $365,000 \u2013 or 795 bitcoins, according to Curbed. This makes them the first condos in the city to be sold with Bitcoin users in mind.\nA quick look at the Falcon Condominiums website reveals that the building was once home to The Polish Falcons Club. Now, condos sprawl throughout the structure, boasting hardwood flooring and extra-large windows with views of the city. State-of-the-art kitchens and private outdoor terraces round out the list of amenities, but could flexible payment options also be driving a new type of buyer to these properties?\nIt appears that those who have big money to spend are particularly interested in purchasing property using Bitcoin. In 2014, the Wall Street Journal reported on a Lake Tahoe property that sold for $1.6 million in bitcoin.\nBitPremier founder and CEO Alan Silbert was behind the first large real estate transaction involving Bitcoin back in 2014. The transaction totaled around $500,000, according to HousingWire. Since then, Silbert has continued to see the market evolve directly on BitPremier.\n\u201cI think we are still too early in Bitcoin\u2019s evolution to see substantial changes to the real estate market, but it has certainly started people thinking about disruption to the space,\u201d said Silbert.\nBitPremier, the Bitcoin luxury marketplace, is specifically geared toward consumers who want to spend their bitcoins on fast cars, vacation homes and everything in between (think private islands). Sellers who want to get rid of their luxuries can do so on BitPremier as well, making it a go-to spot on the Internet for all things related to Bitcoin trading.\n\u201cFor now, the appreciation of bitcoin to date has created some wealthy Bitcoiners who want to diversify into other assets, be it real estate, commodities or whatever,\u201d Silbert continues. \u201cReal estate is seeing the benefit of that trend, as we witnessed first-hand with the villa sale BitPremier brokered between a property developer in Bali and an early Bitcoin adopter in the U.S.\u201d\nBut Silbert sees the impact of Bitcoin spreading far beyond the real estate market.\n\u201cEvery major financial institution has one or more people researching Bitcoin or the blockchain.

With the help of the blockchain research team, PwC aims to assist its clients in understanding the Bitcoin blockchain technology and implement it in its services.\n\u201cThere\u2019s clear evidence that banks, institutions and even governments are looking at blockchain technology as a secure storage and distribution solution. Now there is growing interest and a real demand from our clients to help understand the implications of blockchain and how to respond to it. So as the blockchain juggernaut continues to gather pace, PwC will be well-placed to service our clients\u2019 needs at a global level,\u201d said PwC partner and EMEA Fintech Leader Steve Davis.\n\n\u201cPwC is now breaking new ground in developing radical fintech solutions and these appointments represent the first stage of our plans to grow a world-class fintech offering,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe expect the initial core team of 15 experts to grow rapidly, with PwC in Belfast continuing to expand, exploit and deliver technology and digital solutions to global clients.\u201d\nThe team further emphasized that the proposal of U.K. chief scientific adviser Sir Mark Walpor to embrace blockchain technology in facilitating public services such as passport issuance, real estate ownership verification and tax collection inspired the company to actively explore the potential application of the blockchain technology.\nPwC firmly believes that the blockchain technology could significantly reduce costs and enhance traditional financial systems in various industries. Through its growing blockchain team, the company plans to continuously explore the application of the technology in the existing banking systems and transaction settlement systems.\n\u201cBlockchain technology is worrying major players in the financial services industry as they don\u2019t know where it will go or its potential to disrupt business models. However, in document delivery and settlement processing alone, it will offer significant cost reduction and efficiency gains,\u201d said PwC U.K. Executive Board member and U.K. and EMEA consulting leader Ashley Unwin.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that these disruptive fintech technologies will trigger a huge increase in demand for blockchain expertise, and we intend to be a leader in exploiting these disruptive new technologies,\u201d Unwin said.\nOne limitation, according to PwC, is the relatively low level of awareness for bitcoin and digital currencies in general. According to the results of PwC\u2019s forthcoming Global Fintech survey, which polled 545 leading asset managers, fund transfer companies, and insurers, 9 percent of the managers were familiar with bitcoin, but more than 30 percent of the managers had never heard of the cryptocurrency.\nBut the firm still feels optimistic in funding a group of blockchain researchers, as the fintech sector in the U.K. is growing at an explosive rate. \n\u201cThe U.K.\u2019s technology sector is increasingly focusing on fintech as offering radical and disruptive solutions to existing business models,\u201d according to the company. \u201cThe sector raised a record $3.6 billion of venture capital in 2015, with the fintech sector accounting for almost a quarter of all investment raised by London-based tech companies.\u201d\nOver the next few months, the PwC team, which consists of more than 208,000, employees, will actively provide in-depth understanding of Bitcoin the system and raise the awareness of bitcoin the currency within their clientele.", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 21}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBreadwallet is one of the most popular mobile bitcoin wallets that signed the scaling \u201croad map\u201d proposed by Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, CEO and co-founder Aaron Voisine did emphasize, however, that Bitcoin\u2019s block-size limit will need to be increased through a hard fork as well \u2013 and sooner rather than later.\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned that it will become increasingly difficult to make hard forks. We should find a durable solution for scalability as soon as possible,\u201d Voisine said.\nThe block-size dispute, which made headlines throughout 2015, represents a trade-off between the number of transactions the Bitcoin network can handle and its decentralization . \nTo increase the possible number of transactions, Maxwell\u2019s road map \u2013 which found much support among developers \u2013 effectively combines a limited block-size increase with additional optimizations. Importantly, this plan heavily relies on Bitcoin Core developer Dr. Pieter Wuille\u2019s Segregated\nWitness\nproposal , and, as such, does not require a hard fork any time soon.\n\u201cI\u2019m quite excited about Segregated Witness. Breadwallet will support it as soon as it\u2019s rolled out,\u201d Voisine told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201dI am, however, a little concerned that it might delay the hard fork increase, which will still be necessary. It\u2019s important to increase the maximum block size soon for bitcoin to become a major currency, and to maintain an acceptable user experience.\u201d\nAs such, Voisine agrees with a recent opinion piece by Jeff Garzik and Gavin Andresen, in which the two prominent Bitcoin Core developers call for a block-size limit increase in order to maintain Bitcoin\u2019s current low-fee policy. Allowing blocks to fill up, Garzik and Andresen contend, would constitute a radical change to Bitcoin\u2019s economics which, in turn, could harm Bitcoin companies and drive users away.\n\u201cThe risk of not increasing the max block size is far greater than the suggested centralization risk,\u201d Voisine said. \u201cSome developers have a strong status-quo bias when it comes to the network rules, but are failing to consider that the network behavior will change radically as use increases and the rules don\u2019t change with it. With billions of dollars worth of value at stake, it is imperative that we take the conservative route and maintain the existing network behavior in the face of growing network use.\u201d\nTo solve Bitcoin\u2019s scalability issue, Maxwell\u2019s road map envisions a future where most transactions are not recorded on the blockchain at all. Rather, they are conducted on layers built on top of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, which some developers predict will have most of the benefits offered by \u201con-chain\u201d transactions \u2013 plus some extra.\nThis vision is not shared by Breadwallet, however. \n\u201cThese additional layers are interesting research projects, but the Bitcoin network needs to stand on it\u2019s own,\u201d Voisine said. \u201cIt\u2019s ill-advised to let Bitcoin\u2019s future rely on other networks, who\u2019s decentralization, security and stability haven\u2019t been fully researched and tested, and haven\u2019t even been implemented yet.\u201d\nInstead, Voisine believes Bitcoin\u2019s decentralization should be safeguarded through some of the added benefits of Segregated Witness, and other protocol optimizations. In particular, the Breadwallet CEO is excited about Fraud Proofs, a method enabled by Segregated Witness which would vastly increase the security of SPV clients (or \u201clight wallets\u201d) such as Breadwallet.\nAnd while SPV clients would still not be quite as secure as full nodes, Voisine believes fee policy by miners and individual nodes would ensure the Bitcoin network can\u2019t be abused by attackers.\n\u201cThere is still the tried-and-true method of inducing users to pay transaction fees, through default network relay rules, and miner transaction selection rules,\u201d Voisine explained. \u201cFees can be raised using these tools if needed, which will cause users to voluntarily economize on blockchain use at the cost of centralizing small value transactions by pushing them off chain.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 11}

The chip itself is a secure smartcard integrated circuit that provides an electronic purse functionality, and can be inserted into all sorts of devices from MicroSDs to USB sticks and hardware Security Modules.\nBefore The Royal Canadian Mint\u2019s foray into digital currency, the government-owned company offered everything from precious metal storage to spectrometric methods of analyzing gold quality. The Mint produces all of Canada\u2019s circulation coins as well as collector coins. Having tinkered with gold refining in the mid 1960s, the company was able to produce gold with a 9999 fine purity and in 1982, it issued the world\u2019s first 9999 bullion coins. Today, the Mint website offers granulation gold that is 99999 fine.\nThe Royal Canadian Mint originally announced the MintChip to the public in a contest\n. Applicants were challenged to \u201ccreate software applications and proofs of concept utilizing MintChip,\u201d and winners received approximately $50,000 in gold bullion from the Mint.\nThe MintChip itself was originally designed by a team led by Dr. David Everett. Everett is the CEO of Microexpert\nand was one of the few cryptographers who represented UK banks on the original research work designed to improve credit card verification. Everett is confident that \u201cMintChip will gain consumer, merchant and regulator trust as a digital replacement for cash.\u201d\nHaving designed the Mondex\nsmart card electronic cash system used by MasterCard today, Dr. Everett wanted to build a platform that would use secure asset stores to move funds between parties without a central authority, and process transactions both online and offline.\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal in 2014, Canadian Mint spokeswoman Christine Aquino stated that \u201cplans regarding the virtual currency have \u2018matured\u2019 and the Mint considers turning development over to the private sector one of MintChip\u2019s natural next steps.\u201d\nWhen asked about MintChip and digital currency, nanoPay CEO & Founder Laurence Cooke said, \u201cIt is hard to imagine a world in the near future that continues to use cash. Digital currency is inevitable and our MintChip platform has been built to ensure it will exceed the needs of consumers, businesses and governments.\u201d\nCooke said nanoPay aims to make these payments \u201cfrictionless\u201d by combining customer identity, loyalty and payment information into single-use transaction tokens. \u201cDigital cash will transform payments globally, from the unbanked to the largest financial institutions, moving us one step closer to a cashless society.\u201d\nPhoto Skeezix1000\n/ Creative Commons\n\n", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 13}

Immediately after the Paris attacks, there have been calls to increase state control of digital currency transactions to prevent terrorists from using digital currencies to work around state regulation and control of fiat currency transactions \u2013 or to ban digital currencies entirely.\nThe RAND report goes one step further and suggests that governments should use advanced technical means to actively disrupt virtual currencies. That includes terrorist groups, but also peaceful deployments of digital currencies by other non-state actors, and a general war on privacy and encryption. \nAccording to the RAND analysts, virtual currencies demonstrate a resilient means of storing data in a highly distributed fashion that is very hard to corrupt and could permit, for instance, information dissemination (blogs, social media, forums, news websites) that is resilient to nation-state interference. \n\u201c[Virtual currencies] represent the latest step toward decentralized cyber services,\u201d notes the report. \u201cIn particular, the historical trend suggests the development of a resilient public cyber key terrain, which this report defines as the ability of unsophisticated cyber actors to have persistent, assured access to cyber services regardless of whether a highly sophisticated state actor opposes their use.\u201d\nThe report suggests that the U.S. Department of Defense should disrupt decentralized digital currencies to prevent \u201cunprecedented global access to information and communication services that, at its core, is agnostic to the national security interests of the United States.\u201d\nThe RAND researchers analyze key features of decentralized blockchain-based systems, including but not limited to virtual currencies, of which bitcoin is the best-known example. But non-currency applications of blockchain technology, such as sophisticated systems for encrypted storage and emerging forms of decentralized web and communication services, are seen as equally threatening. In fact, one of the effects of the growing popularity of Bitcoin is an increase in the cryptography awareness and sophistication of the population at large. \n\u201cIncreased awareness of block-chain technologies has, as a result, increased awareness of sophisticated cryptographic techniques for distributed consensus and computation,\u201d note the analysts. \u201cVenture capitalists now talk about computer-science concepts [that] would never have been the subject of discussion beyond rarefied academic circles.\u201d \nA key consideration is that digital currencies are still relatively unknown and untrusted by the population. But this will change as more people begin to see the advantages of decentralized, P2P blockchain-based systems for all sorts of value storage and transactions. In fact, digital currencies are becoming more and more popular, not only in the developed world, but also in the developing world where unfavorable economic conditions and inefficient financial systems could push people to accept a non-state digital currency as a viable alternative.\nTherefore, the RAND report seems to suggest pre-emptive strikes and notes that \u201cperhaps the best strategy for the United States and its allies to thwart a VC deployment would be to target those properties of a VC that would most increase its acceptance, most notably transaction anonymity, security, and availability.\u201d \nExamples of promising cyber attacks against digital currencies and blockchain-based systems for other applications are given.\nIn related news, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has recently called for a \u201cManhattan-like project\u201d to help law enforcement break into encrypted communications. Calls for a war on encryption have also been issued by other top politicians worldwide, such as U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron, whose plan to ban strong encryption in Britain has been ridiculed by high-profile Internet activists. A difference is that Clinton and RAND suggest relying more on technical means other than regulations and bans. ", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 11}

T+3 interferes in traders being able to maximize earnings \u2013 payments shouldn\u2019t take days to process while an email can be sent in seconds. As the first use case in many to come, finance is a perfect use for the blockchain.\nBut a trend toward new use cases is emerging, and one industry that is ripe for optimization and increased efficiency using this technology is healthcare.\nConsider all the sensitive information that is associated with health: identity, diseases, treatments, payment, etc. An individual\u2019s health is one of the most private things they have, yet time and again, data breaches release considerable amounts of information about an individual\u2019s health onto the Web.\nHere are two examples of large-scale breaches:\nAnthem: 80 million patient and employee records\nUCLA Health: 4.5 million patients In each of these cases, there was a breach on the network and all of the data became available to the hacker. A single point of failure can cause significant harm to patients.\n\nA blockchain can help prevent this with multi-signatures and cryptography. The data is hashed onto the blockchain and then, using multi-signatures, people can gain access only if there is approval from the appropriate number of people. Using this technology, there could be a rule that for patient records to be accessed, the doctor, nurse and patient must all approve; or, perhaps, 2-of-3 have to approve access.\nBlockchain company Gem, which just raised $7 million\nto expand its enterprise platform, has been working with different stakeholders in the healthcare industry to evaluate the need for blockchain technology. Micah Winkelspecht, CEO of Gem, shared with us that, similar to the financial industry, there are multiple stakeholders in healthcare that need to be considered when designing a blockchain application. He claims that true innovation by blockchains will occur where they connect independent parties to a cohesive, shared-write repository.\n\u201cThe ability to have insurance companies, hospital billing departments, lenders, and patients using one blockchain to manage payments could reduce redundancies across the entire industry,\u201d says Winkelspecht.\nHe goes on to explain that a blockchain network can solve for more than one problem facing healthcare data technology, payment collection being just one faction.\n\u201cIf a blockchain can be used to manage the lifecycle of a hospital bill,\u201d he says, \u201cit could be used to manage the lifecycle of a patient\u2019s medical record. Blockchains allow organizations to share access to their network without compromising data security and integrity. Patient records can be created, shared, and appended by multiple parties, introducing efficiency and transparency to a heavily siloed industry.\u201d\nGem\u2019s platform uses multi-signature, Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), and cryptographic keychains to address identity and information access security, which acts as an application layer to a blockchain protocol. A blockchain can then be used to permanently record network activity, which users can index or append based on access rights defined by the identity framework. \nFactom and HealthNautica are looking to secure medical records and audit trails. This is done by encrypting the data onto the Bitcoin blockchain with a timestamp to verify its accuracy. The records can\u2019t be changed and, because it is hashed to the blockchain, it can\u2019t be accessed without permission. HealthNautica hopes to improve efficiency of claims processing and certainty that the records have not been changed.\nTierion\nis another blockchain startup that has built a platform for data storage and verification using the Bitcoin blockchain. The company announced\nin October of last year that it had completed its first project with the Philips healthcare group. While details of this project are not public yet, Philips global IT innovation lead Arno Laeven told CoinDesk\n, \u201cWe are exploring blockchain in relation to health care just the same as we are exploring many new technologies.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s exciting to many about the blockchain and healthcare interconnection is that it is still such a new field. As companies and healthcare providers see the effect that the blockchain is having on finance, there is bound to be a push toward implementing the same securing and optimizing technology to the healthcare area.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the Distributed Ledger, a weekly email newsletter about enterprise blockchain technology.

SegNet allows developers to experiment with the highly anticipated innovation set to increase Bitcoin\u2019s scalability, extensibility and performance.\n\nSegNet, like the original Bitcoin testnet, is essentially a clone of Bitcoin, specifically intended as a demo version. Bitcoin Core developers Pieter Wuille, Eric Lombrozo, Johnson Lau, Alex Morcos and several others constructed a set of patches in order to establish the new testnet, with an early iteration of Segregated Witness activated.

The idea is widely embraced by Bitcoin's development community, and included as a key part of a popular scalability roadmap proposed by Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developer Gregory Maxwell. (Though not everyone agrees this specific road map is the best way forward.)\n\nApart from Bitcoin Core, several wallet providers have so far committed to supporting Segregated Witness once it's deployed on the Bitcoin network, including Blocktrail,mBreadwallet, GreenAddress, GreenBits, NBitcoin and Lombrozo\u2019s own mSIGNA.\n\nFor more information on Segregated Witness, see Bitcoin Magazine's three-part series on the innovative proposal.\n", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 8}

According to the company\u2019s website, \u201cSymbiont is building the first issuance and trading platform for smart securities on blockchain technology.\u201d \nSmart Securities is a term to describe smart contracts, which are instruments that can be programmed with specific rules.

A smart contract is able to execute the rules it has been programmed to follow without manual interference from any individual or trusted party. \nAn example that Symbiont describes in a blog post\nis a corporate bond, which is coded with the bond amount and its date. \u201cWhen the security is issued, it communicates with the atomic clock and will make payments on the coupon deadline to owners across the blockchain. Friction in clearing and settlement is reduced \u2014 it could be T+10 [Trade + 10] minutes \u2014 and any errors and counterparty risks are eliminated,\u201d the company describes.\nSymbiont was founded when Robby Demody, Evan Wagner and Adam Krellenstein of Counterparty joined with Mark Smith of Money f(x) back in March 2015. Counterparty was one of the early Bitcoin 2.0 projects built on top of the bitcoin blockchain. In essence, it would allow for different financial applications to execute beyond just the peer-to-peer payment network that Bitcoin is.

While there are some niche use cases for Bitcoin in places like the United States, it seems clear that owners of credit cards with cashback programs are not going to switch to the digital currency at any point in the near future.\nMichael Dunworth recently sat down with Bitcoin Magazine to discuss some of his thoughts on the Bitcoin versus blockchain debate, and he explained why Wall Street is focused on blockchain technology, while the developing world has its eyes set on bitcoin.\nSome Countries Would Still Like a Decent Currency\nDunworth understands the current trend is a move away from bitcoin and toward the blockchain, but he does not see the same phenomenon in the developing world. During his conversation with Bitcoin Magazine, the Snapcard CEO said that some parts of the world still have interest in bitcoin as a currency:\n\u201cRight now, everyone is talking about the blockchain. It\u2019s not bitcoin, it\u2019s the blockchain. That\u2019s very USA bubble. If you go to Brazil, Nairobi in Kenya or Argentina, they still need a decent currency. They don\u2019t have a Chase Rewards card that gives them one-and-a-half percent back on everything they spend.\u201d\nIn accordance with Dunworth\u2019s vision, Snapcard has made Brazil one of its main areas of focus. Dunworth gave a presentation to a variety of government officials and central bankers at the Central Bank of Brazil in November, and the company has also partnered with PagPop , which is a payment processor with more than 12,000 merchants in Brazil.\nAmericans Won\u2019t Choose Bitcoin Over Credit Cards\nWhen discussing the consumer adoption of bitcoin in the United States (or lack thereof), Dunworth made the point that Americans already have options that are comparatively better than the cryptocurrency \u2014 at least when it comes to making payments. Plenty of Americans are interested in holding bitcoin as a speculative asset, but the idea of spending bitcoin is less attractive. \nDunworth explained:\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be very hard pressed to find a decent incentive to get someone in the USA to get someone to use bitcoin and say, \u2018Hey. Go spend this over your local currency. Go spend this over your Chase Rewards card.\u2019 [And that\u2019s] the majority of people. Over 78 percent of Americans have credit cards or something ridiculous like that \u2014 of which are tied to a loyalty program of sorts.\u201d\nDunworth did agree that discounts could be used as an incentive to get some Americans on board with spending their bitcoin, and he pointed to Fold and Purse as two perfect examples of the types of apps that could get more people in the United States interested in the digital currency. One of the main points Dunworth attempted to get across during his conversation with Bitcoin Magazine is that there needs to be a compelling use case for someone to switch to bitcoin.\nSo why isn\u2019t Wall Street interested in Bitcoin? In Dunworth\u2019s view, it has to do with the difficulties involved with selling Americans on the idea of using the digital payment system. \n\u201cIn general, the reason why they don\u2019t talk about Bitcoin as much on Wall Street and they\u2019re talking blockchain instead of Bitcoin \u2014 why would they talk about something that doesn\u2019t have a use case? It\u2019s like, \u2018Oh. I can use bitcoin as a currency.\u2019 And [consumers would say], \u2018Why do I need to?\u2019\u201d he said.\nMany Countries Don\u2019t Need to Be Sold on Bitcoin\nDunworth said you don\u2019t need to sell people on bitcoin in certain parts of the world. Once you explain how it works, the idea intrinsically makes sense to them because it is much better than their other currently available options for money, payments or both. \nDunworth used a hypothetical story of a Zimbabwean farmer to explain the contrast between the developed and the developing worlds when it comes to Bitcoin:\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to sell you on [bitcoin in the United States]. You\u2019re like, \u2018Why would I use it?\u2019 If I\u2019m in Nairobi and the dude is wheelbarrowing Zimbabwean dollars across the border to pay for a bag of rice, I don\u2019t have to sell him on anything. That\u2019s the contrast. So the emerging markets are going to see bitcoin as a currency, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to happen in the U.S. or more developed countries.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 11}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nReferred to as the Satoshi client, Bitcoin QT, Bitcoin Core\n, or simply Bitcoin\u2019s reference client, the original Bitcoin implementation as introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto has always set the standard for Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules. While alternative implementations were launched over the years, these were programmed to follow or even enforce existing conduct.\nBitcoin XT\n, the Bitcoin implementation by recent R3CEV\n-hire Mike Hearn, was a first attempt to break with that concept. Regarded a controversial move by many, Bitcoin XT is programed to break existing consensus rules in order to increase Bitcoin\u2019s block-size limit from 1 megabyte to 8 megabytes, set to double every other year until it reaches 8 gigabytes. So far, Bitcoin XT has failed to gain sufficient adoption among the mining community.\nBut its intended strategy does seem to have started a trend. Over the past weeks and months, three additional Bitcoin implementations were introduced, all with the intention of breaking Bitcoin\u2019s existing consensus rules in order to set a new block-size limit.\nBitcoin Unlimited\n\nBitcoin Unlimited\n, a fork of Bitcoin Core, was the first of three new Bitcoin implementations set to increase the block-size limit, and is maintained by lead developer Andrew \u201cthezerg\u201d Stone. Dr. Peter R. Rizun, aspiring managing editor for Ledger\n, the first peer-reviewed academic journal dedicated to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency research, is prominently involved with Bitcoin Unlimited as well.\nRizun, in particular, rose to fame within the Bitcoin community as one of the loudest voices in favor or a block-size limit increase, after publishing a controversial\npaper\nclaiming a block-size limit is not required to establish a fee market. \nBitcoin Unlimited\u2019s main differentiator, as the name suggests, is the absence of a hard-coded block-size limit. Instead, it allows users to manually set this limit on their own nodes; the Bitcoin Unlimited team expects consensus on a limit to emerge naturally at a so-called Schelling point\n. (Though it should be noted that setting the limit above 160 megabytes would be pointless, as the implemented message-size limit will invalidate blocks larger than this.)\nBitcoin Unlimited does include a default maximum block-size setting, or rather, two. The block creation limit, which is used by miners, is set at 1 megabyte. As such, miners will not create blocks that break existing consensus rules, unless they manually choose to do so. (Additionally, Bitcoin Unlimited nodes will not forward blocks larger than 1 megabyte to other nodes.)\nThe block acceptance limit is also set at 1 megabyte, but with an important exception. If a block up to 16 megabytes manages to be included in the longest chain at four blocks deep \u2013 meaning it has four confirmations \u2013 Bitcoin Unlimited nodes will consider these blocks (hence, the chain) valid. This number of required blocks is configurable by users as well, and is intended as a fail-safe to ensure Bitcoin Unlimited users accept only larger blocks if a significant amount of hashing power supports it.\nThis means two things. First, Bitcoin Unlimited will not break existing consensus rules by default, even if it were the only Bitcoin implementation people would even run. After all, miners would never create blocks larger than 1 megabyte. And even if one or several miner(s) manually increased their limit but were unable to find four blocks in a row, nothing would change for these miners exept that they would waste resources mining blocks no one accepts.\nSecond, if one or several miners create blocks larger than 1 megabyte (but smaller than 16 megabytes), and find four in a row, all default Bitcoin Unlimited nodes will consider these blocks valid. But since all nodes still adhering to a 1 megabyte block-size limit would consider these blocks invalid, the blockchain would split into two irreconcilable versions. This situation would last as long as the Bitcoin Unlimited chain remains longer, or until all non-Bitcoin Unlimited nodes switch to accept larger blocks.\nOther than the default settings, Bitcoin Unlimited does not include an automated solution to make sure all nodes apply the same block-size limit. The implementation will, however, include methods for miners and nodes to signal the limits they have set.\nLastly, Bitcoin Unlimited intends\nto introduce a level of democracy into development and management of the implementation. Most importantly, the Bitcoin Unlimited lead developer is to be elected every other year by Bitcoin Unlimited members, and can be removed through a vote of no confidence. Bitcoin Unlimited will also have an elected president in charge of high level management, and an elected secretary to deal with administrative issues. No position has yet been elected, with first elections on January 15.\nAnyone who wants to become a Bitcoin Unlimited member can do so, anonymously if they so please. The Bitcoin Unlimited team intends to limit vote manipulation, but is still considering possible solutions.\nBitcoin Classic\n\nBitcoin miner and developer Jonathan Toomim, FinalHash\nCEO Marshall Long and former Bitcoin Foundation board member Olivier Janssens launched another Bitcoin implementation this week. Named Bitcoin Classic\n, the Bitcoin Core fork intends to increase the block-size limit to 2 megabytes later this year.\nTwo megabytes was picked based on data collected by Toomim, who forked the Bitcoin testnet earlier this year to test global block propagation with large blocks. Additionally, Toomim talked to many Bitcoin miners and \u2013 particularly \u2013 mining pools, and believes the consensus among them also is to increase the block-size limit to 2 megabytes.\nSimilar to Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic will probably increase the block-size limit to 2 megabytes once 750 of the last 1,000 blocks include a message in favor of such an increase. If that happens, a grace period of several weeks will commence, after which all Bitcoin Classic software will automatically accept blocks up to 2 megabytes. If, at that point, other Bitcoin nodes have not changed their software to accept 2 megabyte blocks as well, the blockchain might split into two incompatible versions.\nLike Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin Classic also intends to establish democratic decision-making on code changes, using miner and user input. To establish preference topics, Bitcoin Classic has collaborated with Consider.it\nto establish bitcoinclassic.consider.it\n. Anyone can create an account on the website, open polls on development topics and vote. If a majority of both users and miners (the latter will need to provide proof they are indeed a miner) supports a change, it should be implemented.\nThat does not mean, however, that votes on bitcoinclassic.consider.it are binding. If there are signs of vote manipulation, Toomim will judge whether the voting procedure was conducted fairly. Furthermore, neither Toomim nor other developers are obliged to write code they don\u2019t want to, even if the poll shows a preference for a specific solution that requires coding. And since an automated process to merge code has not been installed (yet), Toomim will still need to manually approve of any change as well.\nAccording to its website and this GitHub page\n, Bitcoin Classic is so far endorsed by former Bitcoin Core lead and Bitcoin XT developer Gavin Andresen (who has done some code review), mining pools AntPool\n(24 percent of hash power) and BW Pool\n(6 percent of hash power), companies Coinbase\nand OKCoin\nand more.\n\u2018BitPay Core\u2019\n\nLastly, major payment processor BitPay\nreleased a fork of Bitcoin Core\n. In a series of blog posts, CEO Stephen Pair announced that the company will experiment with an adaptive block-size limit, in an implementation we will dub \u201cBitPay Core\u201d for now. BitPay might soon start to officially convince others (most importantly, miners) to adopt this proposal as well.\nIn his fourth and last blog post\nof the series, Pair laid out his belief that Bitcoin could essentially work without a fixed limit. However, he believes that would leave a lot of uncertainty for miners \u2013 presumably because other miners might reject blocks of a certain size even without a set limit. As such, he prefers there to be a clear and simple consensus rule for it that all miners follow.\nPair essentially wants to implement two types of block-size limits. One \u201chard limit,\u201d which is the real limit: the maximum block size miners will accept as valid. According to the initially proposed parameters as described by Pair, this limit might be set at twice the size of the medium block size of the last 2016 blocks (about two weeks \u2013 like the difficulty adjustment).\nAdditionally, Pair proposes to implement a \u201csoft limit,\u201d which miners could manually increase or decrease if they choose to. This soft limit is the default limit miners will use to create blocks themselves. Like the hard limit, it will be based on the median of the last 2016 blocks (or so), but with a smaller multiplier \u2013 such as 1.5 instead of 2. As such, blocks miners using the default setting could produce bigger blocks than average.\nBitPay Core is currently still in an experimental phase. BitPay is (presumably) not using the implementation for their services quite yet, and the company is not yet actively promoting it either.\nThanks go out to aspiring Bitcoin Unlimited secretary \u201cAquentin\u201d and Bitcoin Classic lead developer Jonathan Toomim for providing additional information.\n\nNote:\nBitcoin Magazine has not tested or reviewed the code of any of these implementations. Breaking Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules prior to network-wide consensus, as well as other potential bugs, could cost users money.\n\nPhoto Idaho National Laboratory\n/ Flickr(CC)\n\n", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 13}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nOne of the longest-standing questions in the Bitcoin community has been where the technology will take off first. Some have said that Bitcoin makes much more sense in the developing world, while others claim developed nations like the United States have the sort of tech savvy and wealthy population necessary to give this new technology a boost.\nWhile it\u2019s unclear where Bitcoin will find its place in the daily lives of an entire nation first, Snapcard\nCo-Founder and CEO Michael Dunworth\nseems convinced that there is plenty of potential for the peer-to-peer digital cash system in Brazil. In the past, other South American countries have been touted as locations where Bitcoin is booming without much evidence\n, but Dunworth has been working on the ground to help power a revolution in money and payments in Brazil. \nThe Snapcard CEO recently visited the Central Bank of Brazil and gave a presentation on Bitcoin and blockchain technology to officials from various government departments.\nBitcoin Magazine spoke with the Dunworth at last month\u2019s Blockchain Agenda Conference in San Diego\n, and he shared some of the key reasons why, in his mind, Bitcoin simply makes sense for Brazil.\nBrazil\u2019s Versions of Square and PayPal Will Integrate Bitcoin\n\nAlthough there are a number of bitcoin payment processors that operate within the United States, the total number of merchants currently accepting bitcoin is still nothing more than a drop in the bucket. \nThere have been partial integrations of Bitcoin at PayPal\nand Square\n, but the majority of brick-and-mortar payments still take place through devices where Bitcoin is not an option for the merchant. \nAccording to Dunworth, this is also the case in Brazil right now, but that dynamic could change in the near future.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of companies in Brazil \u2013 like the equivalent of PayPal, Square, and all that \u2013 that are all very close to moving on Bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cI think 2016 will be a humongous year for Brazil. These companies aren\u2019t international brands, but for them, they have something like 35 million users.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear if bitcoin payments would be enabled by default on these payment systems, but it\u2019s clear that accepting the digital currency becomes much easier for merchants when it\u2019s at least included as a possible option. Once it becomes widely available to merchants, it then becomes easier for businesses to reap the benefits of the low-cost, irreversible payment system.\nCredit Cards Come with High Fees and Delays for Merchants in Brazil\n\nDunworth also was able to explain the specific benefits of accepting bitcoin for merchants in Brazil. He started by comparing the costs of accepting card payments in the United States to how things work in the South American country:\n\u201cIn the USA, you come along, you swipe your card, you buy a coffee at my Square terminal\n, and I get paid the next day or the day plus one. Within two days, the money is in my bank account. In Brazil, not only am I paying way higher fees \u2013 like between 4 to 7 percent for every swipe \u2013 but that money that you swipe is not in my account for 30 days.\u201d\nWhile there are still some theoretical benefits to accepting bitcoin as a merchant in the United States, it\u2019s clear there is much more time and money to be saved by businesses operating in Brazil. \nDunworth went on to explain the clear contrast between card-based payments and bitcoin payments for merchants in Brazil:\n\u201cYou can pay like a 10 percent fee to get [the money from a card payment] within 3 days or whatever, or you can do bitcoin, which we settle next day. And that\u2019s where you start to see real incentives because the merchant realizes he can get the money tomorrow and he doesn\u2019t have to give up 10 percent of it to get it sooner.\u201d\nDunworth also noted that it would make sense for these businesses to offer incentives to customers who choose to pay with bitcoin. He noted a discount of 7 percent to 10 percent for customers paying with bitcoin could make sense in these situations.\nPayment Delays Increase Operating Capital Requirements\n\nWhen talking about the benefits of accepting bitcoin, most people mainly talk about the direct cost savings of cutting out the fees associated with card payments; however, Dunworth pointed out that there is much more to the story. Due to the long delay from the time a customer makes a card-based payment until the money is in the merchant\u2019s bank account, a much larger amount of upfront capital is required for the business to operate. \n\u201cIn Brazil, they\u2019re sort of like, \u2018Bitcoin is more friendly for me and my operation,\u2019 Dunworth explained. \u201cYou know, if you have an operation selling T-shirts, and you sell $1,000 worth of T-shirts as a small business \u2013 if you sell that much per day, you now need a $30,000 to $40,000 operating capital\nbecause you have to get paid every month. That makes your business a damn expensive business to run, so that\u2019s why you can see they are incentivizing people to give them something that works faster than a credit card, basically.\u201d\nBitcoin has long been touted as a savior for lower-cost payments in the developing world, but the peer-to-peer payment system has yet to catch fire in any of these regions. Dunworth seems convinced that 2016 is the year it will happen in Brazil, and his case for bitcoin in the South American nation is quite clear. \nThe only question left is whether merchants will make the transition to this new digital payment technology and provide the sorts of incentives consumers will likely need to start using bitcoin in the new year.", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 14}

In today\u2019s competitive landscape, company\u2019s legal and compliance teams have to be as innovative and creative as their products and services.\u201d\nAs the Bitcoin ecosystem continues to develop, interaction with government agencies has become more common. In November 2015, the Department of Justice in San Francisco held an event that brought together individuals from the government and industry to talk about Bitcoin. It is through these discussions that rational planning can be conducted before disasters. \nFor example, in the aftermath of the Paris terrorist attack, the European Union was looking to crack down on bitcoin because there was a belief that the terrorists had used it to fund the attack. But through continued education between Bitcoin organizations and governments, it has become clear that law enforcement officials can track transactions on the blockchain to help with their investigations. \n\u201cEducation of law enforcement agencies and regulators is critical to the success of bitcoin and the blockchain,\u201d Jason Weinstein, partner at Steptoe & Johnson and director of the Blockchain Alliance told Bitcoin Magazine\n. \u201cBy educating law enforcement and regulators directly about this technology, we will reduce their fear or anxiety about it, and make government less likely to overreact to it.\u201d\nBoring explained that certain members of Congress, individuals from the Federal Trade Commission, and the FBI had already agreed to attend the event, with the expectation that other organizations would also be in attendance.

This ends the need for the user to give his name, though the company admits its need to collect an email address. Further, by paying with bitcoin, the user can keep the transaction nearly private. \n\u201cI think we need to move towards a more private Internet over time. It\u2019s not going to happen in one step. Usability is important, and I\u2019m a pragmatist.

Srinivasan, founder and CEO of 21 Inc., in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine\ntalking about the announcement. \nThe 21 Bitcoin Computer is a development tool to allow developers the ability to create Bitcoin-payable apps, services and devices. The idea is that the hardware mines for bitcoin and then uses those mined bitcoin to do things. \nFor example, if someone were to build a search engine, rather than flooding the browser with ads, that person could charge 10 bits for a search. By going through the 21 Bitcoin Computer, it would allow for these sorts of apps to be built and for the transactions to be verified. \nIn its announcement, the founders of 21 said, \u201cour long-term goal is to gradually replace advertising with micropayments from mined bitcoin, to build an Internet where you pay with your power rather than your privacy.\u201d\nWhile bitcoin is not nearly as anonymous as many had originally anticipated, there are multiple ways in which a user can keep his or her identity mostly private. Further, by using an email service such as Hushmail a user would be able to create an email alias specific for this purchase. \nThe 21 Bitcoin Computer currently is for sale only in the United States; however, the company is preparing to expand to other countries as it expands international support. \n21 Inc. came out of stealth mode in March 2015 when it announced that it had raised $116 million in fundraising over multiple rounds from Andreessen Horowitz, Data Collective, Khosla Ventures, RRE Ventures, Yuan Capital, along with Peter Thiel and most notably, Qualcomm Ventures. \nUltimately, the company is working on creating embedded mining environment where everything with a silicon chip also has a bitcoin mining chip in it. \nJacob Cohen Donnelly is a consultant and journalist in the Bitcoin space.

Private emails, phone calls and now web-based video calls are all routinely inspected in the name of national security, at least in Western cultures like the U.S. and Great Britain. The Guardian\nreports that Skype has provided \u201cbackdoors\u201d\nto state-run surveillance programs like PRISM for years. In light of these disclosures, the tech and cryptography communities have stepped in to develop encrypted alternatives designed to preserve privacy, such as encrypted messaging like Telegram and Signal or financial privacy with Bitcoin and the blockchain.\u00a0\nBitPhone\nhas started the new year off with an encrypted video \u201cWeb Call\u201d feature that may help users beat the Skype surveillance blues, letting freedom ring once again.\u00a0\nVia BitPhone\u2019s encrypted Web Call system, Bitcoin Magazine\ncaught up with founder Gavin Stephens. The discussion focused on how quickly BitPhone has grown since the public launch of Bitphone Beta in July. With the new year, the company has already unveiled new BitPhone features based on customer demand. For example, besides encrypted video web calls, BitPhone now allows users to pay with altcoins in addition to bitcoins to stay in touch wherever users have an online connection.\n\u201cBitPhone calls have been placed to over 55 countries, and users have paid for calls with Bitcoin and a variety of cryptocurrencies, thanks to our ShapeShift.io integration,\u201dStephens told Bitcoin Magazine\n.\u201cMany users were concerned about their privacy because public switched telephone networks are susceptible to snooping and eavesdropping. Our new Web Call feature connects users peer-to-peer and enables fully encrypted audio and video conversations. These Web Calls can be an audio conference bridge, a streaming video platform, a paid video broadcast or a private conversation. Your video calls never go to any server, so they cannot be monitored or eavesdropped on.\u201d\nWeb Calls are currently two cents per minute for the caller, and the caller can set the receiver to either get the call free or be charged, a benefit for business applications. This means Bitphone users can build a business around a pay-per-minute or pay-per-call service. Whether it is a legal practice that wants to provide a preliminary consultation to tech startups or a new business with partners and customers on opposite sides of the globe, the possibilities are endless for this sort of paid, online functionality.\nUser safety and security are paramount in the value equation, or callers might as well use a centralized service like Skype or Google Hangouts. The contents of Bitphone\u2019s Web Calls are not accessible by any potential government agency since these encrypted files don\u2019t have a centralized server, much like Bitcoin.\u00a0\n\u201cCollecting Bitcoin from Web callers is an excellent way to make money without subjecting your users to endless commercials and ads,\u201d says Stephens. \u201cWe\u2019ve also added a Web Call widget that enables users to call you using Bitphone technology from your own website. Web visitors can simply click a \u2018Click here to call me\u2019 link that uses their browser to call your private number. For a limited time, all Bitphone users who register and maintain a private URL will get free Web Call hosting for life.\u201d\nBitphone\u2019s fully encrypted phone calls and web video calls seem like a great option for the growing digital currency community, either for business or personal use.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin\u2019s block-size dispute rages on. A proposed change to a single parameter in Bitcoin\u2019s reference implementation has spawned into a great debate, resulting in tireless discussion, multiple \nconferences\n, a growing split within the Bitcoin community and at least one prominent developer \njoining\n a bank-run alternative.\n\nThe subject of debate itself, moreover, started out\nin the technical realm, predominantly relating to the increased propagation time of larger blocks, and the level of mining centralization. Over the past year, however, the same debate mostly moved into the political domain, leading to the big question of governance, and the spawning of several\ncompeting Bitcoin implementations.\nBut interestingly, these two domains \u2013 the technical and the political \u2013 are not necessarily separate. Not only do some technological trade-offs require political decision-making, political decision-making can sometimes be influenced by technological trade-offs.\nThe block-size limit provides an outstanding example.\nSocial Implications of Technology\n\nA widespread belief within the Bitcoin community (often employed to excuse the currency\u2019s notorious use on darknet marketplaces) is that all technology \u2013 including Bitcoin \u2013 is neutral, and can be made to serve various ends. Like a hammer, which can be used to build a house or bust someone\u2019s scull, Bitcoin is claimed to be detached from ethics: a mere means. Some even follow this argument to conclude that Bitcoin\u2019s block-size limit must be raised simply because there is demand for increased transaction capacity, as if a dictate by some force of nature rather than a conscious decision.\nBut this neutral perception of technology in general, and of Bitcoin in particular, is false. Design choices can greatly impact what a technology is used for, and especially when made in the early stages of a its development.\nTo illustrate this, let\u2019s explore the evolution of another technology: the bicycle. Shortly after the bicycle was first invented in the late 19th century, initial designs started out as two quite different devices. There was the sportsman\u2019s racer for people who perceived bicycling as a competitive sport, which had a high front wheel that was fast but unstable. And there was the bicycle as a utilitarian means of transportation for people who simply wanted to get from A to B, which had a safer two equal-sized low wheels.\nThe utilitarian bicycle eventually won out. This shifted the energy invested in research and development toward this design, after which it benefited from all subsequent advances in the field of bicycle technology. In retrospect, it may seem that high wheelers were a clumsy predecessor to the modern bike, but in reality the two designs co-existed and competed. Rather than an early stage of the bicycles we know today, the high wheeler represented a possible alternative path of bicycle development, which would have addressed very different problems.\nThe bicycle example is probably an innocent one. But what if the various technical solutions to a problem have different effects on the distribution of power? Then the choice becomes political. And \u2013 importantly \u2013 the political implications of that choice will be embodied in the technology.\nOne telling example of such a choice were the plans for a New York expressway, designed halfway through the 20th century by well-known city planner Robert Moses. This particular expressway included overpasses that were too low for city buses. As such, the lower class from Manhattan who depended on bus transportation \u2013 in large part the African-American population \u2013 was discouraged from visiting the beaches on Long Island. A simple design specification contained a racial and class bias.\nNow let\u2019s see how this notion applies to Bitcoin\u2019s block-size limit.\nConsensus Rules\n\nBitcoin\u2019s block-size limit is one of Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules. These consensus rules are an incredibly important set of rules. Besides the block-size limit, they include, for instance, that the block reward halves every four years (each 210,000 blocks), which limits the total amount of bitcoin to 21 million. They also include that all bitcoin used in a transaction must have a traceable origin (save for the mining reward), preventing users from creating bitcoin out of thin air. And they include that blocks must be created at the required difficulty setting, making sure miners can\u2019t enrich themselves for free.\nBitcoin\u2019s consensus rules are checked by full nodes. Full nodes are Bitcoin implementations that receive transactions and blocks from other full nodes, and verify whether these adhere to the consensus rules their operator installed. If these transactions and blocks check out, transactions are typically forwarded to other full nodes, and blocks are added to the blockchain. (And if a full node is operated by a miner, it will also use valid transactions and blocks to find new blocks.)\nBut if the transactions and blocks a full nodes receives do not adhere to the consensus rules its operator installed, they are considered \u201cnot Bitcoin\u201d by that node, and are discarded. Moreover, all subsequent blocks any miner might build on top of that block are discarded as well.\nThis is crucial to understand, as it means that \u2013 contrary to popular belief \u2013 full nodes do not automatically follow the longest chain of blocks. Rather, full nodes automatically follow the longest chain of blocks they consider valid!\nBut this also means that two groups of Bitcoin users using different consensus rules could effectively create two different and incompatible blockchains. Each group would simply consider the other blockchain \u201cnot Bitcoin.\u201d\nTo prevent such a split (a \u201chard fork\u201d), the consensus rules among all full nodes must \u2013 indeed \u2013 be in consensus.\nFull Nodes and Democratic Empowerment\n\nThe operator of a full node, and only the operator of a full node, decides which consensus rules that full node applies. As such, full node operators decide what kind of transactions they want to accept and, therefore, what kind of Bitcoin they want to use. Full nodes grant individual autonomy to their operators.\nBut operating a full node is not only empowering from an individual perspective; it\u2019s also empowering in a more democratic\nsense, as full nodes carry out social influence through network effects\n. Full node operators are incentivized to apply the same consensus rules as other full node operators, since that allows them to transact. So, as a full node operator decides to use a specific set of consensus rules, the incentive to adhere to these consensus rules becomes stronger for everyone else, too.\nThis social influence can currently be witnessed by the fact that some full node operators would individually prefer to increase the block-size limit to produce and accept bigger blocks \u2013 but don\u2019t.\nOf course, Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules are not set in stone. While network effects make them hard to change, and no full node operator can be forced to, it is possible to make a (near) networkwide switch, providing a strong incentive for all full node operators to join the new consensus rules. Methods such as programmed into Bitcoin XT, allowing full node operators to signal they will make a collective switch in advance, could potentially smoothen this process. Innovations such as proof-of stake voting\nand prediction markets\nmight improve it even more.\nUsers\n\nNot all full nodes are equal from a network perspective. Rather, the weight of each full node is essentially carried by whatever it has to offer the rest of the network.\nFull nodes operated by miners, for instance, potentially offer a lot of security through their hashing power. Full nodes operated by Bitcoin exchanges, payment processors, wallet services and other consumer-based companies, typically offer easy access-points to Bitcoin. And full nodes relying on software that is actively developed and maintained by prudent and trustworthy developers carry a lot of weight through the security they offer.\nMiners, companies and developers all add weight to a set of consensus rules through the full nodes they run and support. But their influence should also not be overstated.\nWhat it\u2019s really about in the end, are all of the bar owners selling beers, immigrant workers sending the fruits of their labor home, citizens escaping inflation or currency controls, investors diversifying their portfolio, and \u2013 yes \u2013 even dealers on the dark Web selling drugs. Without them, miners could not get rid of the bitcoin they mine, companies would have no customers and developers would write code sitting idly on their computers.\nUsers ultimately give Bitcoin value.\nThe Trade-off\n\nWhile Bitcoin users ultimately give Bitcoin value, miners, companies and developers are more likely to operate full nodes than users. And as the cost of running a full node increases, this likelihood increases, too.\nThis presents us with a trade-off.\nBitcoin\u2019s block-size limit limits the amount of possible transactions on the network, which increases confirmation times, or the required transaction fees, or both. As such, it decreases Bitcoin\u2019s utility as a payments system, which could slow down or restrain adoption. This could even limit Bitcoin\u2019s potential as a widely-used technology \u2013 or require more complicated solutions\nto realize that promise.\nBut Bitcoin\u2019s block-size limit is probably also the single most important parameter controlling the cost of operating a full node. It limits the required CPU cost of verifying transactions, it limits the bandwidth cost of sending and receiving transactions and blocks, and it limits the disc space cost of storing the blockchain.\nAnd importantly: Bitcoin users who would like to run a full node but can\u2019t, are excluded from Bitcoin\u2019s consensus process. Above a certain size, increased block-size limit would allow a smaller percentage of users to directly influence the consensus rules.\nUnder such circumstances, rather than empowered participants of a networked consensus process, many worry that Bitcoin users could increasingly become consumers of a product offered by the few entities able to run and support full nodes; miners, companies and, arguably, developers, too.\nBitcoin users could still choose which full node operator they hand their \u201cvote\u201d to, for example by using bitcoin mined by a specific set of miners. Or they could use a company that supports the same consensus rules they do. But this requires trust, and only makes sense if there is at least one full node operator supporting the consensus rules a user desires. (Regulation of companies, and in a very centralized scenario of full nodes themselves, might even completely prevent that.)\nThe block-size parameter, therefore, embodies a certain type of politics.\nThe Current Status of Empowerment\n\nRunning a full node is currently burdensome\n, and perhaps in particular for \u201cthe other six billion\n\u201d: Bitcoin users in developing countries. This is evidenced by the rapidly falling\nfull node count over the past years.\nBut many Bitcoin users could probably still run a full node if they\u2019d want to.\nThis means that even if a super-majority of miners, companies and developers all decide they want to increase the block-size limit, most users could still oppose such a change by firing up a full node and keep applying the existing consensus rules. And since Bitcoin is really carried by its users, a super-majority of miners, companies and even developers would have to cease their efforts \u2013 or make themselves obsolete.\nUsers are effectively still in charge.\nMoving Forward\n\nIn search for guidance on the best way to move forward, both sides of the debate tend to refer to either Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s writings, or Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s perceived vision, or both. But apparent\ncontradictions\nwithin, and alternative\ninterpretations\nof, the Bitcoin creator\u2019s white paper, emails and forum posts have deemed this practice fruitless \u2013 probably even divisive. And if we are to take his words literally, both\nsides\nof the debate seem out of line. We should, therefore, perhaps instead accept that Satoshi was fallible, that his writing are not scripture, and that he could not foresee the state of Bitcoin years down the road.\nInstead, in order to move forward, we should probably apply our own reasoning to the best of our abilities.\nThere is, of course, nothing inherently wrong with the vision of Bitcoin users as consumers, rather than direct participants in a consensus process. Judging by proposals, articles, and comments by several miners, company executives, developers, and regular users, many are OK with such a future, and consider market forces sufficient to offer a desirable user experience for all.\nBut users, in particular, must realize that an increased block-size limit could increase the cost of directly participating in the consensus process. And, of course, that this process is not limited to the block size limit itself \u2013 it also covers all other consensus rules.\nAdditionally, everyone should understand that increasing the cost of partaking in Bitcoin\u2019s consensus process too much might not only exclude their future selves from partaking in that process. It could also exclude users currently unable, as well as future Bitcoin users, from ever partaking in Bitcoin\u2019s consensus process in the first place.\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with the vision of Bitcoin users as consumers rather than direct participants in a consensus process \u2013 as long as everyone understands that the trade-offs are not just technical, but also political.\nThe first part of this article is based on Andrew Feenberg\u2019s Questioning Technology\n.\n\nThanks for suggestions go out to Jan Overwijk, PhD Candidate at the University of Amsterdam.

Skip the bank with our Bitcoin-powered exchange and pay no fees, ever.\u201d\nThe Freemit service, which includes a phone app and a (presumably virtual) credit card, is scheduled to start rolling out in 2016 and incentivize users with $10 in their accounts. In the meantime, interested readers can sign up for a waiting list.\n\u201cFreemit is a financial travel companion that empowers 3.6 billion travelers, students and others with a digital wallet, giving them financial independence to instantly access their financial resources using bitcoin,\u201d reads Freemit\u2019s Crunchbase profile\n. \u201cThey are creating a streamlined, inexpensive alternative to the current remittance and currency exchange systems. Using the blockchain and a local currency in/local currency out vision, they will make moving money cheaper, better, and friction-free.\u201d The company received $120,000 seed funding in January 2015. \n\u201cOur banks are robbing us,\u201d stated Freemit founder and CEO John Biggs as first reported\nby Crowdfund Insider\n. \u201cAnd this doesn\u2019t make sense anymore. Because the world has changed. There is this thing called the Internet, which changed everything \u2026 Except banking. And except money transfer. But that is going to change. It has to change. Why has it taken so long?\u201d\nThat John Biggs\nis behind Freemit is news in itself, because he is a well-known author and editor. He is the East Coast Editor at TechCrunch\n\u2013 see his Crunchbase profile\n\u2013 and former editor-in-chief of Gawker Media\u2019s technology magazine Gizmodo\n. Biggs has written for many high-profile general interest and technology outlets, and authored several books\n.\n\u201cWhat I am interested in are applications which seek to use Bitcoin to supplant our sclerotic, duct-taped global financial plumbing,\u201d says\nTechCrunch\ncolumnist Jon Evans, and mentions as first example \u201cFreemit, headed by TechCrunch\n\u2019s own John Biggs.\u201d\nHow does Freemit get away with providing customers instant cash in any currency with no fees? Of course, an important factor is that Freemit channels transfers through the Bitcoin blockchain, which significantly reduces the service\u2019s costs, but doesn\u2019t explain how the company plans to make money. Bitcoin Magazine\ncontacted Biggs, who said he isn\u2019t ready to talk about Freemit\u2019s business model at the moment, but will be able to say more in a few weeks. \nCrowdfund Insider\nspeculates that the company might monetize the service via credit card service fees.\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s blockchain technology, and the open ledger that all can see, effectively cuts out the need for central banking oversight of transfers,\u201d notes a Freemit blog post\n. \u201cThis makes instant money transfer something that can and should happen in the near future. Instead of complicated transfers between banks, central banks, and receiving banks, Bitcoin creates an easy, entirely digital, transparent and trustworthy system for money transfer.\u201d\n\u201cWhen it comes to foreign exchange transactions Bitcoin is set to shatter the paradigm,\u201d continues Freemit. \u201cBanks charge 3-5% on foreign exchange transfers because they have a monopoly on this system. But the advent of Bitcoin essentially cuts out the middleman on any foreign exchange. Instead of going through banks, Bitcoin exchanges can now function as an instant, automated, and transparent exchange system. With Bitcoin the possibility now exists for the creation of a universal, instant, and cost-free system of international money exchange. Like the introduction of email, the possibility of instant, no cost money exchange is going to revolutionize the future of money.\u201d\nIt seems likely that Freemit, if actually able to operate instantly with no fees, could seriously disrupt the money transfer sector, including the $583 billion remittance industry. As with all essential technologies, Bitcoin will become part of the backstage. \n\u201cAs a bitcoin booster I will like nothing better than to watch bitcoin get boring, says Biggs in his 2016 tech predictions\n. \u201cBitcoin, like the Internet, is part of our worldwide infrastructure.\u201d", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 14}

At the end, we had 10. It\u2019s not all exchanges,\u201d Ben Davenport, CTO of BitGo, told Bitcoin Magazine\n. \u201cWe have a few consumer-facing apps like Fold App. All of these guys are signed up to receive BitGo transactions. Anyone with a BitGo wallet will be able to send to these businesses instantly and be credited on their exchange trading account.\u201d\nThe company announced that it had signed up Bitfinex, Bitstamp, CoinHacko, Fold, Korbit, Kraken, SFOX, ShapeShift, Genesis Trading, and Unocoin. \nWhen a bitcoin transaction is sent, it is not considered safe until it has been included in a block of transactions (\u201cconfirmed\u201d) by a miner and been published to the network. The more confirmations that a transaction has, the harder it is to alter that transaction. \nThe problem is that a confirmation takes approximately 10 minutes, which is the average time it takes for a miner to find a block. For high-value transactions, many Bitcoin companies require 6 confirmations of a transactions, which should take about an hour. \nBitGo Instant works on the same multi-signature technology that BitGo uses for security. Each BitGo Instant wallet has three keys. One is held by the user, one is held by BitGo, and the final is held by a third-party key recovery service (KRS). Any time that a transaction takes place, it necessitates two signatures: the user and BitGo. To commit a double spend, a user would have to collude with the KRS. \n\u201cWhat this allows us to do is, since we have a relationship with the KRS, they will have to communicate with BitGo before they execute an action for a user. As long as the KRS is being the disaster recovery, we\u2019re not worried,\u201d Davenport explained. In essence, if the KRS is used to sign a transaction, it will have to tell BitGo, which will then lock the wallet from participating in BitGo Instant. \nBecause BitGo is so confident in its ability to offer instant transactions without the fear of double spends, BitGo is willing to cover the cost of any bad transactions. \n\u201cWhat we actually do is, when we sign one of these transactions, we produce a cryptographically signed guarantee with financial backing, which is available to the recipient. If that transaction fails to get confirmed within a certain timeframe, for whatever reason, then they\u2019re eligible to make a claim against BitGo and be compensated,\u201d Davenport said. He went on to say that this differed from its insurance policy, which is meant to protect against theft on a BitGo wallet. \u201cWe have not had any claims on that. This is separate. This is backed by BitGo directly.\u201d\nArbitrage Opportunities Become Available\n\nOne use case for BitGo Instant is the possibility for arbitrage between exchanges. The price of Bitcoin can vary between different exchanges, so there\u2019s an opportunity for a trader to make a profit by buying at one price and selling at another. Traders can miss out on these opportunities when transferring from one exchange to the other because of the waiting time needed for confirmations in the blockchain. \nDavenport explained that, while this isn\u2019t the primary use case, it is certainly one that they had considered because there are so many exchanges that use its technology. \n\u201cKraken and Bitstamp have signed up to allow their customers to do direct withdrawal. You would be able to move bitcoin instantly from Bitstamp to BitFinex, and from Bitfinex to Kraken and then to any of our other BItGo Instant partners,\u201d Davenport said. \nBut while the ability to move bitcoin from one exchange to the other would provide some level of arbitrage for selling bitcoin, there remains the fiat problem for arbitrageurs. \n\u201cWe recognize this doesn\u2019t completely solve the problem for arbitrageurs because there is the fiat currency side of arbitrage. Unfortunately, fiat still moves at the Old World speed,\u201d he said. \n\u201cI think what makes BitGo Instant different is transactions are on-Bitcoin-blockchain (no additional new blockchain or hardware); our network is open access. Anyone can get an Instant-send-capable wallet. Anyone can receive it. And the technology is available today and is easy to integrate,\u201d Davenport said. \nBitGo Instant Open to All\n\n\u201cAnybody can query if a transaction is guaranteed by BitGo even if you don\u2019t have a BitGo wallet. That side is completely free,\u201d Davenport explained. By utilizing the BitGo API, any business could integrate with BitGo Instant to open up the potential for 0-confirmation transactions backed by BitGo. \n\u201cThere is a charge on the sender side. When you want to send the BitGo Instant transaction, there is a 0.1 percent fee paid to BitGo. Anything below 1BTC is free.\u201d\nFundamentally, what BitGo is offering is its assurance that it will be able to catch every attempt at a double spend, thus preventing individuals from defrauding others with 0-confirmation transactions. \n\u201cPeople just want to know that someone has their back on a transaction, and that\u2019s all they want. They know that BitGo stands behind its transactions,\u201d Davenport said. \nJacob Cohen Donnelly is a consultant and journalist in the Bitcoin space.

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nCiphrex CEO and Bitcoin Core Contributor Eric Lombrozo gave what was perhaps the most in-depth talk at the recent Blockchain Agenda Conference in San Diego. While most of the other presentations and panel discussions focused on topics such as regulation and disruption of traditional financial institutions, Lombrozo\u2019s talk mainly focused on the technical side of things. In particular, the highly-experienced information security specialist spoke about the possibilities for scaling Bitcoin to many more users in the near future.\nDuring his presentation, Lombrozo covered three key options for scalability that could eventually allow the network to handle much wider adoption of the digital cash system. Although all of the attention has been on a potential increase in the block-size limit over the past year, Lombrozo did not discuss this potential change to the Bitcoin protocol.\nMore Efficient Cryptographic Proofs\n\nCryptographic proofs are not something usually discussed in the wider Bitcoin community, but Lombrozo believes that finding more efficient methods of proving some piece of knowledge via cryptography could be helpful for scalability. He explained:\n\u201cWe need to think in terms of scripting systems which are optimized for efficient proofs. A lot of the computational problems are not really easily amenable to this kind of stuff, but luckily, a lot of the kinds of problems we\u2019re interested in for these kinds of things do offer efficient proofs, which means it\u2019s much easier to verify the proof than to construct the proof.\u201d\nIt\u2019s possible that this option for creating a more efficient Bitcoin network is not often discussed because it is quite technical, but MIT\u2019s Madars Virza gave a talk on the topic at Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong. In his talk, Virza talked about the role of zero-knowledge proofs for Bitcoin scalability.\nIn Lombrozo\u2019s presentation, he noted that some of the new breakthroughs in cryptography still need some time before it would make sense to incorporate them into Bitcoin:\n\u201cSome of the more cutting-edge crypto stuff, like zk-SNARKs, are still too fresh to apply to these financial networks, but there are potential ways in which we could generalize them to solve all kinds of different problems.\u201d\nZerocash, a system for truly anonymous digital payments, leverages zk-SNARKs to fix many of the privacy issues in Bitcoin.\nMore Options for Transaction Validation\n\nAnother opportunity for better Bitcoin scalability comes in the form of more options for transaction validation. Lombrozo explained that not every transaction needs to be completely validated before someone may feel comfortable with accepting it as real:\n\u201cSince it doesn\u2019t make sense to have every single node validate every single transaction by every single other node (because this will never scale), we need to have a way to have more of a spectrum where we can allow nodes to have partial validation where they may not be 100 percent sure, but if they\u2019re 99.999 percent sure that things are correct, then it can cut down on a lot of the validation costs. That might be worth it.\u201d\nAn often-used example here is that one\u2019s purchase of a morning coffee at Starbucks doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be broadcast and validated by every Bitcoin node in the world.\nLombrozo also added that opt-in models for trusting others could also be useful:\n\u201cWe can have opt-in trust models where you could trust a server with the task of validation, but you choose to do that. It\u2019s not something where you\u2019re forced to do it.\u201d\nThe key point here is simply giving users more options when it comes to transaction validation. If less validation is needed on a particular transaction, then accepting a lower trust model can help unclog blocks.\n\nOff-Chain Protocols\n\nThe third way to scale Bitcoin discussed by Lombrozo was off-chain protocols. These are the sorts of options that take transactions off the blockchain and onto federated servers or other low-trust networks. Lombrozo seemed extremely bullish on this option for scaling Bitcoin during his talk. He stated:\n\u201cOne of the most exciting developments this year is the development of off-chain protocols. I think this is one of the most exciting areas that we\u2019ve seen. I think this is probably the most interesting development that has occurred since Bitcoin was created.\u201d\nExamples of off-chain bitcoin transactions include: transactions between Coinbase users, the Lightning Network, Open Transactions, and micropayment channels (best illustration being Streamium).\n\nAlthough the focus of Bitcoin\u2019s scalability debate is still on the block-size limit right now, it\u2019s clear there are still many options out there to consider. Bitcoin Core and the increasingly-popular Bitcoin Classic will both continue to make cases for their scalability solutions in the coming months.\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

The entire world has access to a permissionless ledger, and it requires a digital asset, such as bitcoin, to operate as a financial incentive to encourage people and businesses to contribute their computing power to secure the network. This also deters fraud as the network grows larger. Only a select group of trusted parties is required to maintain a permissioned blockchain.\nSince its foundation, R3 has operated mostly outside of public scrutiny. In an interview with Coindesk this past summer, founder David Rutter and partner Todd McDonald explained that \u201cR3 CEV has been playing a quiet yet concerted game to bring blockchain technology to the world\u2019s largest banks and financial institutions.\u201d\nRecently though, R3 has emerged from the shadows, and company leaders have begun to discuss their plan publically and how it affects bitcoin and the financial services industry. Rutter announced in a press release that \u201cpartnering with a broad range of institutions has always been central to our strategy [and] securing the backing of 42 of the world\u2019s leading banks demonstrates the level of interest in our initiative, and we now look forward to exploring collaboration with non-bank institutions and expanding our already diverse group.\u201d\nOn January 14th The Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution hosted a livecast with a group that included Charley Cooper, the managing partner of business development and marketing at R3 CEV, in what was probably the most thorough explanation of their perspective on the market.\nCooper explained that the focus at R3 has shifted over the past couple years to distributed ledger technology after discussions with both Wall Street bankers as well as technologists. Wall Street bankers have become interested in understanding blockchain technology, and technologists, the ones building the software, need to familiarize themselves with the financial services market anti-money laundering laws and know-your-customer regulations.\nPut simply by Cooper in the webcast, \u201cthere are amazing technology companies who are making really cool stuff that is totally irrelevant to what the financial services market is doing.\u201d Financial services employees operate in one of the most highly regulated markets in the world, regulations that technologists must understand to ensure their technology has a real-life application.\nCooper adds that there are several instances in history where banking consortiums have come together to successfully improve the banking experience, such as Markit Tradeweb, FXall and E Speed Broker Tech. In an interview with American Banker, he explains that R3 CEV is building technology to custom fit the needs of the banking consortium, rather than many financial technology companies that are building software before showing banks, only to find their model doesn\u2019t comply with regulations.\nThe belief at R3 is that innovation is more possible once all the market players are on the same team, rather than the decentralized and open source nature of innovation in the bitcoin blockchain community. In addition, both Cooper and Rutter believe the bitcoin blockchain is not suitable for use on the scale of the financial services market due to its limited block size, the complexity of transactions and regulators not approving of anonymous nodes varying the network. Cooper admitted, though, he might change his mind if regulators began to agree with a permissionless blockchain system.\nOn January 20th, R3 announced the launch of a private distributed ledger that connects 11 member banks using Ethereum technology and hosted on a virtual private network in Microsoft Azure\u2019s Blockchain as a Service. According to International Business Times, the banks to join the peer-to-peer network first include Barclays, BMO Financial Group, Credit Suisse, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, HSBC, Natixis, Royal Bank of Scotland, TD Bank, UBS, UniCredit and Wells Fargo. The successful completion of this network marks an important step for blockchain technology; it is now being used by the world\u2019s premier financial institutions.\nEven if the R3 team is right in that a private network is the best way to stimulate innovation in the financial services industry, there are many applications for Bitcoin and the Bitcoin blockchain in industries outside of financial services. If either Bitcoins\u2019 permissionless blockchain or the permissioned blockchain of the banking consortium picks up more traction in 2016, it will likely have a positive effect on the entire financial technology sector.\n\u00a0\nThis article has been updated to correct the timeline and show that Hearn joined R3 CEV months before his post about Bitcoin's failure.\nThis article has been edited to correct the spelling of firms Tradeweb and Markit\n\u00a0", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 20}

And since the company launched the product in November, there has been a vibrant community in the company\u2019s \nSlack group, with developers exchanging project ideas and tips.\n\nHackathons are one of the most common events that developers participate in because it creates an exciting, competitive atmosphere. Last night, for close to nine hours, developers from the 21 Bitcoin community participated in the first ever hackathon. \nand we\u2019re off! Join the @21 #Bitcoin Computer Hackathon at https://t.co/LjQqHv4nEU! pic.twitter.com/Y2zR6v8dXn\u2014 Andrew DeSantis (@desantis) January 18, 2016\n\nBoilerplate\n\nLeading up to the hackathon, several of the participating developers offered up a $400 bounty for the first person to build a way to order pizza through the Bitcoin Computer. This challenge was significant because the first recorded purchase with bitcoin was a transaction to buy two pizzas. Ultimately, the team realized that the Dominos APIs were antiquated, so pizza was ordered the old fashioned way. \nThe hackathon started with the goal of creating a graphical user interface to allow developers to quickly get started with the 21 Bitcoin Computer, also known as a boilerplate. \nIf you think of it like a starter kit for people that want to make apps on the 21 BTC computer. It\u2019s a really quick way to get up and running to build an app that sort of leverages the 21 libraries and brings up that functionality into a GUI that you can feel and touch,\u201d said Mason Borda, a software engineer at BitGo. \nRight now, when a developer wants to use the 21 Bitcoin Computer, he has to use a command line interface. For many, that\u2019s ideal; however, for other developers, having a nice graphical user interface makes it easier to get started. \nBitcoin Trades Power for Privacy\n\nAfter getting started on some tasks for the graphical user interface, the conversation changed from projects to the philosophy of bitcoin; not as an economic innovation, but a technological one. \nRight now, when we visit a website, we are inundated with ads and cookies, resulting in a slower Internet. Bitcoin creates the potential for a user to reclaim their privacy so that they don\u2019t have to be tracked around the Internet. \nIn the developing world, you will see all kinds of opportunity to open up new commerce and create micropayments for digital services that weren\u2019t previously possible,\u201d said Will Binns, a member of the 21 team. \nBut it was another developer\u2014who requested to remain anonymous\u2014that focused on how commerce was going to become bidirectional once bitcoin became more widely adopted. Whereas now, users are tracked, in the future, consumers will be able to charge companies for their information. \u201cThe companies will ask for information to make the apps stronger and the consumers can demand payment for that,\u201d he predicted. \nGit Money Bounties\n\nBut all of this discussion ultimately culminated in the creation of a brand new project called Git Money. As the night went on, one of the users brought up the potential of crowdfunding projects. His hope was that people might be able to fund other people\u2019s ideas around the world. \nThis concept evolved into Git Money, which converts issues on GitHub into payable bounties. A bounty could be anything from a piece of code, to a graphic or an article. Every issue that is created on a GitHub repository could have a bounty associated with it. Utilizing a bitcoin address, anyone from around the web could help crowdfund it if they felt that the issue was important. \nAnother use case would be a repository owner offering a bounty for a particular issue to be fixed. A company might not have the development resources for a project, so the company could post a bounty on their repository with people sharing their code. \nIt\u2019s not about where you are from as a developer. It\u2019s about how good your code is. With this system, your code speaks for itself,\u201d said one of the participating developers. \nWith each pull request submitted to that issue, the contributor would include their bitcoin address. If that request was merged into the project, the bitcoin in the issue address would be transferred to the bitcoin address of the contributor automatically. \nUltimately, the goal of a hackathon is for developers to get together, share ideas, and work on projects. And last night, developers from all over the country and world shared their ideas on projects that could be built over the 21 Bitcoin Computer.\nJacob Cohen Donnelly is a consultant and journalist in the Bitcoin space.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nIn the midst of a heated debate over block size and Bitcoin\u2019s future, Bitcoin Core developers Dr. Pieter Wuille, Eric Lombrozo and Johnson Lau have launched a third iteration of the Segregated Witness \u201ctestnet.\u201d Dubbed SegNet, the latest version of the Bitcoin test network includes several improvements over its predecessors, and is available to anyone who wants to try it or experiment.\nSegNet, like the previous versions, is essentially a clone of Bitcoin, specifically intended as a demo version. But while the two earlier SegNets were open only to developers working on the project, now everyone can use it.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Ciphrex CEO and Segregated Witness developer Lombrozo said:\n\u201cAll wallet and other app developers are invited to test and experiment with the latest version of SegNet, and offer feedback. We\u2019ve opened up an IRC channel on Freenode, #segnet-dev, and welcome all discussion pertaining to integrating and supporting Segregated Witness transactions in wallets. Many developers have already joined the effort. I\u2019m happy to see the excitement and enthusiasm, and hope many others will join, too.\u201d\nSegregated Witness, the talked-about centerpiece of the scalability \u201croadmap\u201d proposed by Bitcoin Core, is set to introduce several significant improvements to the Bitcoin network. Most important, it allows for an increased number of transactions by circumventing the original 1-megabyte block size limit, using an add-on to existing blocks called the \u201cwitness.\u201d This could increase the effective block size up to some 1.75 to 2 megabytes, depending on the types of transactions.\n\u201cCompared to earlier SegNet versions, this latest iteration includes four main improvements,\u201d said Lombrozo, whose mSIGNA wallet will implement Segregated Witness once it is rolled out. \u201cFirst off, we moved the \u2018add-on anchor\u2019 - the Merkle root of the witness \u2013 to a different part of the coinbase transaction. We did some research, and as it turns out that works better for existing mining-hardware. Second, we changed the signature hashing algorithm such that verification requires fewer steps. This makes running a full node less burdensome, closes off a denial-of-service vector that is particularly nasty for bigger blocks, and decreases block relay time over the network. Third, transaction input values will be signed. This prevents some fringe attack vectors, where users can accidentally pay too high a fee. And fourth, we lowered the cost for typical, non-multisig transactions. Since these are still in the majority on the network, that should increase total throughput.\u201d\nOne of the interesting attributes of Segregated Witness, as first presented at the Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Hong Kong, is that it can be rolled out as a soft fork. This means that to use it, only miners need to change their software; all other users can \u201copt-in\u201d if and when they choose to. For this and other reasons, the Bitcoin Core development team prefers soft forks over hard forks, which require a synchronized network-wide switch of all users.\nOver the past week, however, the idea of implementing Segregated Witness as a soft fork came under increased scrutiny. The team behind the recently launched Bitcoin Classic implementation believes that a change in fee policy is undesirable, questions whether the increased transaction throughput will be sufficient, and points out that there is a security degradation for nodes that don\u2019t upgrade to the latest version of the software. Critics also maintain that the proposed soft fork method requires an \u201cugly\u201d hack, which could complicate development of wallet and app software.\nThe Bitcoin Core development team, however, maintains that the security tradeoffs are highly theoretical and negligible, and far fewer than those associated with a hard fork. They point out that soft forks have been implemented several times before: when multisig was rolled out, or more recently with CheckLockTimeVerify. Core developers also contend that the increased throughput almost equals that of the 2-megabyte hard fork solution planned by Bitcoin Classic, and could in some cases amount to a bit more. They consider the changed fee policy a feature, not a bug, because it incentivizes users to utilize the added space in blocks.\n\u201cAs for the \u2018ugliness\u2019 of the workaround\u2026 I\u2019ll lay it out bluntly here,\u201d Lombrozo said. \u201cA simple block size increase via a hard fork puts all of the burden on the infrastructure rather than the app developers. What we\u2019re proposing with Segregated Witness places a little bit of burden on app developers - which we think is fair. As a bonus, it also means these apps will be ready to support much more sophisticated features in the future, such as smart contracts, the Lightning Network and other payment channel solutions. It\u2019s still not a very complicated thing to support, and many wallet developers seem eager and excited by all this.\u201d\nSegregated Witness is scheduled to be rolled out in Bitcoin Core and the Bitcoin network by April of this year. BitGo, BitcoinJS, BlockTrail, Breadwallet, Coinkite, Coinomi, Digital Bitbox, EI8HT, Electrum, GreenAddress, Green Bits, Ledger, Libbitcoin, libbtc, mSIGNA, Mycelium, NBitcoin, Omnicore and Samourai Wallet have indicated support, so far.\nFor more information on Segregated Witness, see Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s three-part\nseries on the proposal.\n", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 21}

The stated aim of the report is to decrypt blockchain technology for policy audiences and provide policymakers with the vision and evidence to help them to decide where action is necessary, and how best to deploy it.\nIn the foreword, Parliament members Matthew Hancock, minister for the Cabinet Office and paymaster general, and Ed Vaizey, minister of state for Culture and the digital economy, say that distributed ledgers will disrupt how we think about and store data, and propose that Great Britain should take a leadership role.\nThe MPs refer to key national technology assets, including the Alan Turing Institute, the Open Data Institute and Digital Catapult, which are to be put to work to achieve technology leadership and support governmental initiatives. \nIn March, Bitcoin Magazine reported that the U.K. government would launch a new research initiative to bring together the Research Councils, Alan Turing Institute and Digital Catapult with industry in order to address the research opportunities and challenges for digital currency technology and increase research funding in this area by \u00a310 million (U.S. $14.6 million). Now, the Office for Science proposes new steps to start using distributed ledger technology for public services.\nSenior experts from business, government and academia were brought together to assess the opportunities for distributed ledgers to be used within government and the private sector, and to determine what actions government and others need to take to facilitate the beneficial use of distributed ledger technology and to avoid possible harms. The report includes a chapter on the possible government applications in the U.K. \u2013 the eventual impact of distributed ledger technology on British society may be \u201cas significant as foundational events such as the creation of Magna Carta\u201d \u2013 and a chapter on global perspectives.\n\u201cAlgorithms that enable the creation of distributed ledgers are powerful, disruptive innovations that could transform the delivery of public and private services and enhance productivity through a wide range of applications,\u201d says Walport in the executive summary. \u201cThe electronic distribution of digital cash offers potential efficiencies and, unlike physical cash, it brings with it a ledger of transactions that is absent from physical cash.\u201d\nHowever, Walport notes that the strong association of blockchain technology with Bitcoin represents an important problem when it comes to communicating the potential benefits of distributed ledgers to politicians and the public. \n\u201cBitcoin creates suspicion amongst citizens and government policymakers because of its association with criminal transactions and \u2018dark web\u2019 trading sites, such as the now defunct Silk Road,\u201d he says. \nAccording to the report, distributed ledger technologies have the potential to help governments to collect taxes, deliver benefits, issue passports, record land registries, assure the supply chain of goods and generally ensure the integrity of government records and services. In the National Health Service (NHS), the technology offers the potential to improve health care by improving and authenticating the delivery of services and by sharing records securely according to exact rules.\nSee the report, which is freely downloadable, for the full text of the eight recommendations to the British government. Taken together, the recommendations outline an integrated action plan aimed at achieving a systematic understanding of the technical and regulatory aspects of distributed ledgers, and developing a roadmap.\nThe Alan Turing Institute, established in 2015 as the U.K.\u2019s national institute for data science and officially launched in November 2015, is expected to play an important role. The report urges the private sector to consider investing in the Institute to support the pre-competitive research that will ultimately facilitate new commercial applications that are robust and secure. This includes work on obvious areas such as cryptography and cybersecurity but also extends to the development of new types of algorithms.\nMost recommendations call for further study and road-mapping in a typical bureaucratic language of government documents, but two recommendations outline specific implementation steps:\nRecommendation 7: Understanding the true potential of distributed ledgers requires not only research but also using the technology for real life applications. Government should establish trials of distributed ledgers in order to assess the technology\u2019s usability within the public sector.\nRecommendation 3: Government could support the creation of distributed ledger demonstrators for local government that will bring together all the elements necessary to test the technology and its application. A demonstrator at a city level could provide important opportunities for trialling and implementing distributed ledger technologies. Innovate UK could use its work with cities in the development of \u201ccity deals\u201d to implement the development of a city demonstrator.", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 20}

(tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nAndreas Schildbach, one of the developers of the popular\n Bitcoin Wallet\n\n app for Android and maintainer of alternative Bitcoin implementation\n Bitcoinj\n\n, calls for a block-size increase to allow for more Bitcoin transactions. Rather than relying on additional layers built on top of the blockchain, Schildbach believes the network should be designed to scale \u201con-chain\u201d, too.\n\n\n\u201cI personally will not invest my time in lightning networks, at least not for solving the Bitcoin scalability issue,\u201d Schildbach told Bitcoin Magazine\n.\u00a0\n\nThe block-size dispute \u2013 which represents a trade-off between the number of transactions\n\nthe Bitcoin network can handle and its\n decentralization\n\n\u2013 has taken a bit of a turn since a large segment of Bitcoin's academic and engineering community discussed the issue at the upcoming\n Scaling Bitcoin\n\nworkshop in Hong Kong on the 6th and 7th of this month. Core developer and Blockstream co-founder Pieter Wuille\u2019s Segregated Witness\n\n, in particular, is embraced\n\nby many within Bitcoin\u2019s development community. As part of a scalability roadmap\n\nthat needs no hard fork, the proposal could help allow added scaling layers such as the Lightning Network to be rolled out.\n\nSchildbach, who maintains Bitcoinj alongside Mike Hearn (who\u2019s also lead developer of Bitcoin XT) believes raising the block-size limit through a hard fork needs to happen sooner rather than later, however.\n\n\u201cThe Segregated Witness proposal is very interesting, and could provide a valuable addition to the Bitcoin protocol once finished,\u201d Schildbach said. \u201cBut blocks are already full. If we want everyone to use Bitcoin, then we need to make room for them. I believe this matter is urgent, given the time it needs to properly prepare for a hard fork. Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Core developer Gavin Andresen has done extensive tests\n\nthat show that Bitcoin scales linearly up to 20 MB blocks, and improved block compression solutions such as 'thin blocks\n\n' will decrease redundancy in block propagation, limiting centralization risks.\u201d\n\nWhile most within the Bitcoin development community believe the block size needs to be increased at some point even with Segregated Witness on the table, opinions still differ on when and how to do this, exactly.\n\nAndresen's proposed solution, BIP 101\n\n, was implemented by Hearn into Bitcoin XT, and is programmed to increase the maximum block size to 8 megabytes if a threshold of 75 percent of mining power accepts the change. Once activated, this limit is set to double every two years for 20 years, ultimately leading to an 8-gigabyte block-size limit.\u00a0\n\nAn alternative idea is Blockstream\n\nCEO and hashcash inventor Dr. Adam Back's \u201c2-4-8\u201d quick fix, which would incrementally increase to the limit 8 megabytes over four years.\u00a0\n\nSimilarly, Bitcoin Core developer Jeff Garzik\u2019s BIP 102 (or his similar \u201cBIP 202\u201d), proposes a bump to 2 megabytes. Combines with Segregated Witness, this could effectively provide for up to 4 to 8 megabyte blocks, too.\n\nSchildbach, who maintains Bitcoinj alongside Hearn, indicates to be willing to accept almost any solution the Bitcoin community decides on.\n\n\u201cI support any proposal that increases the block size limit, as long as it doesn't introduce pitfalls like the ability to decrease it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the community agrees on a fixed limit of just 2 megabyte, then so be it. It would likely lead to the same discussion in one or two years, but hopefully then the community will have learned from the pains of the 1 megabyte limit.\u201d\n\nSchildbach is sceptical about any solution that does not involve a block-size increase, however. According to the developer, whose Bitcoin Wallet has been downloaded more than a million times, additional layers built on top of Bitcoin designed to scale the system would make things needlessly complicated \u2013 and take too long to develop.\n\n\u201cThe Lightning Network\n\nand similar proposals will cause a complexity explosion on Bitcoin as a whole,\u201d Schildbach said. \u201cIt will take quite a while to implement, test, fix and roll out the protocol. I'm talking of years, rather than months. I'm aware Blockstream is working on the core implementation. But work on necessary infrastructure, like wallets and the payment protocol hasn't even started, as far as I know.\u201d\n\n\n\nPhoto John Fowler\n/ Flickr(CC)\n\n\n", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 5}

Britain has undergone its worst trading start to the new year in 16 years. China, with a long history of command-and-control economics, has enjoyed recent literature about its more laissez-faire ways, but in times of crisis, the government institutes regulations in order to keep the nation afloat.\n\nIn its 25-year history, China\u2019s stock market experienced its shortest day of trading on Thursday. Concerns about capital flight have taken foothold in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\u00a0\n\nThirty minutes after opening, markets ceased trading in order to limit volatility. The Shanghai Composite Index ended its sessions down more than 7 percent at 3115.89. The yuan fell 0.5 percent from its Wednesday rate. Stocks had also fallen throughout Monday.\u00a0\n\nThe yuan fell nearly 1 percent overseas. For the year, the offshore yuan has declined 2.7 percent and is at a record low against the U.S. dollar. The People\u2019s Bank of China stated: \u201csome speculative forces are trying to reap gains from playing [the yuan].\u201d\u00a0\n\nSuch trades \u201chave nothing to do with [China\u2019s] real economy\u201d and precipitated \u201cabnormal fluctuations\u201d in the yuan, the central bank stated. \u00a0\n\nBecause China\u2019s economy is so large, other global currency markets rebalance their currencies so as to negate any benefit that would be felt by Chinese exporters. China, which is often touted as quasi free market, also instituted new regulations, as the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission declared after trading stopped that shareholders owning 5 percent or more of a listed company are barred from selling more than 1 percent of outstanding shares.\u00a0\n\nThey are also henceforth required to notify exchanges of sales 15 trading sessions prior to execution. \u00a0This is set to last three months, but the commision is gaining a reputation for renewing old regulations or instituting new ones.\u00a0\n\nOil prices and the U.S. stock market acted ahead of China\u2019s steep decline on Thursday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined to a three-month nadir, declining 252.15 points, or 1.5 percent, to 16906.51. That\u2019s the lowest close since October 6.\u00a0\n\nThe price of U.S. crude oil declined 5.6 percent. The S&P 500 fell 26.45 points, or 1.3 percent to 1990.26. Nasdaq fell 55.67 points or 1.1 percent to 4,835.76.\u00a0\n\nEuropean stock markets also suffered a \u201crollercoaster\u201d ride this week. Britain endured its worst new yearstart to trading in 16 years.\n\nMike van Dulken, of Accendo Markets, told The Telegraph: \u201cGold is still attempting to break out beyond two-month falling highs around $1,075 as it benefits from safe-haven demand amid market volatility and geopolitical risk.\u201d\n\nAmid the chaos, Bitcoin has firmed its bearings at $450, acting in much the same way it usually does when stocks become volatile as they have across the globe in the first week of trading.\u00a0\n\nAlthough engulfed in a bit of a \u201cconstitutional crisis,\u201d Bitcoin appears to enjoy healthy demand in times of crisis, almost acting as a safe haven asset as investors call commodities and investments that do well in times of uncertainty.\n\n\n\nNot only has the raw Bitcoin price done well in the new year, but so too has the public market-based Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Winklevoss twins\u2019 Gemini Exchange has seen a spike in trade volume in the past 24 hours. So, it appears that, while global stocks panic, those based in Bitcoin sustain the crisis quite handsomely.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe shaky markets could be fallout from the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s recent small increase in the interest rate .25 percent from December when it raised the benchmark interest rates for the first time in almost 10 years.\u00a0\n\nThe Federal Reserve called its December decision a \u201cclose call.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe Fed said:\u00a0\n\nIn the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the December FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the second half of this year was little changed, on net, relative to the projection for the October meeting. The staff\u2019s medium-term projection for real GDP growth was revised up slightly, on balance, from the previous forecast, primarily because the recently passed Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 was anticipated to lead to somewhat higher federal government purchases.As a result of the recently passed Bipartisan Budget Act, federal spending was expected to provide a modest boost to economic activity over the next few years.\n\n\nThe Fed made the entire world nervous by keeping interest rates low for nearly a decade. This built anticipation inside the global investor that, once interest rates raised, this forebode economic uncertainty.\u00a0\n\nPerhaps this is what is now playing out in the beginning of 2016, perhaps not. Nobody knows what the Fed\u2019s decision regarding raising interest rates will have. Commodities are continuing to fall, which hurts many nations and global producers, including the so-called \u201cBRICs\u201d who were supposed to power the global economy through the recession.\u00a0\n\nPhoto 2 dogs / Flickr(CC)", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 7}

From 55 GH/s to 180 GH/s the chop follows nearly linear slop of efficiency from ~0.06 J/GH to 0.2 J/GH,\u201d said Valery Vavilov, CEO of BitFury, in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine\n. Further, the 16nm chip is capable of running with a power supply voltage of 0.35 V.\u00a0\nThe cooling mechanism used with these mining chips is an important factor in determining the maximum hashrate. According to the company\u2019s announcement, for miners using a traditional air cooling setup, the ASIC will be able to reach hashing power of 140 GH/s. However, by using liquid immersion cooling, the chip can reach hashrates of up to 184 GH/s. In October, \nBitFury announced\n that it would be using 3M\u2019s Novec 7100 Engineered Fluid for immersion cooling in its data centers.\n\u00a0\n\nBitFury partnered with GUC, a Taiwanese ASIC design service company, to design the custom 16nm chip. \u201cWe have worked closely with BitFury\u2019s experienced IC designers and we are glad to assist BitFury to achieve this outstanding result. GUC is proud that the BitFury-GUC partnership resulted in the first 16nm full custom tape-out for both parties,\u201d said Jim Lai, President of GUC, in a statement.\u00a0\nAs the size of the chip gets smaller, it becomes increasingly difficult to mass-produce them.\u00a0\n\u201cNeedless to say, this technological advancement didn\u2019t come easy and there were challenges to getting there but we are extremely pleased with the result,\u201d said Vavilov.\u00a0\nWhile the chips are being produced, there are no miners incorporating the chip are yet being manufactured.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are working on several designs and will announce in near future,\u201d said Vavilov. \u201cWe are planning to roll out the products starting from late Q1 2016. Price point will be determined by the total performance of the product and will be lower by $/GH than anything that is available on the market at this time.\u201d\nA Trend Toward Decentralization\n\nThroughout 2015, there was a growing concern among the Bitcoin community that the mining space was centralizing, with the larger operations continuing to grow their share of the network and building new mining farms.\u00a0\nHowever, with the recent launch of the Antminer S7, the BW miner, the new Avalon ASIC, and now the BitFury, it appears that smaller miners are able to purchase the newest, most efficient, and cutting-edge chips developed by the large chip manufacturers.\u00a0\n\u201cBitFury is fundamentally committed to being a responsible player in the Bitcoin community and we want to work with all integrated partners and resellers to make our unique technology widely available ensuring that the network remains decentralized and we move into the exhash era together,\u201d Vavilov told Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0\n\nJacob Cohen Donnelly is a consultant and journalist in the Bitcoin space.

It can act as a decentralized exchange for bitcoin.\n\nWhy Stellar? After years of working in the fintech space, I realized that the world\u2019s financial infrastructure is fundamentally broken, leaving billions without resources. As a result, Joyce Kim and I co-founded Stellar.org to create an open standard for financial technology. Since anyone can participate in the network, it can be particularly helpful for the 2 billion unbanked people worldwide.\n\nSince the launch of Stellar, we\u2019ve announced several partnerships, spoken at the United Nations and unveiled a new consensus algorithm and codebase. Along with other contributors to Stellar Core \u2014 Professor David Mazieres, Graydon Hoare and Nicolas Barry \u2014 I had the task of designing this new codebase. I\u2019m excited to share some of the motivations behind the design decisions and to talk about projects that Stellar\u2019s future might hold.\n\nUpgrade to a simple, modular network\n\nOne of the key principles that facilitated organic growth of the Internet was its low-level simplicity. With this in mind, we designed the upgraded network with complexity moved to the edges. With simple primitives that can be composed in different ways, the system is robust and maintainable, yet still expressive and powerful.\u00a0\n\nThe upgraded Stellar network is more secure, scalable and modular. We separated the network\u2019s responsibilities into multiple components to make them easy to understand, maintain and extend. Stellar Core is now less than half the size of the previous codebase. It stores data in a standard SQL database, making it easier for people to get information out of the Stellar network and interact with it using standard tools and libraries. Graydon\u2019s presentation provides granular details on the movement and locations of data in the Stellar system.\n\nSafety first\n\nOne of the main reasons we refactored the code was to implement the new Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), which has a unique, provably correct federated consensus algorithm.\u00a0Distributed systems are complex, and achieving consensus in a decentralized network is even more complex \u2014 it requires a fully understood and proven consensus algorithm like SCP, which ensures the network will not fork.\u00a0\n\nFor maximum safety, we simulated many failures through unit and integration tests. We also used an interface and model that connects Stellar Core to Kyle Kingsbury's Jepsen tool for testing distributed systems against network partitions. In all these cases, the network halts until quorum can be re-established, at which point it picks up and carries on. The network must halt in these conditions. The other option is to fork, meaning two sides of the network disagree about the state of the world. Not forking is a critical feature of any distributed, decentralized consensus algorithm and the one we've spent the most time trying to get right.\n\nSmart contracts\n\nFollowing our overarching design philosophy, we focused on creating simple components that users can combine in complex ways to get the behavior they need. Our approach to smart contracts has been to keep most of the logic outside of the core system so that Stellar Core can scale globally.\n\nThe two key components of smart contracts on the Stellar network are multi-signature support and the ability to batch operations. Accounts can now have multiple signers with various weights, so you can simply set up m-of-n accounts or other, more complex, access schemes.\n\nTransactions are now a series of operations that affect the state of the world. For example, a single transaction can trivially say A sends to B if B sends to C. These abstractions, coupled with the network\u2019s distributed exchange, produce a surprisingly rich vocabulary for contracts. Bonds, escrow, collateralized debt and the Lightning Network are all possible on the network.\u00a0\n\nCommunity-run network\n\nThe live network is entirely run by community participants outside Stellar.org. We want to ensure that the network does not wind up operated or administered primarily by us. Stellar.org contributes to the open-source core protocol, but everything beyond that \u2014 everything that actually makes the network useful and valuable \u2014 is up to the community!\n\nLooking toward the future\n\nWe're currently developing tools and protocols that live above the base Stellar protocol and support future features such as messaging and private transactions.\n\nI have a long list of interesting ideas for things that could be built on Stellar. I jotted down a few of my favorite ones here:\u00a0https://github.com/stellar/docs/blob/master/other/things-to-build.md\n\n\n\nHonestly, I'm most excited to see what people come up with on their own \u2014 I know there will be amazing ideas that we haven't even thought of yet.\n\n\n\n\nJed McCaleb is co-founder and CTO of Stellar.org. In 2000 he developed e-Donkey, one of the largest file-sharing networks of its time. He later created Mt. Gox, the first bitcoin exchange, which was subsequently sold and re-coded by its current owners. Find Jed online on GitHub,  LinkedIn, and  Twitter.\n\n\n", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 6}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nJohn Jegutanis, co-founder of bitcoin and altcoin mobile wallet\nCoinomi, recently proposed the concept of \u201dSoft Blocks\u201c to help scale Bitcoin. Soft Blocks, Jegutanis says, could reduce the risk of increasing Bitcoin's block-size limit.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, he explained: \u201cIt is not so much the block size \u2013 although yes, it must be increased \u2013 but the inefficiency of our current block relay mechanism that needs solving.\u201d\n\nThe block-size dispute \u2013 which made headlines throughout 2015 \u2013 represents a trade-off between the number of transactions the Bitcoin network can handle and its decentralization.\u00a0\n\nWhile larger blocks would allow for more transactions, these blocks would take longer to propagate over the network. This could increase the rate of pruned (\u201corphaned\u201d) blocks, as miners will build blocks on top of older blocks while newer blocks are still making their way to them. Some worry this would favor larger miners (and pools) more than smaller miners, as larger pools don't need to wait for blocks as often; they mine more blocks themselves. (Additionally, a higher prune rate would decrease Bitcoin\u2019s security overall, as the hash power invested in these blocks doesn\u2019t secure the network.)\n\nJegutanis' Coinomi was one of the first Bitcoin wallets to test Bitcoin XT \u2013 designed to hard fork a block-size limit increase through BIP 101. While Coinomi is compatible with Bitcoin XT, Jegutanis decided not to enable it in production until developer consensus has emerged.\u00a0\n\nJegutanis still supports a hard fork to increase the block size, however, and proposes to decrease propagation time through Soft Blocks.\u00a0\n\nSimilar to other potential block propagation improvements such as IBLTs and \u2013 in particular \u2013 \u201cWeak Blocks,\u201d Soft Blocks do away with the need to transmit full blocks over the Bitcoin network once a block is found.\u00a0\n\nInstead, miners can effectively transmit a confirmation and proof that they, indeed, found a block, which requires much less data to be sent around the network. This vastly decreases propagation time, limiting pruning risk.\n\n\u201cWhile it is true that slow propagation favors larger miners, I believe we can relegate this to a theoretical concern only,\u201d Jegutanis explained. \u201cIn reality, miners will want to propagate their blocks to as many miners as fast as possible; they would be gambling otherwise. Solutions such as Matt Corallo\u2019s relay network and soft blocks will help them with that.\u201d\n\nAs such, Jegutanis believes the block-size limit should be increased more rather than less. While he supports the Segregated Witness - heavy scalability road map as laid out by Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developer Gregory Maxwell, Jegutanis indicated he believes Bitcoin will need a hard fork to increase the block-size limit in the longer term.\n\n\u201cI think Segregated Witness is a really, really smart 'hack' that solves many problems,\u201d Jegutanis said. \u201cBut it creates a new problem: It's effectively a block-size increase that the peer-to-peer network cannot efficiently handle. We, therefore, need a solution to increase block propagation as well, like soft blocks. And if we have that, we might as well increase the block-size limit a lot more. BIP 101 solves the problem of full blocks for once and for all. We will never hit this ceiling as we are hitting the 1 megabyte ceiling recently.\u201d\n\n\n\nPhoto Emile Aben / Creative Commons\n", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 7}

The people of Brazil are generally more skeptical and curious about Bitcoin than those in Venezuela, according to Souza..\u00a0\n\n\u201cAs of now,\u201d says Souza,\u201dBrazilian regulators said that they won't regulate Bitcoin because regulating also means that the government is placing a stamp of approval; they also believe the technology is currently in its early stages and doesn't represent a risk to the financial system.\u201d\n\nThe central bank of Brazil in the past has said that bitcoin currency is too volatile and not backed by any government. Additionally, the Brazilian tax authorities have stated that traders should declare their bitcoin and should report any capital gains.\u00a0\n\nOf the five largest Brazilian banks, \u00a0three of them haven\u2019t announced their position on bitcoin. The two other banks are very against bitcoin, and have shut down or blocked bank accounts for trading bitcoin.\n\nAt a glance: Venezuela\u00a0\n\n\nThe Venezuelan exchange SurBitcoin is a result of partnership between VK Inversiones/Vipples and BlinkTrade.\u00a0\n\n\u201cVenezuelans on the other hand, are a completely different story. In order to understand Venezuela we have to understand that our numbers only reflect 10 percent of what is going on in Venezuela,\u201d says Souza.\u00a0\n\nVenezuela is home to a vibrant bitcoin community, where people often trade goods and services for bitcoin. \u201cBitcoin is generally viewed by Venezuelans as a positive innovation,\u201d adds Souza.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cVenezuela has much bigger problems to solve in their country than their Brazilian counterpart,\u201d Souza said.\u00a0\n\nVenezuelan government officials have never communicated their stance on the technology, but Venezuelan law is very clear on its definition of money, and bitcoin doesn't fit in that definition. Bitcoin is considered property rather than money in Venezuelan law.\u00a0\n\nSurBitcoin was approached by Venezuelan authorities under the allegation of illegal money exchange.\u00a0\n\n\u201cSince Bitcoin is not considered money under Venezuelan law, we were fine,\u201d says Souza, \u201cThey did not take further action.\u201d\n\nSince the creation of SurBitcoin Exchange in August of 2014, SurBitcoin has given new users 100 bolivares worth of BTC upon opening an account in order for them to learn how the technology works. In 2014, the 100 bolivars represented close $1.30. Today,15 months later, SurBitcoin still provides users with 100 bolivares, but that amount is now worth $0.11. The average salary at that time was close to $250 per month. The average salary in Venezuela is close to $20 per month. Even ATMs in Venezuela limit withdrawals to 20,000 bolivars, or about $22 USD at time of publication.\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut since the Venezuelan economy contains such strong price controls,\u201d says Souza, \u00a0\u201cthis also means they pay the cheapest electricity bill in the planet. We know a mining farm operator who has close to 1 petahash \u00a0of power and his electricity bill is close to $20 per month. The average electric bill for 320kw consumption is close to 6 cents. This means that \u00a0a person mining bitcoins with old equipment at home makes more money than an engineer working 160 hours a month.\u201d\n\nThis makes it a fruitful environment for mining bitcoin. Most bitcoin sold in Venezuela are either mined in Venezuela or sent by Venezuelans living abroad to help their families.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI would say that 10 percent \u00a0of our 10,000 users are de-facto bitcoin miners. Additionally, a lot of people buying bitcoins in large quantities on SurBitcoin are buying because it is the only way for them to import new miners,\u201d says Souza.\u00a0\n\nAdditionally, many of SurBitcoins\u2019 users are people turning their savings into bitcoin. Many of their users buy bitcoin in very small portions consistently in order to save money. Since the only way to get U.S. dollars in Venezuela is through the black market, there are many scammers who take advantage of the situation to rob people.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIf authorities find out people are doing this, they will not stop the operations, but rather ask for a bribe to pretend they never saw it\u2026. purchasing bitcoins turns to be the only safe, legal investment in Venezuela where people can safely buy using their bank account,\u201d Souza said.\n", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 6}

The Azerbajiani manat, the national currency of Azerbaijan, has lost nearly 32 percent of its value practically overnight due to the falling price of oil.\n\nOn December 18, the value of Manat recorded an all-time low against the U.S. dollar since January 13, 2006, plummeting from 0.96 down to 0.65.\n\nAccording to the Observatory of Economic Complexity, petroleum oils and gas exports in Azerbajan generated more than $26 billion in income, accounting for more than 90 percent of the economy\u2019s entire revenue.\n\nDue to its heavy reliance on the oil industry, the abrupt price drop of crude oil and gas severely devalued the national currency of Azerbaijan, pressuring the central bank to implement currency flow restrictions and gain control of the foreign exchange market.\n\n\u201cAzerbaijan is an oil country, and countries like Azerbaijan cannot discount the factor of drop in the price of oil \u2014 the main source of their budget,\u201d Ali Hasanov, said in an interview with the Azerbaijani Press Agency. \u201cEveryone knows that oil prices in world markets won\u2019t rise in the near future.\u201d\n\nThe unexpected devaluation of the manat has affected cross-industry businesses operating in the country and corporations dealing with international suppliers and partners outside of Azerbaijan.\u00a0\n\nFinancial experts including Simon Mandell, senior vice president of Central and Eastern European, Middle East and African equities at New York-based frontier markets brokerage firm Auerbach Grayson, believe that the economy of Azerbaijan will continue to crumble amid the oil price slump and will affect the operations of existing businesses.\n\nEssentially, in the short term, businesses will attempt to avoid the use of the manat until it recovers from its recent price slump. This could lead to disputes between its suppliers, international partners and its customers.\n\nUnfortunately, the manat, like many other reserve currencies in the world including the Nigerian naira are dependent on the performance of certain assets or industries such as oil, and will continue to become more volatile and unpredictable in the upcoming years.\n\nIn these situations, it is beneficial for both companies and countries to use independent currencies with high and stable international value and exchange rates such as the U.S. dollar. However, many have suggested that bitcoin may be able to fill this role for trade and commerce both internationally and domestically.\n\nHistorically, the price of bitcoin has not been closely correlated with the performance of other currencies or assets. Instead, its price is wholly dependent on the demand of its users and potential buyers as the supply of Bitcoin mined is fixed and predictable. Thus, if bitcoin is able to fill the role of as a store of value and as an independent currency, it could help developing countries such as Azerbaijan avoid financial issues regarding its currency.\n\nAs Nick Szabo proposed during the strict capital controls implementation in Greece, every aspect of an economy must embrace bitcoin for it to operate as an independent currency and a store of value.\n\nIt will be highly unlikely for economies such as Azerbaijan\u2019s to embrace bitcoin, especially due to its poor financial infrastructure. However, depending on a currency which relies on a single asset to determine its value is risky and detrimental to businesses with international operations.\n", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 8}
