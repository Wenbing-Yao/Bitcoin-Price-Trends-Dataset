The increase came even amid last year\u2019s crypto winter, which saw virtually every digital asset in circulation lose a significant chunk of its value.\nInvestment Scams Reign Supreme in Australia\nThe report reveals that most of the victims of scams in Australia were targeted by fraudulent investment schemes. These schemes often compel investors to purchase one form of crypto or another, and, in some cases, the victims are convinced to make crypto-based payments for investment opportunities in forex, commodity trading and other trading schemes.\nThe report notes:\n\u201cTo avoid the fraud and scam detection systems employed by banks, scammers are now increasingly asking for payment via unusual payment methods such as gift cards and cryptocurrencies.\u201d\nMillennial Men: The Most Susceptible Victims\nThe report also claims that out of all the 674 crypto scam cases that were reported in 2018, over half of the victims were men between the ages of 25 and 34. This number could actually be even higher, as the report suggests that some victims were likely too embarrassed to report the scams.\nThis isn\u2019t particularly surprising. Last year, a survey conducted by U.S.\u2013based financial services firm Bankrate revealed that a more significant percentage of millennials (people between ages 18 and 37) believe that bitcoin (BTC) is the best way to store money that they won\u2019t need for the next decade.\nOver 80 percent of the victims were also reported to have been contacted by scam perpetrators via some form of internet-based media (the most popular were online forums, social media and email) frequently used by millennials.\nFiat Scams Are Even More Devastating\nHowever, while there has been a reported spike in the rate of crypto scams in Australia in 2018, the ACCC also reported that the amount lost in fiat currencies was much worse.\nA similar report published by the commission on April 29, 2019, stated that financial losses amounted to $489.7 million. With crypto scams amounting to just $4.3 million, fiat-based scams seem to remain the most popular modus operandi for scammers in the country.\nDelia Rickard, the deputy chair of the ACCC, said, \u201cThe total combined losses reported to Scamwatch and other government agencies exceeded $489 million \u2014 $149 million more than 2017. And these record losses are likely just the tip of the iceberg. We know that not everyone who suffers a loss to a scammer reports it to a government agency.\u201d", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 29}

Its two sats? Drop the bars, buy the bits (and the dip).\nThe Digital Currency Group off-shoot has launched a \u201cDrop Gold\u201d campaign that encourages investors to ditch the old asset for its digital counterpart, bitcoin.\n\u201cEveryone loves a piece of gold jewelry, but is gold really the best investment in today\u2019s digital world?\u201d This is the rhetorical question that the website challenges its readers to consider. \u201cGold represents the past,\u201d it continues, saying that Nixon dropped the gold standard that backed USD back in the \u201970s.\nThis statement, accompanied by a caricature of the Watergate president, is tinged with irony. Nixon nixing the gold standard officially cemented the USD as a fiat currency, and this has become one of the primary examples bitcoin advocates cite when discussing why the cryptocurrency matters.\nWith the campaign comes a commercial featuring suits and financiers lugging around hordes of gold. \u201cWhy did you invest in gold? Did you invest in the past?\u201d the commercial asks its viewer, asserting that \u201cgold shouldn\u2019t weigh down your portfolio.\u201d Unencumbered after dropping their own gold holdings, a man and woman race through the streets of a city which is populated with people struggling to schlep caches of gold by way of a shopping cart, baby carriages and a dolly.\nCoinciding with the commercial\u2019s first mention of bitcoin in an ostensible (and cheeky) nod to the industry, a lamborghini comes skidding around a street corner with several hundred millions of dollars worth of gold in tow.\n\u201cCryptocurrencies like bitcoin are the future. They\u2019re secure, borderless, and unlike gold, they actually have utility,\u201d the commercial posits. This last point feels a bit too pointed and a tad ironic, considering it ignores gold\u2019s crucial utility (among other things) for computer circuits and the very hardware that allows us to access the internet and, by extension, bitcoin.\nToward the end of the 39-second ad, a woman is weeping over a trove of gold coins spilled at the subway entrance, and gold bars are literally raining down from the sky as they are flung from a helicopter in freefall, apparently weighed down by a net hoisting an inordinate quantity of gold bars.\nGrayscale\u2019s Ambitious Campaign\nThe rest of website rehashes much of what the commercial emphasizes, harping on gold\u2019s weight as an obvious downside to bitcoin, which, as a lighter and less-frictioned investment option, \u201cis weightless and can be bought, sold, and transferred as easily as a text message.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that gold is bad,\u201d it qualifies. \u201cIt\u2019s just that bitcoin is better,\u201d offering a link to an article explaining Grayscale\u2019s reasoning.\nThat reasoning becomes more apparent down below as Grayscale promotes GBTC, its bitcoin investment vehicle.\nThis trust is one of many cryptocurrency investment vehicles that Grayscale offers, which includes ether, litecoin, stellar lumens, ethereum classic, zcash, xrp and bitcoin cash (most, if not all, of which are held by Grayscale\u2019s parent company, Digital Currency Group). Its bitcoin investment trust was launched in 2013. According to the website, you can buy and sell GBTC with ally, Charles Schwab, E-Trade, Fidelity Investments, Interactive Brokers, TD Ameritrade, Trade Station and Vanguard.\nThe campaign is a bold crusade against what many believe to be bitcoin\u2019s physical predecessor, and one that shares many of the Austrian values that bitcoiners believe give the digital alternative value over fiat. Gold bugs argue that the two are dissimilar and that bitcoin holds no intrinsic value; this argument is a bit like looking in the mirror, considering the retort from bitcoiners is one and the same.", "year": 2019, "month": 5, "day": 1}

However, this pullback barely made a scratch on the market structure as we didn\u2019t manage to break our trend of higher lows.The move was swift, but after a few days of sideways consolidation, the market is now seeing a retest of macro resistance in the $5,300 level. So far, the market has yet to reclaim the broken support, but the move is still freshIf we manage to close above the $5,300 level, this would mark a very bullish feat for our market structure as we continue to test and reclaim support level after support level. If we can close a daily candle above the $5,300 level, it\u2019s very likely we will see a continuation of the uptrend and test the $5,800s.At the moment, the short interest is very high and the market seems to be absorbing every bit of ammunition the bears throw at it. As time moves on, we are seeing a high amount of short positions stack up around the $5,300 zone.

Considering that transaction histories can be easily traced on the public ledger, anyone with the technical know-how and resources can perform transaction analysis to de-anonymize users.\nCoinJoin works by allowing multiple users to pool their individual transactions into a single, grouped transaction. This, in turn, scrambles the funds in this pool to obscure the link between sending and receiving addresses. This shuffling greatly improves anonymity and has become a favorite of privacy-minded bitcoiners.\nLonghash\u2019s report acknowledges that several early spikes in the relative prominence of CoinJoin-type transactions can be attributed to early tests of the technology and the release of Shared Coin integration in 2013. These experiments ended, and Shared Coin integration was shuttered in 2014, so these spikes have diminished significantly.\nOne of the greatest boosts to CoinJoin adoption so far has been the advent of Wasabi Wallet: The company\u2019s introduction to the crypto industry is now largely responsible for more than one out of every 25 bitcoin transactions using CoinJoin technology.\n\nSource\nFirst debuting in October 2018, Wasabi Wallet is a project intended to make the possibilities of CoinJoin easily accessible and convenient for the average user.

Once the refund hits this account, BitPay converts the cash to sats and sends it to whatever wallet address the user provided upon sign-up (this sign-up, as one would expect, includes KYC).\nA press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine highlights that the move is in line with Refundo\u2019s wider focus on lower income and poorly banked populations.

As bitcoin adoption steadily grows, Refundo believes we can serve as an innovative payout process for our clients. Refundo\u2019s focus has been on serving the underbanked, which is at the core of bitcoin\u2019s rise, so it\u2019s a natural fit. More than that, it gives taxpayers an incentive to save. Instead of splurging when your refund arrives (this is typically the case in low-income communities), CoinRT can act as a saving mechanism and ensure taxpayers are more fiscally responsible,\" he told Bitcoin Magazine.\nHead of Business Solutions at BitPay Rolf Haag told us that the partnership answers \u201ccustomer demand in multiple verticals for Bitcoin Payouts. It also signals that the \u201cglobal marketplace\u201d for payouts in bitcoin is growing.\n\"Recipients want choice, especially for high cost alternatives like bank wire receipts or pre-loaded debit cards.

Additionally, it requests that the Supreme Court of the State of New York stay the NYAG\u2019s order, meaning Bitfinex would not have to comply with a May 3, 2019, deadline requiring the exchange to produce documents related to a $900 million line of credit Bitfinex established with Tether to stanch the $850 million loss.\nAuthored by Stuart Hoegner, who has served as Bitfinex and Tether\u2019s legal counsel since 2016, the affidavit is scathing in its rebuke of the Attorney General\u2019s claims. Hoegner writes that the Office of the New York Attorney General\u2019s (OAG) \u201cpreliminary injunction serves no useful purpose\u201d and that it \u201chas succeeded only in spreading misinformation to the markets.\u201d\nMarked throughout with a tone of defiance, the letter asserts that \u201cTether holders are not at risk,\u201d despite the NYAG\u2019s framing of the situation in its own letter. Further, it claims that Bitfinex self-reported its troubles with Crypto Capital to the NYAG, the payment processor that allegedly led to Bitfinex\u2019s $850 million loss of customer funds.\nHoegner admits that Tether is operating under a roughly 74 percent reserve \u2014 but also argues that this practice is not a problem.\nThe AG Doth Protest Too Much?\nThe affidavit begins in defense of Bitfinex\u2019s relationship to Crypto Capital, whose refusal to wire funds to Bitfinex back in 2018 bottlenecked fiat withdrawals for many customers, the NYAG\u2019s letter states.\nBitfinex had to rely on Crypto Capital\u2019s services because it had been ostracized from proper banking relationships, Hoegner claims, citing how its complications with such banks as Wells Fargo is a perpetual thorn in the industry\u2019s side.\nAccording to the letter, Bitfinex, among other exchanges (like QuadrigaCX in Canada) that used Crypto Capital for makeshift banking, began experiencing withdrawal problems in 2018. This was on account of Crypto Capital having a substantial amount of its funds seized, the document states, affirming that \u201cat least one governmental entity has confirmed that it was involved in the seizure of Crypto Capital funds.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s more, the document alleges that \u201cBitfinex proactively and voluntarily informed the Office of the New York Attorney General (\u2018OAG\u2019), as well as various U.S. federal law enforcement agencies of its issues and concomitant concerns with Crypto Capital.\u201d\nThe letter continues, \u201cOn information and belief, those federal agencies have since been investigating Crypto Capital on a non-public basis at the time of OAG\u2019s application and press release regarding this matter.\u201d\nHoegner continues to make the case that Bitfinex orchestrated a \u201cgood-faith solution\u201d when it debited $625 million from Tether\u2019s reserves, along with establishing a $900 million line of revolving credit with the stablecoin company, to cover the losses incurred from Crypto Capital.\nThe counsel argues that this was done \u201cfor the protection of the virtual currency market,\u201d and he suggests that the NYAG\u2019s recommendation for the New York Supreme Court to enjoin Bitfinex from drawing on this line of credit would harm the market\u2019s participants.\n\u201cOAG purports to wonder what \u2018benefit[s] would accrue to Tether, or holders of tethers, from this transaction,\u2019 the obvious answer is that Tether, and holders of tether, have a keen interest in ensuring that one of the dominant trading platforms of tethers has sufficient liquidity for normal operations.\u201d\nBiftinex\u2019s upper echelon began orchestrating the deal in December of 2018, and according to the document, Bitfinex alerted the NYAG to the deal \u201cone month before it was closed, providing OAG a general overview of [it].\u201d The NYAG makes mention of this in its own letter, but it qualifies that it wasn\u2019t alerted of the deal\u2019s final structure until after it was finalized and that it had changed from its first draft.\n\u201cThe description of the transaction differed significantly from what OAG was told just weeks earlier in the February 21. 2019 meeting. and included new information about a previous. undisclosed transfer of $625 million from Tether\u2019s reserves to Bitfinex,\u201d the ex parte order reads.\nHoegner makes no reference to the $625 million Tether transferred to Bitfinex\u2019s Bahama-based Deltec bank account; it only touches on $675 million that was transferred from Bitifinex\u2019s Crypto Capital account to Tether\u2019s Crypto Capital account for \u201cthe protection of Tether.\u201d\nThis transaction, which the document claims took place on an \u201carms-length basis\u201d was signed for both sides by the same representative counsel, Giancarlo Devasini.\nUnder the Tether\nThe letter continues to say that the deal has not interfered with Tether\u2019s usual business dealings as the NYAG\u2019s letter might suggest, adding that \u201cthe average daily fiat redemption has been $566,066.00, with the largest being $24.2 million.\u201d\nThis is drawn from a reserve of \u201ccash or cash equivalents (short term equivalents)\u201d of $2.1 billion. With its market cap at $2.8 billion, that means Tether is running at a 74 percent reserve, Hoegner admits, going further to say that Bitfinex can draw on the line of credit until this percentile drops to 68.\nWith a deposit-to-reserve ratio of 3 to 4, Bitfinex is doing leagues better than banks that are legally obligated to only hold fractions of reserves at or lower than 10 percent, the document points out. That Tether is operating with fractions in its reserves has also been well covered by industry media, Hoegner argues, when Tether made changes to its website\u2019s policies.\n\u201cMarket participants appear to understand that tether is not at risk,\u201d Hoegner concludes. Turning the tables, the lawyer argues that the NYAG\u2019s \u201cmisleading\u201d letter did more damage as the market shed some $10 billion in capitalization in response, and he argues that \u201cmarket confidence in U.S. Dollar tether remained strong, as tether continued to trade at $0.99\u201d \u2014 this is after USDT dipped to $0.97 following the news.\nIn a memorandum defending Hoegner\u2019s stance, Zoe Phillips, an attorney for Tether, argues that the NYAG has no business meddling in Bitfinex and Tether\u2019s affairs as long as there is responsible disclosure.\n\u201c\u2026 the Attorney General has no authority to dictate how Bitfinex and Tether do business with one another, or the amount of reserves that Tether must hold. The Martin Act is an antifraud statute enacted to ensure that there is proper disclosure about the risks associated with the sale of securities and commodities \u2026 Tether states plainly on its website that tethers are backed by reserves in various forms, specifically including \u2018loans\u2019 to \u2018affiliated entities.\u2019\u201d\nFor its own part, one of the NYAG\u2019s qualms with the line-of-credit arrangement is that Tether holders and Bitfinex users were not informed.\nStill, Hoegner\u2019s letter draws the same conclusion that the \u201cOAG\u2019s application contains numerous mischaracterizations and omissions that undercut its request for injunctive relief.\u201d It gives no indication that Bitfinex will comply with the NYAG\u2019s demand to comply with a series of requests by May 3, 2019, arguing that it would \u201cimpede the normal operations of Bitfinex\u2019s business.\u201d", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 30}

It will also include an event floor for builders to showcase bleeding-edge tech and hardware, and on the other side of the coin, an installation room for crypto artists like the renowned cryptograffiti.\n\u201cBitcoin 2019 is specifically curated with attendee participation in mind, making the most technical of concepts as approachable as possible. The best way to illustrate Bitcoin\u2019s many breakthroughs is to showcase them firsthand,\u201d Bailey said.\nBitcoin Games\nThe conference will also see the culmination of a worldwide hackathon. The Bitcoin Games, as they are called, will be an online competition that will take place in the weeks leading up to the conference, with the winners and awards to be doled out during the conference itself. This international and virtual competition will motivate developers to push the boundaries of the technology to create solutions and applications for the next wave of adoption.\n\u201cBitcoin 2019 is about realigning our collective focus toward what really matters \u2014 innovation, community, inclusivity and memes. It\u2019s about bringing together the industry to build relationships as well as partnerships. It\u2019s about rekindling the excitement around the future of how value is stored and transacted. It\u2019s about playing around with magical internet money until you stumble upon something so transformative you can\u2019t take your mind off it,\u201d Bailey concluded.\nInterested?

To some people, this means Bitcoin is only useful to people who want to get around various regulations imposed on the world\u2019s financial systems and society more generally.\nAnd in a way, these Bitcoin critics have a point. Bitcoin can be quite useful for criminals, much like physical cash. However, the permissionless nature of Bitcoin also enables other valuable use cases of this new technology.\nBitcoin is simply a tool. And that tool can be used by both good and bad people.\nNon-Criminals in the Developed World\nIn the developed world, bitcoin has mostly been used for price speculation. People simply want to bet on the future potential of this new digital asset. That\u2019s not a crime.\nIn addition to outright speculation on bitcoin and altcoins, there are those who already view bitcoin as a credible store of value due to its difficult-to-corrupt monetary policy.\nHaving said that, there are also some nonspeculative use cases for bitcoin that have gained traction in places like the United States and Western Europe.\nIf someone wants to protect their financial privacy online, bitcoin is often seen as the best available option. Although privacy-conscious altcoins, such as Monero and Zcash, have increased in popularity, bitcoin is still generally preferred in this niche due to its own privacy improvements (Samourai Wallet and Wasabi Wallet come to mind) and various network effects.\nSeeking privacy does not necessarily mean someone is doing anything wrong. Some people are simply becoming more conscious about the amount of personal data they hand over to third parties, especially in light of Facebook\u2019s ongoing privacy controversies.\nThere are also a variety of other, admittedly niche, Bitcoin-related activities that can be found in the developed world \u2014 such as saving money on Amazon purchases via Purse.io and timestamping.\nAdditionally, it should be noted that \u201ccriminal activity\u201d is a rather subjective term. While some bitcoin users may technically be criminals, much of this activity may be seen as morally acceptable by the vast majority of society. Does anyone really care if someone buys a small amount of marijuana on a darknet market?\nFurthermore, what\u2019s illegal in one country may be legal in another.\nNon-Criminals in the Developing World\nBitcoin has long been touted as having the ability to \u201cbank the unbanked\u201d around the world. While some of this narrative is likely overblown, at least for now, it\u2019s true that Bitcoin can be a solution in the developing world for holding digital value (especially in countries dealing with high levels of inflation) and gaining access to the internet economy.\nIssues around identity and reputation make it difficult or uneconomical for banks to provide services in some markets, so Bitcoin can be helpful in filling in the cracks found in the global financial system.\nThis access to the global economy is also much more difficult for local tyrants to control when it\u2019s enabled by Bitcoin. For example, families leaving Venezuela are able to more easily hold onto their savings by placing it into a Bitcoin private key rather than something physical like cash or gold.\nThose who don\u2019t believe the developing world will want to hold an asset as volatile as bitcoin should look at an app like Abra, which allows users to peg the value of their bitcoin to basically any real-world asset.\nThe developing world also accounts for the other side of the aforementioned Purse.io. Much of the Amazon credit liquidity that powers the site purportedly comes from Amazon Mechanical Turk workers in the developing world.\nThe key attribute that these use cases in the developed and developing worlds share is that they rely on the existence of a digital bear ecash like bitcoin. Much like the development of the internet itself, the permissionless nature of Bitcoin has the potential to unlock large amounts of value for the world.\nThis is a guest post by Kyle Torpey.

{"title": "Delphi Digital's Latest Report Says Bitcoin\u2019s Market Cycle Is Right on Track", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/delphi-digitals-latest-report-says-bitcoins-market-cycle-is-right-on-track/", "birthday": "May 2, 2019  11:41 AM EST", "date": "2019-05-02 16:41:00", "content": "Colin is an associate editor and staff writer for Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0 He's proud to call Nashville his home, where he lives with his family and doesn't eat hot chicken as much as you might think.\u00a0\n\nDelphi Digital has returned with another installment of its unspent transaction output (UTXO) reports. Recalling its report from January of this year, the research firm says bitcoin\u2019s market cycle is right on track. The prior report called Q1 as the bottom of the bear market, and this claim was later corroborated by Adamant Capital\u2019s own evaluation.\nAs before, Delphi Digital\u2019s evaluates UTXOs as presages of market buying and selling, and by extension, the future trajectory of the market. UTXOs is a technical way of describing the last time bitcoin was moved by looking at the last block a transaction was included in.\n\u201cUTXO age distribution over time provides insight into the buying and selling patterns of previous market cycles. This allows us to forecast where we are in relation to prior cycles and what we can likely expect going forward,\u201d the report states.\nBottom In?\nThe starkest finding in the report is Delphi Digital\u2019s belief that \u201cbitcoin has bottomed,\u201d consistent with its prior analysis.\nGoing on the assumption that the bottom occurred in December at roughly $3,200, \u201cthe 1 Year + holder rate was 53.9% at the time, which falls right in line with the 1 year+ holder rate of 53.5% during the price bottom of the previous cycle in January 2015.\u201d\nIn a nutshell, this means fewer long-term holders are selling. As price rises, long-term holders move coins to sell, the coins change hands and the number of 1+ year UTXOs falls; as prices fall, 1+ year UTXOs rise as long-term holder selling pressure exhausts. So per the report\u2019s data, long-term holding is inversely proportional to price action.\nAn encouraging data point, these long-term holders didn\u2019t sell during the previous price rally to $5,000, something Delphi Digital says happened frequently during the market\u2019s rollercoaster price swings in 2018. What\u2019s more, the 1\u20132 and 5+ year UTXOs are growing, a trend that indicates younger UTXOs are being held onto for longer periods and graduating to older lifespans. Delphi Digital sees this as a strong sign of accumulation.\n\u201cThis pattern of very gradual hoarding among older bands was also visible in previous cycles after the bottom was decidedly in,\u201d the report states.\nFewer holders are willing to sell right now, the report continues, because the chance that investors/traders will be able to buy back lower is potentially diminishing. Delphi Digital\u2019s data suggests this so-called reflexive scarcity was prevalent in previous market cycles as well, and it\u2019s another indicator that gives it confidence that the worst is behind us.\nAnd there\u2019s plenty of data to suggest as much. Delphi Digital continues throughout the report to cite optimistic measures. One of these shows that, in 2019, bitcoin has outperformed a host of other legacy investments, including oil, the S&P 500 and gold. Interestingly, it also draws correlations between the rise and fall of Chinese equities and tech stocks with bitcoin.\nThe report winds down by claiming that bitcoin is gaining some momentum, charting this progress with 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages. Most importantly, when bitcoin transcended $5,600 on exchanges a few weeks ago, the 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day moving average in what\u2019s known as a \u201cgolden cross.\u201d This technical indicator is renowned in all walks of investing as an extremely bullish signal, though Delphi Digital notes that, with the exception of a cross in October 2015 that preceded the 2017 bull market, three of bitcoin\u2019s previous golden crosses have led to \u201csizable declines.\u201d\nStill, in light of its other analysis, Delphi Digital believes that this golden cross is likely a good sign.\n\u201cBitcoin is still trading comfortably above its 200-week MA, offering some reassurance the cycle bottom for BTC was put in back in December. BTC would have to drop 32% from its current level ($5,225) to retest its 200-week MA and nearly 40% to retest its December low.\u201d\nDelphi Digital rounds out the report by charting the trading consistencies between the current market cycle and the 2013\u20132015 cycle, noting that the consistencies \u201calign with [its] UTXO analysis.\" It also notes that investor sentiment has been on the rise in recent months, according to research from TheTie.io.\n\u201cFurther price appreciation is likely to continue if average daily sentiment score remains at current levels. However, if sentiment score starts to roll over, we anticipate price to revert a bit. Overall, it appears traders are still more positive about Bitcoin than the end of 2018, confirmed in recent conversations we've had with analysts at TheTie.io,\u201d it concludes.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

The results, compiled from an online survey taken by 2,029 American adults, reveal that Bitcoin has been growing in the eyes of the public, despite its shrinking price.\nOverall, the results show that more people have heard about Bitcoin now than during the middle of the last hype cycle, when the October 2017 survey was administered. The more recent one from this April, Bogart points out, shows that not only are more people aware of the digital currency, but \u201cfamiliarity, perception, conviction, propensity to purchase and ownership [of Bitcoin] all increased/improved significantly.\u201d\n\nA significant takeaway from the comparison of the two surveys shows that Bitcoin is a demographic-wide trend that has always been led by younger people. The survey data suggests this is true in all but one category: awareness. \u201cRegardless of age, the vast majority of the American population has heard of Bitcoin,\u201d writes Bogart.\nThis is not too surprising as Bitcoin has never left the scope of mainstream media since its historic rise to almost $20,000.\nDespite the nearly 75 percent drop in price since the peak of the bull market, 27 percent of all people surveyed said that they are likely to purchase bitcoin soon, as opposed to only 19 percent back in 2017.\nMore notable, however, were the responses collected when asked what they would rather own $1,000 worth of today. Of the people surveyed, 21 percent said they would prefer bitcoin to government bonds, 17 percent said they would prefer it to stocks,14 percent said they would prefer it to real estate, and 12 percent said they would prefer bitcoin to gold.\n\nMillennials Lead Bitcoin Adoption\nAmong the notable differences shown from the data comparison is the percentage of people between 18 and 34 who are \u201cat least somewhat familiar\u201d with Bitcoin in April 2019 compared to October 2017\u2014 almost 50 percent more people are familiar with it. In fact, this group of people is three times more likely to be familiar with Bitcoin as those who are over 65.\nYounger people, as the data suggests, have the most positive view of Bitcoin as well. Specifically, 59 percent of people between 18 and 34 \u201cstrongly or somewhat agree that Bitcoin is a positive innovation in financial technology\u201d in 2019, which is 11 percent more than in October 2017. This makes practical sense when considering that millennials are the demographic most familiar with the digital world, which includes peer-to-peer networks like BitTorrent and Napster.\nThis trend could perhaps be attributed to millennials vividly experiencing the 2008 financial crisis and being exposed to the potential risks of central banking and poor financial management \u2014 which, coupled with their familiarity with the internet, could be why it is easier for this demographic to grasp the concept of Bitcoin before people who were around before the advent of the internet.\nOf course, the numbers should support such a thesis, and it appears that they do. According to the April 2019 survey, while 9 percent of the overall population owns some bitcoin, 16 percent of those aged 18\u201334 are bitcoin owners.\n\n\n", "year": 2019, "month": 5, "day": 1}

According to CoinMarketCap, there are now 255 major crypto exchanges. That\u2019s a notable increase from a year ago, when there were 208.\nA booming exchange industry sounds like a positive, but we can do with fewer exchanges for cryptocurrencies to establish themselves as a dominant force in the global financial system.\nFor crypto to truly thrive, the ecosystem needs only five or six exchanges \u2014 and certainly no more than a dozen \u2014 in the long run. Here\u2019s why.\nGrowing Crypto\u2019s Market Cap Will Be Possible With Fewer Exchanges\nTo get a sense of crypto\u2019s exchange problem, consider the ratio of crypto exchanges / crypto market cap compared to equities exchanges / total equities market cap.\nToday\u2019s 255 major crypto exchanges are home to about $175 billion worth of cryptocurrencies (total market cap). Distributed evenly, this amounts to $686 million in cryptocurrencies per exchange. In equity markets, 60 major stock exchanges control $69 trillion in global equities, or roughly $1 trillion in equities per exchange. Thus, the average stock exchange is 1,457 times bigger (in market cap of listed assets) than its average crypto peer.\nThe last 200 years of economic progress shows us that investors, companies and the economy all benefit from there being a few regulated exchanges in each jurisdiction. Indeed, New York City became the financial capital of the world with just two exchanges: NYSE and Nasdaq.\nThe crypto ecosystem similarly needs recognized, name-brand exchanges that retail and institutional investors trust and feel comfortable transacting across. Today\u2019s hodgepodge of exchanges fails to inspire confidence among the many people who are not yet sold on crypto\u2019s long-term viability.\nNext-Gen Innovation Will Only Be Possible on a Few Exchanges\nThe traditional role of a crypto exchange is to provide liquidity. This function is and always will be vital, but for the crypto ecosystem to mature, exchanges must broaden their mandate beyond trade execution and into the world of payments and personal finance.\nOne possible catalyst for this shift can be crypto\u2019s evolution from a store of value into a form of payment. The former\u2019s domination of crypto\u2019s first decade enabled the launch of countless exchanges, and the 2017 ICO bubble furthered this proliferation as entrepreneurial types realized they could quickly launch exchanges and profit handsomely from listing new tokens. Even if not, exchanges carry the responsibility to simplify, educate and bring consumers onboard the crypto bandwagon.\nThe crash in crypto prices was an important wake-up call for exchanges and other infrastructure developers. The industry started to realize that crypto\u2019s continued growth will depend on broader usability and scalability. Exchanges with innovative, customer-centric services will be the ones thriving in 10 years\u2019 time.\nFor example, Lightning Network payments is one form of innovation that crypto exchanges can harness to increase crypto\u2019s everyday functionality. As a second-layer protocol that enables instantaneous settling of funds, Lightning Network represents the future of point-of-sale crypto payments. Exchanges that incorporate Lightning into their wallet infrastructure can gain access to a vast, untapped market. (We at Zebpay have prioritized Lightning integration).\nOnce a handful of exchanges develop and scale these next-gen features, there will be organic consolidation as consumers flock to the exchanges with the best services.\n\u201cExchange Overload\u201d Is Against the Crypto Ethos\nThere\u2019s a more foundational reason why we need fewer crypto exchanges: reducing market friction, i.e., lowering fees.\nMany of today\u2019s exchanges charge high fees for makers and takers. This business model benefits exchanges, but high fees risk stunting broader adoption of cryptocurrencies. Today\u2019s consumers are accustomed to using technology platforms like Facebook and Google \u201cfree\u201d of charge, and they won\u2019t be lured into crypto if participation is costly.\nIn the current environment, high competition is causing some exchanges to lower fees, but ironically, this competition (and the fragmented nature of the exchange market) is compelling most exchanges to continue charging fees to meet revenue targets.\nIn a world with fewer exchanges, there are other ways for these businesses to make money. Mining fees are one option. So too are premium, subscription-based services. The tiered subscription model would allow exchanges to attract a wide range of consumers, but this will only be possible once a few exchanges establish themselves as the dominant players.\nThat said, I also believe that centralized exchanges are an interim solution to simplify the crypto world for consumers and, as technology evolves, we look forward to the emergence of decentralized exchanges. For crypto to meet its objective, it must empower the individual.\nThis is a guest post by Ajeet Khurana.

We are excited to continue our collaboration with Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, municipal energy distributors and municipalities.\u201d\nQuimper added, \u201cWith green hydroelectricity at a competitive price, innovative universities and this recent decision by the Energy Board that clearly supports the industry, Qu\u00e9bec has all the ingredients to become a blockchain hub,\u201d\nThe Energy Board decision ordered Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec to set aside an extra 300 megawatts for the crypto industry, on top of 368 megawatts already committed, and rolled back Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s plan to make crypto businesses compete in an auction.\nAs with some other parts of Canada, a cool climate and abundant hydroelectric power make Quebec a natural fit for Bitcoin mining.\nBitfarms operates one of the largest vertically integrated mining operations in North America and has four computing centers located in different locations in Quebec: a head office in Brossard, a microelectronics laboratory in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu and an electrical contracting company in Bromont (Volta \u00e9lectrique), in addition to an expansion currently underway in Sherbrooke.\nThe company told us they have built 36 megawatts of capacity, with another 125 megawatts in their pipeline, and have approximately 220 PH/s of installed hash power. The new Sherbrooke facility will add another 30 megawatts to their capacity.\nWes Fulford, CEO of Bitfarms, told us:\n\u201cThe LG rate remains one of the most competitive in North America and will allow Bitfarms to continue its expansion in Qu\u00e9bec, particularly Phase 1 and Phase 2 of our new modern computing centre within the municipality of Sherbrooke.\u201d\nA Sustainable Approach to Mining\nOn their website, Bitfarms emphasizes the importance of green, sustainable energy use, saying, \u201cWe prioritize a sustainable approach just as much as a healthy bottom line.\u201d\nBitfarms president Pierre-Luc Quimper was an active participant in government energy hearings held in the summer and fall of 2018 and has been a leader in proposing green energy solutions, including load-shedding agreements during peak consumption periods.\nThe company is also working on a project evaluation grid to determine hydro use and economic spin-offs.\nJonathan Hamel, a Bitcoin technology consultant with the Montreal Economic Institute and founder of Acad\u00e9mie Bitcoin, told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cThe decision of the Quebec Energy Board is a major victory for Bitcoin miners in Quebec but also for Bitcoin in general. It\u2019s a clear demonstration that Bitcoin-related businesses are operating within the scope of the law of the land.\u201d\nHe pointed out that, initially, Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec was in favor of accommodating the demand of large-scale mining operations, but they reversed course when the situation got political.\n\u201cThe former provincial government (defeated in October 2018) imposed a decree forcing the Bitcoin mining industry to accept a 300% rate increase and a potential price auction for future energy block allocation. This ruling is promising because it legitimizes the Bitcoin mining industry on a national scale.\u201d\nReacting to the Hydro Quebec announcement, Francis Pouliot, a Quebec native and Bitcoin entrepreneur, expressed his disappointment with the previous government:\n\nIf Quebec had kept electricity rates low for Bitcoin miners 5 years ago with clear regs/guarantees (it's the now) we'd currently be top 3 Bitcoin producers and perhaps top exporter of bitcoins worldwide.

Overseen by Bitcoin Core lead maintainer Wladimir van der Laan, this latest major release was developed over a span of about six months, by over a hundred contributors.\nBitcoin Core 0.18.0 includes the typical range of performance improvements and bug fixes, as well as some new features.\nHere\u2019s an overview of some of the most significant changes.\nHardware Wallet Compatibility\nOne of the most highly anticipated changes in Bitcoin Core 0.18.0 will be allowing users the ability to connect their hardware wallet (Ledger, Trezor, Digital BitBox, KeepKey and Coldcard) through the Hardware Wallet Interaction (HWI) tool. This combines one of the most secure ways to store your private keys with the most secure way to interact with the blockchain.\nHardware wallets are considered secure because the user\u2019s private keys never leave the device. The keys are never exposed to the internet or the computer to which they\u2019re connected, which makes hardware wallets immune to remote hacking.\nWhile it is already possible to connect a hardware wallet to an Electrum wallet connected to your full node using the Electrum Personal Server, HWI will be the first native, hardware-to-node option as part of the Bitcoin Core project. For now, the HWI scripts are still command line only and a manual process is required to connect the hardware wallet.\nGUI Support for Multiwallet Feature\nAnother advancement from the latest update is giving users the ability to pair with multiple wallets. This builds off of some of the work done in Bitcoin Core 0.17.0, where users were no longer constrained by only creating wallets when starting up their node, and could instead create and use new wallets whenever they like. In Bitcoin Core 0.18.0, users can pair these multiple wallets they\u2019ve created and plug the feature into the Graphical User Interface (GUI).\nThis feature will continue to be refined with later updates, as there are still some known issues in using the GUI to access the \u201cmultiwallet\u201d command. The most notable is that you can\u2019t use coin control features with multiple wallets loaded, or else you will likely retain the wrong wallet when attempting to switch wallets.\nThe coin control function allows the user to control which coins in the wallet to use when you send a transaction. This feature is an important aspect in maintaining user privacy since certain unspent transaction outputs (UTXO) may reveal more than others, either by the address they are sent from or the amount that they are worth. (For example, if you have one UTXO that is worth 1,000 BTC and one that\u2019s worth 0.1 BTC, you may prefer to use the 0.1 UTXO to prevent that the person you pay learns you own at least 1,000 BTC.)\nRefinements to Output Script Descriptors Language\nProposed by Blockstream engineer and Bitcoin Core contributor Pieter Wuille, the output script descriptors language debuted in Bitcoin 0.17.0. The main use of this language is to allow users to name their different types of public and private keys associated with their wallets and make it easier to move these keys from one wallet to another. Per his original proposal document, Wuille\u2019s ultimate goal is to one day \u201cremove the need for importing scripts and keys entirely, and instead make the wallet just be a list of these descriptors and their associated metadata.\u201d\nAs Wuille and other developers continue to work toward growing this list of descriptors, the latest update refines some of the existing language by providing new commands to allow users to begin importing human-readable descriptors for every script for which Bitcoin Core can sign.\nBitcoin Mining Promotes Segregated Witness Adoption\nGetblocktemplate (GBT) was the first attempt at a decentralized, open source, Bitcoin mining pool protocol and was developed by the Bitcoin community in 2012. Some of the pool-specific mining protocols at that time simply issued block headers for a miner to solve, with no knowledge of what was actually in the block, and essentially gave control blindly to the pool operator. Like the much newer BetterHash protocol, GBT decentralized this process by returning power back to the miner (\u201chasher\u201d), by moving block creation (transaction selection) to him.\nIf you are a miner looking to join a supported pool, to begin using the protocol, the miner contacts the pool server and requests an initial template, which will include the rules set down for participation in the pool. These rules are customized by the mining pool and can range from coinbase and nonce parameters to min/max times hashing. But in the latest update, calls to receive this template that don\u2019t enable SegWit will fail and the miner will receive an error message. ((However, a miner calling getblocktemplate without SegWit specified is likely a user error in any case, since this would result in lower rewards for the miner.)\nSegWit, implemented in 2017, is considered the biggest protocol update ever made to the Bitcoin software. The major change resulting from SegWit was fixing the malleability bug and replacing the block size limit with a block \u201cweight\u201d limit, allowing up to 4 megabytes of transaction data, and giving a substantial boost in the transaction capacity of the network.", "year": 2019, "month": 5, "day": 2}

Due to the proximity of Southeast Asia to North Korea, this makes it vulnerable to the nation\u2019s cryptocurrency activity.\n\u201cSince Southeast Asia also features a nascent but burgeoning cryptocurrency industry, local law enforcement agencies will likely require further knowledge and resources to ensure that they can successfully respond to cryptocurrency-related criminal activity over time should the local cryptocurrency industry continue to grow in scale,\u201d the report reads.\nCryptocurrency in Southeast Asia\nSpecifically, the research evaluates Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, with the use of cryptocurrency and the size of its industry varying greatly among them.\nIn Cambodia, for instance, crypto use is believed to be minimal, with the first exchange applying to operate in the region in August 2018. Yet, in Thailand, three cryptocurrency exchanges were granted licenses to operate at the beginning of this year. As the study notes, BX Thailand is the largest crypto exchange, ranking among the 100 largest globally, with a daily trading volume of around $3 million.\nIt is countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, which have cryptocurrency exchanges among the top 200 worldwide when it comes to trading volumes and trade worth over $1 million each day, that could prove particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks from the likes of North Korea.\nNorth Korea\u2019s Use of Crypto\nNorth Korea could cash out its cryptocurrencies at exchanges in these countries, relying on the network of users to do so, the research notes.\n\u201cVietnam, for example, has a cryptocurrency user base of over 1 million individual users,\u201d the report says. \u201cVietnam also ranks among the top five countries globally in terms of the number of online logins to major cryptocurrency exchanges.\u201d\nNorth Korea could also use its overseas financial networks to open accounts at crypto exchanges in Southeast Asia without any links back to it. Over-the-counter trades and peer-to-peer platforms such as LocalBitcoins, Paxful and xCoins \u2014 which the study highlights \u2014 are also vulnerable to exploitation. This is due to the fact that many peer-to-peer platforms don\u2019t require know-your-customer (KYC) or anti-money laundering (AML) information from their users, allowing an increased degree of anonymity.\nHowever, within the last few weeks, Paxful and LocalBitcoins announced that they have introduced AI-powered identity verification to help improve KYC and AML procedures on their platforms.\nCrypto Regulation in Southeast Asia\nJust as the use of cryptocurrency and the size of the crypto industry vary among the countries in Southeast Asia, so do their regulatory approaches.\nMalaysia requires all crypto platforms operating in the country to declare their business to Bank Negara, Malaysia\u2019s central bank, and to adhere to local AML and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) requirements. The State Bank of Vietnam, on the other hand, has banned bitcoin as a payment method. It has also stopped firms from engaging in crypto-related activities.\nBank Indonesia, the central bank of Indonesia, has also banned the use of cryptocurrencies, yet in 2014 Singapore was one of the first countries to regulate its use.\nIn Thailand, crypto is viewed legally as \u201cdigital assets and digital tokens,\u201d according to the country\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Exchanges there are also required to adhere to AML/CTF requirements in order to obtain licenses.\nWhile several countries in Southeast Asia have implemented AML, KYC and CTF procedures, not all have extended the local requirements to cover crypto exchanges. But according to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a French intergovernmental organization, \u201ccountries should use risk assessment exercises to develop appropriate risk-based regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies,\u201d the report states. \u201cWhere designed and implemented successfully, these frameworks can contribute to curbing North Korean proliferation financing risks.\u201d\nIt is only with the appropriate frameworks and regulatory responses in place that countries in Southeast Asia can ensure that North Korean activity is subject to regulatory oversight. As the report states, Southeast Asia\u2019s \u201cuncoordinated approaches to the regulation of cryptocurrencies creates a systemic risk such that its growing cryptocurrency industry may be exploited by North Korea and affiliated networks.\u201d", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 24}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nWall Street Market, the second-largest darknet market in the world in recent months, has been shut down by international law enforcement agencies, including Europol as well as U.S., German, Dutch and Romanian law enforcement. Three suspected operators of the online marketplace for illegal goods and services have been arrested in Germany, while some of the highest-selling suppliers of narcotics were arrested in the United States.\nDarknet markets are the digital black markets only accessible through the anonymizing Tor browser; they use bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for payment. Since the pioneering Silk Road was shutdown in 2013, such markets have only grown in popularity. According to research by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis published in January 2019, darknet market activity almost doubled throughout 2018, surpassing a yearly volume of $600 million. Back in the days of Silk Road, the record yearly volume never topped $200 million, according to Chainalysis.\nOne of Silk Road\u2019s recent successors, Wall Street Market, offered a platform for selling illegal drugs as well as weapons, hacking software and stolen login credentials. According to Europol, over 1,150,000 user accounts were registered on Wall Street Market, and over 63,000 offers had been placed on the website by more than 5,400 seller accounts. This made Wall Street Market the second-most popular darknet market at the time of closure, Europol noted, presumably behind Dream Market.\nThe website was ultimately shutdown by German Federal Criminal Police, under the authority of the German Public Prosecutor\u2019s office, and three suspected operators were arrested. The German police were supported by the Dutch National Police, Europol, Eurojust and various U.S. government agencies including the DEA, FBI, IRS, Homeland Security Investigations, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and the U.S. Department of Justice. German authorities also seized \u20ac550,000 (approximately $615,500 USD) in cash and six-figure amounts worth of bitcoin and XMR (monero), as well as several vehicles and other evidence.\nEuropol\u2019s Executive Director Catherine De Bolle commented in a statement published on the Europol website:\n\u201cThese two investigations show the importance of law enforcement cooperation at an international level and demonstrate that illegal activity on the dark web is not as anonymous as criminals may think.\u201d\nDarknet Disarray\nAs reported by Bitcoin Magazine last week, Wall Street Market had been in a state of turmoil for several weeks. Following a presumed influx of new users from the also-defunct darknet market Dream Market, Wall Street Market operators started pulling an exit scam, reportedly stealing a total of $14 million to $30 million worth of bitcoin and XMR from user accounts. On top of that, some Wall Street Market users were being blackmailed, as one of the website\u2019s moderators threatened to leak identifying information about the users to law enforcement, unless these users paid him 0.05 BTC.\nAs reported by ZDNet, the same moderator went a step further only days later, as he published the IP address and his login credentials to the darknet market on darknet-focused forum Dread. This not only revealed the location of the Wall Street Market server, which was located in the Netherlands, but also allowed anyone access to the website\u2019s administrative section to collect information about users and orders, which reportedly included deanonymizing details like home addresses. It\u2019s likely that this is how law enforcement was able to shut down Wall Street Market and arrest suspects, but this has not been confirmed.\nThe takedown further confirms that the recent \u201cdarknet market era,\u201d with Dream Market and Wall Street Market as market leaders, is coming to and end. Wall Street Market is now officially offline, and Dream Market halted trading weeks ago with its future unclear. While a notice on Dream Market predicted it would shut down on April 30, 2019, the website is still up \u2014 though with trading still disabled. The Dream Market replacement website is not online either, as the onion address in the notice is unresponsive.\nOn top of that, in the same press release, Interpol announced that Finnish authorities shut down yet another darknet market earlier this year. Valhalla, which was previously known under its Finnish name Silkkitie, was one of the oldest darknet markets online, though, according to Finnish customs, the site had been compromised by them since at least 2017. Still, according to Europol, Valhalla had its contents seized by Finnish Customs only this year, in close cooperation with the French National Police.", "year": 2019, "month": 5, "day": 3}

The desktop application is now compatible with Bitcoin\u2019s mainnet and it leverages Neutrino (the protocol, not the analytics company acquired by Coinbase) to give users a lightweight option to \u201ccontrol their own funds,\u201d as opposed to running a full node or trusting a third party to play custodian.\n\u201cThis release required a diverse skill set of protocol engineering, product development and design thinking,\u201d Tankred Hase, a Lightning Labs application developer, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cI\u2019m lucky enough to work with such a talented team at Lightning Labs where we can bring all those perspectives together. I\u2019m hoping this release makes Bitcoin and Lightning more accessible to new types of users.\u201d\nThe release, which Lightning Labs says in a blog post \u201cis still an early version targeted at testers,\u201d is immediately available for macOS, Windows and Linux, while smartphone applications for Android and iOS \u201care coming very soon,\u201d Hase told us.\nHase also said that the Android app is still in development internally and the iOS iteration is \u201cavailable publicly in pre-alpha in TestFlight.\u201d He added that the company needs to \u201cpolish Lightning Network Daemon/Neutrino stability and performance\u201d before the full releases.\nFor the desktop application, v0.5.0-alpha will launch on Bitcoin\u2019s mainnet by default, while prior versions will now allow users to automatically update when they enter testnet (the testnet version will still be available, though it will likely be most useful for developers and engineers in light of this mainnet release).\nThe update has introduced a slew of improvements, according to Lightning Labs. It sports a unified balance to help users keep track of how much bitcoin they have on-chain or in payment channels, with the latter demarcated by a percentage under the aggregate balance. Users will also be able to view how many satoshis are in each channel with the app\u2019s channel page.\nAutopilot \u2014 a feature for the Lightning Network Daemon implementation that makes it easier to connect to nodes to set up channels \u2014 now includes a scoring system to judge which nodes would be most effective at routing payments. This autopilot mechanism is a default feature now, though the application also lets its users manage their node connections and channels manually if they wish.\n\u201cSelecting which node to open a channel to is something we don\u2019t want our users to burden themselves with,\u201d the post reads. \u201cSelecting a set of initial channels is an important part of bootstrapping new users to the Lightning Network, and with this new system, we\u2019ll ensure that our users\u2019 very first channels act as reliable gateways to the Lightning Network.\u201d\nDown the road, Lightning Labs will integrate Lightning Loop to give users the option to top up channel balances or empty them without closing the channels themselves.\nThe above features are notable for user experience and interface improvements, but perhaps the most salient addition in the release is the wallet\u2019s use of Neutrino. As the blog post succinctly spells out, Neutrino, which can be used for on-chain wallets but is especially useful for Lightning, \u201cis a light client specification that allows non-custodial Lightning wallets to verify Bitcoin transactions.\u201d Basically, it allows software clients (applications) to receive compressed blockchain data to verify transactions without having to download the full Bitcoin blockchain, which clocks in at an unwieldy 200 GB. This gives these clients a degree of the same privacy that full nodes enjoy, without sacrificing custody of funds to a third party (the typical trade-off for using a lightweight wallet).\n\u201cWithout Neutrino, a non-custodial solution required using the command line interface, setting up your own Bitcoin + Lightning full node and the configuring of a third-party app to connect remotely to your node,\u201d Hase told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThat process was very technical and required way too many steps for average users. Neutrino allows us to bundle everything up into one app that users can open with a double click.\u201d\nSo if you use Lightning Labs\u2019 wallet, even if you\u2019re not connected to your own node, you have complete custody of your funds.\nThe post concludes by warning users that Lightning is \u201cstill very early technology and there\u2019s a risk of losing all of your funds.\u201d It also calls for the community to help improve the application by reaching out to Lightning Labs and opening up requests on GitHub.\nAs the technology is still risky \u2014 and the Neutrino client is young \u2014 Lightning Labs won\u2019t be resting on its laurels. As Hase told us in our correspondence, there\u2019s still plenty of work to do and much they can learn from this rollout as users begin tinkering.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still the very first release and now is the time to iterate and start learning,\u201d he said.", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 23}

The 10,000 respondents were selected from 10 pools of 1,000 people from each participating nation: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain and the U.K. Questions were posed in each country\u2019s native language, with French being the language used for multilingual Belgium.\nCrypto Confidence Higher Than Bitcoin Confidence\nEuropeans displayed a higher level of confidence in crypto assets as a whole than they did specifically in bitcoin. Only 49 percent of all survey participants indicated a belief that bitcoin will exist in 10 years\u2019 time, while 63 percent indicated that confidence in the crypto space overall. Only 7 percent of respondents indicated a belief that bitcoin will exist as an investment and security tool in 10 years.\nThe variance from nation to nation on these responses did not seem to easily correlate with larger economic factors such as GDP, the human development index or relationships to the European Union. Only Britain and France, for example, displayed less confidence than Belgium did that the crypto space will exist in 10 years, yet Belgium tied for the second-highest confidence that bitcoin will enjoy continued use as an investment tool.\nThere was a difference of 18 percent between the most and least confident nations about the crypto space as a whole, with Norway clocking in as the most optimistic and France as the most skeptical. Of surveyed Italians, 55 percent believed that bitcoin will still exist in 10 years, while only 40 percent of French citizens indicated the same. Confidence in bitcoin\u2019s continued status was relatively dismal across the board, with only 4 percent of the British respondents indicating a belief in its long-term viability.\nSurvey Methodology\nThe methodology of this survey may leave something to be desired. Several charts were constructed to compile the various answers to the survey, but the survey itself only had one question: \u201cDo you think bitcoin will still exist in 10 years\u2019 time?\u201d\nThere were seven different possible answers listed for this question, encompassing a variety of potential futures for the crypto space so, evidently, the answers to the same question were used to compile the result data, rather than distinctly separate questions.\nStill, even the most pessimistic views of the crypto space\u2019s continued existence show nearly half believing in bitcoin\u2019s longevity and more than 60 percent believing in the space. As recent claim that bitcoin\u2019s value is back on the rise, these attitudes may soon become even more favorable.", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 24}

The feature allows users to bundle their wallet balances together, effectively shuffling the coins to obscure sender, receiver and the coins\u2019 point of origin information. Since CoinJoin was enabled in August 2018, the wallet claims that over 28,000 BTC have been made fungible through the process.\nWith its latest release, the wallet is taking its privacy features further still. Alongside user experience improvements \u2014 such as reducing bandwidth requirements 20-fold and increasing loading speed by 12 times \u2014 the wallet now features \u201cLurking Wife Mode.\u201d Whether it\u2019s a wife, husband or some other person loitering behind your screen, the mode censors certain sensitive information so as to not expose it to bystanders.\n\n\nJust a small (and surprisingly useful) UI feature: pic.twitter.com/AzPnCAxWyl\u2014 nopara73 (@nopara73) April 23, 2019\n\n\n\nIt also includes added support for Tor. Before the upgrade, Wasabi used Tor only when members would communicate with a CoinJoin coordinator. Now, \u201ceverything goes through Tor,\u201d the update\u2019s patch notes state, achieving \u201cthe theoretical limit of network level privacy that is possible in cryptocurrencies today.\u201d\nThis version even has your back if you blundered your password upon setting up your wallet. If you let a typo slip into the password you provided when creating your wallet, you now have the opportunity to brute-force the mistake and reclaim control of your wallet with a new password finder.\nThe detail and scope of the wallet\u2019s new features, from privacy-strengthening additions to user experience and interface improvements, are some of the most comprehensive and noteworthy in contemporary desktop wallets, and it\u2019s certainly the most expansive and feature-laden of Wasabi\u2019s updates. And even with all of the previously mentioned upgrades in mind, there\u2019s yet another impressive addition \u2014 the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance: hardware wallet integration.\nWhile notably qualified as an \u201cEXPERIMENTAL\u201d (emphasis: Wasabi\u2019s) feature, the wallet now interoperates with the Coldcard Mark1, Ledger Nano S and Trezor Model T.\n\u201cOther hardware wallets are likely to also work,\u201d the GitHub notes claim, but the team didn\u2019t have access to the specifications to these so they couldn\u2019t test them to confirm.\n\u201cUnfortunately coinjoins are not possible with hardware wallets, so that feature had to be turned off for these kind of wallets. We will work on smoother intra-wallet workflows, like send-to-wallet functionality and multiwallet monitoring,\u201d per the notes.\nThis feature undoubtedly enhances security. Known for their robust protection and reliability, hardware wallets offer perhaps the safest method to store cryptocurrencies, as the private key for a wallet is kept offline in the device itself.

The attacks appeared to exploit a weakness in the anonymizing Tor browser \u2014 needed to access the website \u2014 which made the cost of such an attack relatively low.\nWhile it is not certain who is behind the attacks, the reports, based on comments by pseudonymous Dread forum operator \u201cHugBunter,\u201d suggest that it was part of an extortion effort. The attacker seems to have demanded that the pseudonymous operator of Dream Market, \u201cSpeedstepper,\u201d pay to make the attacks stop.\n\u201cIn one comment about a separate attack against Dread, HugBunter wrote that the entity behind the Dream Market attack had launched the attack in an attempt to extort the Dream Market administrator for 400,000 USD,\u201d Deep Dot Web reports, noting that Speedstepper refused to pay.\nOthers have suggested that law enforcement officials or a competing darknet market may have been responsible for the attacks, but this is just speculation at this point.\nFor the past month, after about seven weeks of ongoing denial of service attacks, trading on Dream Market has been halted altogether. According to Deep Dot Web, quoting a Dream Market staff member, the DDoS attacks had become too big of a problem for the operators of the website.\nUsers who logged into the marketplace were instead greeted with a message claiming that the darknet market is closing:\n\u201cThis market is shutting down on 04/30/2019 and is transferring its services to a partner company, onion address: weroidjkazxqds2l.onion (currently offline, opening soon).\u201d\nBesides the somewhat mysterious message, not much is clear about Dream Market\u2019s future. It\u2019s unknown which partner company the message refers to or to what extent the current version of Dream Market will still be in use. Reports by Deep Dot Web (once again based on comments by Dread forum operator HugBunter) suggest the market may just be rebranding, but details are unclear. Speedstepper has not publicly commented on the issue.\nEven with trading halted, Dream Market users \u2014 while unable to trade on the website or make deposits \u2014 do appear to have been able to withdraw funds from their accounts.\nWall Street Market and the End of an Era?\nWith Dream Market shutting down all trade, users of the platform presumably went looking for replacement darknet markets. Many of them probably ended up at Wall Street Market, one of the biggest darknet markets next to Dream Market.\nBut now, after several weeks, reports on Dread and Deep Dot Web claim that Wall Street Market is \u201cexit scamming\u201d: disappearing with users\u2019 funds. With the inflow of new users from Dream Market, the amount of money stolen is reported to add up to $30 million. Wall Street Market itself claims \u201ctechnical issues\u201d \u2014 at the time of writing, a message on the website shows that it is down for maintenance, but many users are expressing doubts that this is true. One of the website\u2019s administrators is even alleged to have blackmailed users, threatening to leak their identifying information to law enforcement.\nIt\u2019s not the first time that a group of darknet markets has disappeared around the same time. After the pioneering darknet market Silk Road was shut down by law enforcement in 2013, successors Silk Road 2.0, Cloud 9 and Hydra all suffered the same fate in November 2014, as part of an international law enforcement operation called \u201cOperation Onymous.\u201d The void was filled by Agora (which voluntarily shut down in 2015) and later AlphaBay, which in turn grew to be the dominant digital black market throughout 2015 and 2016. By 2017, however, AlphaBay was shut down by law enforcement as well.\nAt that time, many users migrated to Hansa. Hansa, however, turned out to have already been taken over by Dutch police. In what was called \u201cOperation Bayonet,\u201d new users from AlphaBay were trapped into entering passwords and more potentially identifying information in the compromised version of the Hansa website. After several weeks, Hansa was finally closed down as well, meaning the two biggest darknet markets were taken down within a span of several weeks.\nThus far, there is no indication that law enforcement has anything to do with the situation at Dream Market and Wall Street Market. No arrests have been made public, and both websites are technically still online \u2014 though dysfunctional.\nDarknet Growth Over the Years\nAlthough several of the biggest darknet markets have been shut down by law enforcement over the years, it has done little to stop trade on digital black markets overall. According to research by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, published in January 2019, darknet market activity almost doubled throughout 2018. After a slump in late 2017 due to the closure of AlphaBay and Hansa, trading volume had almost recovered to all-time high levels at the time of publication of the report, surpassing $600 million worth of bitcoin for the year.\nWhile bitcoin is still the main currency of choice on most darknet markets, the Chainalysis report does suggest that this type of activity has come to constitute a much smaller share of total bitcoin usage over time. Whereas up to 7 percent of transacted bitcoin value in 2012 and 2013 \u2014 the peak of the Silk Road \u2014 was related to darknet markets, this is now well below 1 percent, Chainalysis estimates.", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 26}

But like any dextrous organism facing extinction, the virus and its propagators are adapting.\nAccording to a report by cybersecurity analytics firm Symantec, cryptojacking incidents have plummeted 52 percent since January 2018, but the method of delivery, the execution and the targeting schemes have grown more sophisticated.\nSpecifically, Symantec\u2019s latest report focused on Beapy, a cryptojacking campaign sweeping through Asia by taking specific aim at business and enterprise. Using a software exploit called EternalBlue, which was developed by the United States\u2019 own NSA, the virus is spread via email. Symantec first tuned into the growing threat in January of this year.\nWith infection rates spiking in March and continuing an exponential upward trajectory since, the firm has concluded that, based on the virus\u2019s infection route, \u201cit was probably always intended to spread throughout enterprise networks.\u201d Described as a \u201cworm\u201d by the report, the virus effectively infiltrated vulnerable devices and, using a matrix of cyber tunnels, bored its way into devices connected to the same server or network.\n\u201cThis campaign demonstrates that while cryptojacking has declined in popularity with cyber criminals since its peak at the start of 2018, it is still a focus for some of them, with enterprises now their primary target,\u201d the introduction to the report asserts.\n\nGraph courtesy of Symantec\nSome 98 percent of infected parties are enterprise related, the report continues, mirroring 2018 trends in ransomware attacks wherein a drop in overall threats corresponded with an increase in enterprise-focused infections. These attacks, Symantec Threat Intelligence Analyst Allan Neville told Bitcoin Magazine, can \u201c[render] some devices unusable due to high CPU usage.\u201d\nChina has become the main target of this particular attack, dwarfing all other affected countries with a staggering 83 percent share of all infections. Other afflicted countries include Japan, Vietnam, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Bangladesh, Philippines and \u2014 the only two outside of the Eastern Hemisphere \u2014 Jamaica and Japan.\nVirus Infection Strategy\nThe virus was initially spread through Windows devices via an infected Excel spreadsheet. Once opened, the spreadsheet would create a backdoor into the computer\u2019s OS, making use of the DoublePulse exploit that was leaked in the same batch of cyber tools that gave the attackers the EternalBlue vector for their operations.\nExploiting a weak point in Windows\u2019 Server Message Block protocol, the files containing the virus could then be spread \u201claterally across networks.\u201d\nThe mining malware also commandeered credentials, such as passwords and usernames, from infected devices to spread to other computers in a network. Moreover, the firm found versions of Beapy on a public-facing web server, using a list of IP addresses connected to this server to create a hit list of potential victims.\nMore Upside Than Before\nOne of the study\u2019s most interesting findings is that Beapy is unlike the run-of-the-mill cryptojacking malware most often employed when infections were at their zenith in early 2018.\nMost of these campaigns employed browser-based miners. These viruses largely leveraged the Coinhive protocol, a non-malicious software implementation that was employed by such sites as UNICEF, allowing its website visitors to voluntarily mine Monero for charity through their browsers upon visiting the site. Coinhive shuttered operations in March of 2019, and this, coupled with Monero\u2019s steep depreciation in the bear market, likely led to a steady decline in cryptojacking, the report surmises.\nBeapy, however, doesn\u2019t rely on browser mining, opting instead for a much more lucrative and complex file mining approach. Unlike browser mining, file mining is more resource efficient and makes for a greater haul: the average 30-day return for this technique, for instance, could net the virus\u2019s blackhats $750,000, making the browser mining alternative\u2019s return seem paltry at $30,000.\n\nImage courtesy of Symantec\nDespite it being on the rise, \u201cfile-based coinmining isn\u2019t new,\u201d Neville told Bitcoin Magazine; it\u2019s just \u201ctaken a back seat to browser-based coinmining the past couple of years\u201d due to the fact that browser-based mining cryptojacking takes less technical skill.\n\u201cThe launch of Coinhive \u2014 with its ready made scripts \u2014 lowered this barrier even further,\u201d he added.\nFurthermore, even if a computer is patched against the virus, they will still execute browser mining if they visit a site \u201cthat has coin-mining code injected into it.\u201d\nNeville clarified that it\u2019s \u201ctoo early to tell if we\u2019ll see a resurgence in file-based mining compared to browser-based mining.\u201d Still, as detection and protection against Coinminers improves, cyber criminals will look toward \u201calternative revenue sources.\u201d\n\u201cAs cyber criminals hone their tactics, we\u2019ve also seen that their approach becomes more targeted.\u201d\nDefending Against the Threat\nThe report ends by listing the side effects of such cryptojacking infections, including device overheating and excessive battery consumption, which can lead to device degradation and spikes in electricity costs.\nIt also details the precautions that companies can take to insulate against such attacks. On the hardware and software side, companies can employ security solutions \u201cto guard against single-point failures in any specific technology or protection method,\u201d including firewalls and vulnerability assessments; robust passwords and multi-factor authentication are also a bonus.\nOn the employee side, education is key. In addition to basic cyber hygiene, the report prescribes lessons on what cryptojacking is and how to spot it, like watching for spikes in CPU usage and a battery drain. Neville reiterated many of these points at the end of our correspondence.\n\u201cBeyond ensuring that employees receive regular training to recognize and report phishing emails used to deliver malware, businesses should implement overlapping and mutually supportive defensive systems to guard against single-point failures in any specific technology or protection method. This includes deployment of endpoint, email and web gateway protection technologies, as well as firewalls and vulnerability assessment solutions. It\u2019s also crucial to keep these security solutions up to date with the latest protections and ensure systems are protected against exploits such as EternalBlue.", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 26}
{"title": "Bitfinex Faces Legal Action From NY Attorney General: Here\u2019s What This Means", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitfinex-faces-legal-action-from-ny-attorney-general-heres-what-this-means/", "birthday": "Apr 26, 2019  6:12 PM EST", "date": "2019-04-26 23:12:00", "content": "\nThe New York Office of the Attorney General (AG) wants to take a closer look into the business operations of Bitfinex and related stablecoin issuer Tether (USDT). According to a legal petition filed with the Supreme Court of New York, the NY Attorney General Office of Letitia James is applying for a court order to investigate Bitfinex\u2019s suite of interrelated companies (including its umbrella firm iFinex and Tether Holdings Limited) for \u201congoing fraud\u201d to the tune of $850 million.\nWhat does the news mean for Bitfinex, Tether and Bitcoin?\nWhat Is the Legal Action About Exactly?\nPrompted by its findings in a 2018 investigative subpoena, the New York Office of the Attorney General alleges that Bitfinex used funds from Tether (a separate company run by the same management) to mask some $850 million in losses in customer funds resulting from potential theft or mismanagement by payment processor Crypto Capital.\nBitfinex ended up relying on the fiduciary services of the Panama-based payment processor following a roulette of troubled banking relationships throughout the years. By mid-2018, Crypto Capital held roughly $1 billion worth of combined business and customer funds on behalf of Bitfinex. The document alleges that Bitfinex entrusted Crypto Capital with these funds without signing a contract or business agreement.\nText-based correspondence cited in the document from mid-2018, which was obtained during the AG\u2019s 2018 investigation, reveal a Bitfinex employee\u2019s persistent yet unsuccessful attempts to retrieve funds from Crypto Capital. The payment processor claimed that the funds were seized by Portuguese, Polish and American authorities, though both the Attorney General and Bitfinex question whether this is true.\nIn the meantime, complaints of delayed withdrawals from Bitfinex users were rampant. The court document states that despite its issues with Crypto Capital, Bitfinex falsely claimed that cash withdrawals were unobstructed during this period.\nIn order to be able to continue processing withdrawals, Bitfinex ultimately transferred $625 million from Tether\u2019s reserves. Additionally, Bitfinex established a $900 million \u201crevolving line of credit\u201d with Tether, and both this promise of credit and the prior transfer were conducted without Bitfinex or Tether alerting its users.\nThis line of credit, which Bitfinex can draw from on a need-by-need basis, is collateralized with over 60 million shares of iFinex Inc., one of the Bitfinex brand\u2019s shell companies. These shares are owned by DigFinex, the majority owner of both Tether and iFinex.\n\u201cThat transaction closed on or about March 19. 20I9. The total accessed under the loan facility as of today\u2019s date is equal to $700 million,\u201d the document states.\nThis fund shuffling and the capital mismanagement that prompted it are the crux of the legal proceedings, with the letter stating that Bitfinex has \u201cproduced only limited relevant information\u201d regarding Tether\u2019s $625 million transfer and $900 million line of credit.\nIn conclusion, the letter reads, \u201cOAG\u2019s ongoing investigation seeks to determine, among other things, the extent to which New York investors are exposed to ongoing fraud being carried out by Bitfinex and Tether.\u201d To make this determination, the application seeks a court order to secure relevant business and financial information, including tax documentation, an official audit, and banking/loan documents and correspondence.\nWhy Is This Legal Pressure Coming Out of New York?\nBitfinex nor Tether are based in New York. Neither company possesses a BitLicense needed to operate a cryptocurrency exchange in the state, so Bitfinex officially barred its service to individuals from New York in August 2017 and to businesses in August 2018.\nHowever, the New York Attorney General believes that the exchange was still serving (some) New York citizens regardless, and the order explicitly states that it seeks to protect \u201clegitimate traders using the Bitfinex platform ... primarily those residing in New York.\u201d\nThe New York Attorney General can also invoke what is known as the Martin Act. As securities regulatory attorney Scott Andersen said on Twitter, the Act \u201cbroadly empowers the NY Attorney General to conduct civil and criminal investigations for securities law violations.\u201d With this regulatory power, the AG can obtain a preliminary court order to elicit testimony and evidence from Bitfinex.\nWhat Does Bitfinex Say?\nIn a response published on the company\u2019s blog, Bitfinex positions itself as a company that is a good corporate citizen and strong supporter of law enforcement, and it condemns the legal action by the New York Attorney General\u2019s Office as \u201cgross overreach.\u201d\nThe statement reads:\n\u201cThe New York Attorney General\u2019s court filings were written in bad faith and are riddled with false assertions, including as to a purported $850 million \u2018loss\u2019 at Crypto Capital. On the contrary, we have been informed that these Crypto Capital amounts are not lost but have been, in fact, seized and safeguarded. We are and have been actively working to exercise our rights and remedies and get those funds released. Sadly, the New York Attorney General\u2019s office seems to be intent on undermining those efforts to the detriment of our customers.\u201d\nBitfinex further suggests that the New York Attorney General\u2019s time would be better spent trying to aid and support the company\u2019s recovery efforts to procure the funds held by Crypto Capital.\nIs Tether Insolvent? Is Bitfinex?\nNobody can know for sure \u2014 for either company. The request for a court order, in part, hinges on this question, however, and the New York Attorney General seems to believe that Bitfinex siphoned funds from Tether\u2019s reserves to cover up a potential insolvency.\nThe document stakes no claim on whether or not Crypto Capital has the funds. It\u2019s possible that the payment processor might have the money but is refusing to give it up, just as it\u2019s possible that they no longer hold these funds in their own accounts or that they were seized or frozen by authorities.\nIt should be noted that even if $850 million is inaccessible, this represents only a fraction of Bitfinex and Tether\u2019s total holdings. Twitter reports suggest that Bitfinex withdrawals are still being processed.\nWere Bitfinex/Tether Critics Right?\nIt depends on which critics and the timing of their criticisms. Over the years, a wide range of accusations have been leveraged against Bitfinex and Tether.\nOne of the best-known and severe of these accusations was that Tether was creating unbacked USDT \u201cout of thin air,\u201d which it used to artificially inflate the bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets. Some of these accusations go back as far as early 2017. Based on the information that is now available, these accusations appear to be false or at least unproven, and the New York Attorney General\u2019s Office doesn\u2019t lend them credence in its letter.\nMore mild accusations focused on the untransparent business practices of Bitfinex and suspicions that the exchange, with the help of USDT, was running a fractional reserve in some way or another. Seemingly corroborating these suspicions for skeptics, Tether updated its website in March to clarify that USDT is \u201c100% backed by [its] reserves,\u201d which could include \u201ccash equivalents\u201d but also \u201cother assets and receivables from loans.\u201d The old version assured users that each USDT was backed 1-1 with cash. Tether made this change shortly before the $900 million line of credit was established.\nIt appears that from the moment when Bitfinex started running into trouble with Crypto Capital, sometime in 2018, these accusations of fractional reserve practices carried validity.\nWhat Does This Mean for Bitcoin?\nWhile only time will tell, of course, there is little reason to believe these latest developments will have great impact on Bitcoin one way or the other.\nMany bitcoin exchanges have historically had trouble finding reliable banking partners, and some of them have even had to shut down because of this. As we\u2019ve seen with the QuadrigaCX debacle, when an exchange can\u2019t secure proper banking partnerships, it might turn to unscrupulous payment processors--to the detriment of both its operations and its customer\u2019s funds.\nSimilarly, a number of bitcoin exchanges have lost funds due to hacks or otherwise, and in some cases had to entirely close shop because of this as well. While such events have affected the bitcoin price and general sentiment in the short term, it\u2019s not clear if this will result in long-term effects; in this case, it\u2019s far from certain that Bitfinex will have to cease operations or accept losses at all. The company itself certainly doesn\u2019t think so.\nSo far the bitcoin price has seen a somewhat modest price drop of about 5 percent. Interestingly, even USDT is trading at $0.97 on Kraken, suggesting that the market still has relative faith in the stablecoin and the company behind it (for now).", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 26}

With summertime heat waves pushing temperatures above a whopping 127 degrees Fahrenheit, ways of circumventing these measures are becoming an especially important consideration as energy costs continue to increase.\nWhen Bitcoin Magazine helped to pass the Lightning Torch (via Welsh bitcoiner Bitgeiniog) to an Iranian user in March, sanctions were a recurring point of concern, with Torch recipient Ziya Sadr calling bitcoin \u201ca safe haven.\u201d\nApril 2019 has seen Iran become a major area of interest for bitcoin miners from China.

United States Attorney General William Barr claimed in late March that the investigation found no evidence of such collusion, and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) released a redacted version of the full report on April 18, 2019.\nWithin the mammoth write-up, a small section details bitcoin\u2019s role in bankrolling the Russian government\u2019s cyberwarfare endeavors.\n\u201c... cyber intrusions (hacking) and releases of hacked materials [were] damaging to the Clinton Campaign,\u201d the report reads on its fourth page. \u201cThe Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations.\u201d\nTwo military units of the GRU, the report continues some 30 pages later, hacked into computer hardware belonging to Clinton\u2019s campaign, the Democartic National Committee (DNC) and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), leading to email leaks that revealed the DNC gave Clinton preferential treatment during the 2016 Democratic primaries.\nA subunit of one of these two subdivisions ran \u201ca bitcoin mining operation to secure bitcoins used to purchase computer infrastructure used in hacking operations,\u201d the report states. Others ran \u201cspearphishing campaigns\u201d or developed specified malware to gain access to DNC hardware and data.\nAccording to the report, this IT unit stored these bitcoin on the U.K.-based CEX.io, a cryptocurrency cloud mining service and exchange.

This shadow economy, in effect, allows these regimes to fund illicit activities without immediately alerting international governments, precisely the role bitcoin filled for Russia during its interference in the 2016 election.

The idea is that you can devise a decentralized governance system using the blockchain's cryptographic controls \u2014 rule of code, so to speak. Using tokenomics and technical schemes, the DAO affects certain laws over its participants, incentivizes them to play by the rules and encourages the community to hold itself accountable.\nDan Larimer's BitShares, with its delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, was the first DAO, followed by Dash. Since these trailblazers went live, DAO endeavors have become dominated by the Ethereum ecosystem, including, most notably, the eponymous and disastrous The DAO \u2014 best known for forfeiting millions in ether to the void after an incompetent coder unwittingly deleted a wallet library \u2014 and Maker, among others.\nPerhaps because of Bitcoin\u2019s limited scripting language and, conversely, Ethereum\u2019s rich scripting language, Ethereum has been the frontrunner for popular DAOs in recent memory, while one has never launched on the Bitcoin blockchain.\nUntil now, that is.\nBisq Gets an Upgrade\nBisq, one of the Bitcoin community\u2019s only truly decentralized exchanges, introduced version 1.0 of its software this week. Along with other ancillary upgrades, the release dropped a bombshell by furnishing Bitcoin with its first DAO.\n\u201cBisq's DAO, launched on Monday, April 15, is (to my knowledge) the only attempt of its kind to decentralize a project's management and funding to the extent it does,\u201d Steve Jain, a Bisq contributor, told Bitcoin Magazine.\nWith its intention to migrate toward distributed governance, Bisq will strive for an even greater degree of decentralization than it already features. Its software operates on Tor, and each user must run their own separate instance of the program (akin to running a node on a much smaller scale) to access the exchange, making it completely peer-to-peer.\nThe privacy-minded exchange offers a rare, KYC-resistant fiat ramp for bitcoin trading, allowing users to facilitate fiat exchange with payment apps, bank wires and even hard cash swaps, like LocalBitcoins offers. With each trade, bitcoin is locked away in multi-signature contracts, requiring arbitrators to resolve any conflicts should a dispute arise in a trade.\nJain said that this version upgrade was a long time coming.\n\u201cThe DAO was intended to be a part of Bisq from the day it was first conceived in 2014,\u201d he revealed, adding that this launch has been in the works for five years \u2014 meaning that its development predates even the infamous Ethereum DAO. Now that it\u2019s live, he believes that the program has realized an even truer version of itself, one that separates it from the pack.\n\u201cFrom this standpoint, Bisq is a totally different beast \u2014in terms of software and governance \u2014 than any other exchange,\u201d he claimed.\nHow the DAO Works\nBisq\u2019s governance will revolve around a token, but speculators need not apply \u2014 the project isn\u2019t launching an ICO. Instead, each BSQ token will be minted through a process known as coloring.\nColored coins, so-called because they are distinguished from regular coins on the blockchain, are simply satoshis marked for a specific use case. To create tokens for Bisq, for example, users submit satoshis to the DAO, which are then \u201cpainted over\u201d to represent BSQ. These tokens give users the ability to participate in the Bisq DAO.\nThis participation can take many forms. For traders on the platform, BSQ will give them trading discounts, not unlike BNB coin for Binance users, but this token\u2019s use case is more dynamic than that. Contributors, for instance, can submit a compensation request to the network for payment in BSQ after finishing a project for the DAO. The community then votes on whether or not compensation should be awarded, and the developer submits satoshis to mint the colored BSQ tokens.\nMore than just developers, DAO contributors could be designers, support staff, social media managers or writers. These contributors can also stake BSQ in a bond to fill a high-trust position in the DAO, like a back end engineer, copywriter or social media representative. If these de facto employees are caught slacking off or acting up, the community can confiscate their stakes as punishment.\n\u201cIt's a dynamic system of stakeholders acting in their own best interests \u2026 And notably, there are no gatekeepers to manage it all,\u201d Jain said. \u201cBSQ is bought on the open market, and it's issued by collective stakeholder voting. Personal vendettas, bank tantrums, government policies, company rules \u2026 none of these things can get in the way of someone doing work and getting paid for it.\u201d\nTo start, 3,657,480 BSQ has been minted to compensate a team of more than 200 contributors for their five years of labor to get Bisq and its nascent DAO up and running. Going forward, Jain told us that new BSQ will be put into circulation every month to fulfill compensation requests. Any BSQ used for trading fees, on the other hand, will be burned and taken out of supply entirely.\nShould I Trust the Government?\nFor some, the DAO\u2019s attempt to realize cohesive-yet-anarchic governance is utopian at best and foolhardy at worst. Critics point to Ethereum\u2019s DAO and the ensuing hard fork as a bailout of sorts \u2014 the crypto equivalent of the windfalls Washington bestowed on Wall Street during the Great Recession.\nOther criticisms point to the notion that incentives aren\u2019t powerful enough to keep bad actors in line, or that governance systems, depending on structure, give these bad actors mechanisms to game the system and circumvent checks and balances.\nBisq\u2019s own governance is twofold. Voter clout is determined on a weighted basis (how many BSQ tokens you own) and on merit (your reputation on the network). Voting based on token count is a red flag for many \u2014 it\u2019s one of the reasons people look at EOS\u2019 block producer elections as a pay-for-play playground, for instance. When asked if he felt that a stake-based voting model might enable vote buying and give the 1 percent an opportunity to out-influence the other 99, Jain noted optimism around the intentions of stakeholders.\n\u201c[To vote you must] allot a certain amount of the BSQ you own for your voting weight,\u201d he said. \u201cYou must own this BSQ, and yes, you can buy as much of it as you want on the open market. We think that's fair. Presumably, assuming no bad intentions, someone with a lot of money who really believes in the Bisq network may want to buy a lot of BSQ to have a big influence in its decisions.\u201d\nHe continued to qualify that merit \u201cis worth more than pure stake weight.\u201d Basically, someone who contributes to the network has more of a say in voting than someone who bought their tokens; if I earn 10,000 BSQ tokens, for example, even if I sell them, my vote holds more clout than someone who bought 10,000 BSQ on the market. Merit will decay on an annual basis, as well, meaning contributors have to keep working on the ecosystem to maintain or bolster their reputations.\n\u201cLastly, the merits \u2018stack,\u2019 so if I have 10,000 BSQ of merit and 5,000 BSQ in my BSQ wallet, I can stake 5,000 BSQ for a combined voting weight of 15,000 BSQ,\u201d Jain said.\nWith this governance structure in place, Jain emphasized that one of the most significant \u2014 and exciting \u2014 differences with this version upgrade is that contributors can finally get paid for their work. This work, he continued, includes \u201cgrowing liquidity, expanding to new markets and finally integrating SegWit.\u201d Lightning Network integration is a bit further off, though, as it doesn\u2019t fit well into Bisq\u2019s complex architecture.\nEven as the DAO is launched and Bisq has achieved a greater degree of decentralization than before, Jain said that Bisq\u2019s community is \u201cfocused on further decentralizing the network.\u201d This means a new trading scheme which removes arbitrators from the multisignature process and replaces them with mediators \u201cfor a more private, quick and decentralized trading experience where less trust is required.\u201d\nUltimately, he concluded, the idea and final goal is that \u201cusers shouldn\u2019t have to trust Bisq for anything.\u201d", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 18}

Weak hands were shaken out in November of 2018, it says, and this capitulation has laid the groundwork for the next market cycle.\nAs such, its underlying thesis is that bitcoin has entered the accumulation phase of the bear market \u2014 the first stage of a bull market when forward-thinking investors begin loading up in preparation for the next run.\nHow Do They Know?\nAs the disclosure in the report cautions, Adamant Capital is not an oracle and its research isn\u2019t a crystal ball, so it should go without saying that neither the firm nor anyone else knows for sure what bitcoin will do tomorrow or the next day or a year from now. That said, the firm lays out a convincing argument that we\u2019ve experienced the worst of this bear market\u2019s carnage.\nIn fact, it believes that overall sentiment has morphed from despair to hope. To support this claim, Adamant plotted bitcoin\u2019s booms and busts using unrealized profits and unrealized losses. This metric is derived by taking the value of each bitcoin when it last moved (presumably, when each was purchased/changed hands), aggregating all of these into what is called \u201crealized capitalization\u201d and then subtracting it from bitcoin\u2019s actual market capitalization; this gives you unrealized profits/losses.\nAccording to the report, November 2018\u2019s sell-off tanked both portfolios and investor confidence in what could reasonably be considered market capitulation.\n\u201cUnrealized losses doubled in mere weeks\u201d from this episode, causing \u201cexpectations of a swift market recovery [to be] torpedoed by the market,\u201d according to the report. Essentially, with the market shedding 48 percent of its value in one month, people high on \u201chopium\u201d became drunk on despair, signaling capitulation.\nWe can see the effects of this in Google Trends, the report suggests, as searches for \u201cbuying bitcoin\u201d dipped lower than the same queries did in March 2017. Toxic sentiments pervaded crypto social media, as well. The optimism and bullish vibes that led many to believe $6,000 was a firm bottom \u2014 and, on the converse, those who took these good spirits as a sign that the bottom had yet to drop out \u2014 morphed into pessimism, bearish despondency and even hostility (Adamant and its founders received a lot of hate mail during this time, the report claims).\nProof Is in the Blockchain\nTo further support its analysis, the report details how the November capitulation altered the landscape of long- and short-term holders.\nDuring the beginning of 2018, many bitcoin holders clung to their assets because of the disposition effect \u2014 the tendency for investors to hold on to an asset that has lost value in hopes of selling it at a higher price.\nNovember\u2019s price drop shook out many of these holders. Between November 14 and 16, 2018, the market saw more old bitcoin flood its sell walls than on February 23 of the same year. This finding is similar to the unspent transaction analysis Delphi Digital published in January 2019, which likewise claims that bitcoin is in an accumulation phase (and calling for a bottom in Q1 of 2019).\nWith its analysis, Adamant believes that the situation \u201cvisibly improved by the start of 2019\u201d and more investors have begun holding again. On April 1, for example, CME Group\u2019s bitcoin futures saw a significant uptick in longs.\nThe report continues to buttress these findings by drawing comparisons to previous bitcoin market cycles. While previous performance is not indicative of future performance, it admits, Adamant also writes that \u201cthe parallel with previous cycles is sufficient to validate [the] thesis that we are back in undervalued territory.\u201d\nOne final way it can validate this thesis: volatility. At the time of the report, bitcoin\u2019s 60-day volatility was below 5 percent, something it hasn\u2019t seen since 2016. This corroborates Adamant\u2019s hypothesis that retail investors have largely left the market, meaning \u201cagnostic traders and long-term value investors\u201d are sticking around to buy up their bags.\nWhen Moon?\nThe report makes it clear that this analysis doesn\u2019t mean bitcoin can\u2019t drop to November lows \u2014 or even lower still. It reasonably expects the cryptocurrency to trade between $3,000 and $6,500 until the accumulation phase graduates to the next bullish run-up.\nA few factors could drive prices lower, it states, such as exchange hacks like the one Mt. Gox suffered, which partly fueled the 2013 to 2014 sell-offs (though admittedly, it goes on, exchange volume and market share are more evenly distributed now than they were back then). Macroeconomic downturns could also affect prices, though Adamant also believes that in the long run, bitcoin will prove itself as a safe haven for value akin to gold and other hedges. Other potential risks include miner capitulation (though this is mitigated by difficulty adjustments), regulatory threats, litigation like the ongoing Mt. Gox civil rehabilitation and hard fork contentions.\nThe report doesn\u2019t take a crack at guessing when the next bull market will take off. But it does give some more indicators as to how to spot a proper accumulation phase, such as the higher lows in price that are caused by weak hands selling during rallies (keeping price semi-subdued) and strong hands buying these supplies and the dips they cause (keeping price from tanking further).\nIt also ends with fundamental analysis of technical innovations justifying a higher value proposition. The Lightning Network continues to grow up to 45 percent monthly, sidechains have become an increasingly viable scaling solution and mining chips are becoming more efficient, it notes. On the institutional side, futures products and platforms like Bakkt are proliferating, and institutional custody has seen rising interest with newcomers like Fidelity.\nLastly, the report cites millennials as potential significant drivers of adoption. Born into a debt-addled economic landscape and coming to financial literacy during the 2008 Great Recession, millennials\u2019 mistrust of bankers and governments make them ripe to be Bitcoin\u2019s greatest proponents. In fact, we\u2019re already seeing this, the report notes, as a 2013 survey indicates that Bitcoin\u2019s earliest adopters and whales are mostly millennials.\nWith all of this in mind, the report ends on a high note and does make a bit of a prediction.\n\u201cSupported by over 10 years of infrastructure development, we believe the stage is set for mass market adoption in the coming 5 years,\u201d the report concludes. \u201cIn our assessment, during this phase (its \u2018Windows Moment\u2019) Bitcoin will become widely recognized as a portfolio hedging instrument and reserve asset, and will begin making significant inroads as a payment network.\u201d", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 19}

Gox account was verified when it was still operating.\nAccording to a Reddit post from user DerEwige on April 22, 2019, Nobuaki Kobayashi, a Japanese attorney and trustee of the ongoing case, has alerted former Mt. Gox users who didn\u2019t voluntarily apply for reimbursement that they will also receive compensation for their lost bitcoin as rehabilitation takes effect. The exchange is using KYC information that was originally submitted to verify accounts to register users who haven\u2019t directly applied for rehabilitation.\nHandling more than half of all bitcoin transactions at the time of its closure, the Japanese exchange suspended trades and declared bankruptcy in 2014 following an alleged hack.

The legal move provided more leeway for how creditors could be reimbursed. Two months after the shift, private individuals were allowed to begin filing claims for reimbursement and this same filing system was opened up to corporate clients that September.\nIn Kobayashi\u2019s latest email to those who had assets stored on Mt.

DerEwige claimed that he fell into this category, as his sum of bitcoin stored in Mt.

His company is the first in Canada to partner with a government municipality.\nAndrei Poliakov is the CEO and co-founder of Coinberry, one of Canada\u2019s premier digital currency platforms. His company is the first in Canada to partner with a government municipality.\nI am an engineer by trade. Creating more efficient processes, products and eventually building businesses has been a passion of mine since I can remember. When I got involved with blockchain technology, I realized right away the potential benefits the application of this new technology could have on the financial industry.\nBut this was several years ago, when people would think you were a little crazy if you brought up Bitcoin at an event or a party. So I got down to building a business, a team and tech that would bring about mass adoption of blockchain technology and, more specifically, the application of blockchain technology to finances in the form of cryptocurrencies.\nAnd finally, it\u2019s happening all around you. Right now, at this very moment. Most people miss it, but what we\u2019re seeing in early 2019 is the birth of cryptocurrency mass adoption and it\u2019s affecting governments in a positive way.\nWhile a lot of people are asking themselves, \u201cIs this really the next bull run?\u201d or \u201cAre we really going to see Facebook or \u2018XYZ\u2019 social network launch a cryptocurrency?\u201d governments are starting to implement technology to facilitate cryptocurrency transactions today.\nReal change is happening, at a governmental level, that will pave the way towards mass adoption.\nThe Wave Is Rising\nIn early March 2019, Coinberry provided the technology, infrastructure and implementation for the town of Innisfil, a government municipality in Canada, to start accepting tax payments in bitcoin.\nThis was a huge win for the industry.\nWhile the municipality is small, the innovation from the government and the willingness for a government agency to accept cryptocurrency is a giant leap forward. It is the first government partnership of its kind in Canada.\nWhile this partnership is just a start, it is one of the first changes that will unleash additional government adoption moving forward.\nOther government municipalities have started asking us about the implementation, wanting to know more about how, why and what it would take to offer similar services to their residents.\nWhy are they now, all of a sudden, so interested in blockchain technology? What does this mean for governments moving forward? To get a clear picture of what\u2019s coming, we\u2019ve got to look at the underlying motivation of municipalities from a government funding perspective.\nMoney, Motivation and Government Funding\nRegardless of where you stand on the issue of government spending, all governments need money to pay for things like roads, schools, police, fire, hospitals and the like. At present, most governments have very limited options when it comes to making this happen.\nThey can raise money by increasing taxes, issuing bonds or by printing more money. The latter option is only available to federal governments.\nOne additional option, that was not fully available until cryptocurrency arrived, is to cut transaction costs by using more efficient financial technology.\nThis last solution is the low-hanging fruit that governments, like Innisfil\u2019s, are focused on and is a trend that is poised to spread quickly through small and large municipalities alike.\nTrend One: Increasing Funds Without Increasing Taxes\nGovernments are starting to realize that cryptocurrency provides a safe, easy way to reduce transaction costs. This is not a hypothetical scenario anymore: This is a reality. With relatively little effort, a municipality can have more funds without increasing taxes, issuing a bond or implementing budget cuts. This idea has led to an increase in the number of municipalities that are interested in cryptocurrency, both as a form of tax payment and, eventually, as a means to facilitate government transactions: think payroll, contractors and municipal investments.\nTake bank fees as an example.\nOur involvement with another municipality began when it approached us with a challenge. It was paying in the neighborhood of $5 million annually in bank fees when it came to processing payments and it wanted to reduce this cost.\nSaving a percentage of transaction fees \u2014 in this case on an annual basis \u2014 could result in hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars saved.\nImagine a 5 percent savings in transaction costs on the $5 million paid in fees annually. That\u2019s $2.5 million in transaction costs saved over 10 years. While this isn\u2019t necessarily a large number in and of itself, I wouldn\u2019t dismiss it, especially when those savings can be obtained with minimal cost and effort.\nReducing transactions costs on tax payments alone, simply by utilizing a more efficient technology, frees up money that the government is able to regain without having to affect you, the citizen.\nMore governments will realize this and look to implement similar technology in their own regions. Which brings us to the next trend.\nTrend Two: Adaptation of Municipal Law\nTake the tax example above. Let\u2019s say that \u201cMunicipality A\u201d collects $500 million in tax revenue. To put this in perspective, Toronto \u2014 one of the largest cities in the world \u2014 collects over $11 billion dollars per year on average through various revenue streams.\nAt the moment, if a municipality starts collecting 10 percent of the above $500 million in revenue in cryptocurrency \u2014 or $50 million in this case \u2014 it would need to immediately convert that to fiat currency. Why? Because some cryptocurrencies are securities and while the law varies depending on the region, most municipalities are not allowed to invest in securities at the moment and have very limited options when it comes to assets that they are allowed to invest in.\nAs such, the $50 million in cryptocurrency would need to be immediately converted to fiat currency.\nBut what happens if a government contractor, a construction company who has won the next bid to fix the local roads for $10 million, says, \u201cIf you pay in cryptocurrency, we\u2019ll give you a 10 percent discount. We\u2019ll all save on transaction costs and, to be honest, to do this job we need to purchase equipment overseas. We\u2019d rather pay for that equipment in cryptocurrency and save on transaction fees along the way as well.\u201d\nThat 10 percent discount could amount to an additional $1 million in the government\u2019s coffers. Perhaps it could put that toward building that recreation center it\u2019s been promising to build every time elections comes around.\nOr what happens when municipal employees start asking for payment in cryptocurrency? Or governments realize that they can save transaction costs in other areas of operations?\nAs governments start to accumulate cryptocurrency via tax revenue, expect to see a slow build in pressure to shift municipal law toward allowing municipalities to hold and transact in cryptocurrency.\nTrend Three: Raising Funds\nThe third trend that we\u2019re going to start seeing relates to raising money through bonds. If you\u2019re a government and you need to raise money for a new street, for a new community center, to fix potholes or to pay for the police and fire department, you essentially have three primary ways to raise the necessary capital. Only two are applicable at the municipal level.\nOption 1: You can reshape the allocation of current tax revenue (budget cuts) or increase taxes on property, business or individuals.\nOption 2: You can print more money, driving inflation, lowering purchasing power and affecting economic growth. This is only an option at the federal level and does not apply to municipalities.\nOption 3: You can sell bonds \u2014 promissory notes that allow companies and individuals to invest in your government. Government bonds typically come with both a very low rate of return but also come with a very low default risk.\nWhile other, smaller options may be available, we\u2019ll stick to these primary methods for now.\nIt\u2019s no secret that all governments need money. Everyone is running on deficit, using money allocations from federal, state or provincial governments. Raising capital through bond issuance via cryptocurrency is going to be the next immediate trend that governments start to leverage.\nHere\u2019s why:\nCryptocurrency bond issuance can reduce transaction costs on the issuance itself \u2014 saving hundreds of thousands, or millions, of dollars in the process.Governments will be able to tap into much larger markets, opening up to easier and cheaper foreign investments.Governments will be able to provide liquidity for their bond offerings, encouraging investors to invest into their bonds.\nWith government bond tokenization, many benefits start to unfold that allow for a more efficient marketplace. In the very near future, within 12 months or so, I would expect to see government bond issuance via cryptocurrency.\nIt Comes Down to Ease\nNo one is going to deny that blockchains and cryptocurrencies are difficult concepts to grasp. They\u2019re quite complex in general, and the technology and development are conducted by experts in the field.\nBut just as you don\u2019t need to understand how H.264 encoding works to watch the latest high-definition movie trailer on YouTube, understanding the intricacies of blockchain technologies is not necessary for leveraging the applications that run on them. Ultimately, it all comes down to ease of use.\nIn summary, expect to see more governments adopting blockchain technology to reduce costs, municipal laws to shift favorably toward cryptocurrencies and for governments to start looking at raising capital on blockchains. We\u2019re already seeing larger municipalities like Richmond Hill explore the possibility of using cryptocurrency for tax remittance as well.\nIt\u2019s happening all around you. Right now, at this very moment. The wave is rising and the birth of mass adoption is happening.\nThis is a guest post by Andrei Poliakov, CEO and co-founder of Coinberry.

Its goal is to bridge the communication gap between the Chinese community and the outside world. News, policy analysis... everything you want to know about crypto in China is here. \nThe recent bitcoin rally has driven bitcoin mining profits. Profits earned from bitcoin mining have seen a clear rise since the start of April 2019 and hit a near half-a-year high on April 15, 2019.\n\nSource: BCtrend\nAccording to crypto analyst Alex Kruger, the breakeven cost for efficient bitcoin mining operations currently hovers around $3,550 to $4,350, while the price of bitcoin is in the $5,500-plus range at the time of this writing. That ensures a $1,000-plus profit for each bitcoin mined and a substantial profit for bitcoin miners considering the uptick momentum in bitcoin price continues.\nKruger said that the breakeven cost was calculated based on an electricity rate of 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh). While electricity costs vary in different regions, the breakeven cost could vary in line with that.\n\u201c[The] exact number is heavily dependent on electricity cost,\u201d Kruger said. \u201cE.g., last December Coingeek reported an electricity cost (inclusive of all operational expenses) of $0.073. I am using $0.055.\u201d\nGiven that the electricity rate in China is much lower \u2014 3.5 cents kWh as some mining farms have claimed \u2014 when the wet season in Sichuan started, miners in China can make more than $2,000 in profit for each bitcoin mined. Over the second half of 2018, however, the breakeven cost dropped below the BTC price, leading to inefficient bitcoin mining and losses, with some miners even shutting down their operations and selling off their hardware.\n\n\nTogether with the rise of mining profitability, the hashrate of the whole Bitcoin network has also been climbing. That means more miners have been coming back or freshly entering the market. As BTC.com shows, Bitcoin hash power has seen a 25 percent increase, from 36.55 Exa hashes per second (Eh/s) in mid-December 2018, to 45.76 Eh/s in mid-April 2018.\n\n\nThe ASIC miner market has also been waking up, rolling out faster, new-gen mining devices. In late March, Canaan rolled out its Avalonminer 10 which delivers a hashrate of 31 terahashes per second (TH/s) at 1,736 watts (W). Days later, Bitmain revealed its Antminer 17 series, delivering a hashrate ranging from 50 TH/s to 56 TH/s, operating at 42 watts per terahash (W/Th) to 45 W/Th. And MicroBT released a whopping 72 TH/s bitcoin ASIC M20S recently.\nThese figures suggest that the market is showing signs of life after coming off of some of its worst months. Bitcoin mining is finally profitable for miners and getting its prospects back after the year-long sluggish market.", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 23}

The fire caused significant damage to the church, causing, amongst other damage, the building\u2019s spire to collapse and the roof to burn away. However, the stone foundations are solid, most of the art was already moved off site for the aforementioned renovation work and some of the most famous stained glass windows have survived. Before the fire, money was already spread thin over the potential reconstruction efforts, with the French government offering less than a third of the funds required for renovation.\nJoining the outpouring of international support to address the fire damage, French economic journalist Gr\u00e9gory Raymond has called the crypto community to help with this task, setting up a wallet with several others to quickly accept donations for Notre-Dame\u2019s reconstruction.

It will also assume control of all of QuadrigaCX\u2019s assets.\nErnst & Young Takes Control\nWith QuadrigaCX moving into bankruptcy, it appears that Ernst & Young now becomes the dominant player in this ongoing drama as previously appointed Chief Restructuring Officer Grant Thornton will no longer be involved.\n\u201cEY will continue its investigation, but once it is the trustee, it will have greater powers to do so,\u201d attorney Evan Thomas of Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThis includes the power to examine people who have relevant information under oath.\u201d\nCritically, Ernst & Young will also have the ability to seize the exchange\u2019s assets.\n\u201cThe trustee can also sell QuadrigaCX's assets and start lawsuits to recover property or damages,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThe trustee will collect whatever it can recover for eventual distribution to creditors.\u201d\nThe next step is a meeting of creditors who will elect a Board of Inspectors to oversee the work of Ernst & Young and grant permission to take actions such as selling its remaining assets.\nIt is likely, noted Thomas, that some of the same users elected to the Users Committee \u2014 a group of seven former QuadrigaCX customers who have been representing the 115,000 left stranded by the exchange \u2014 will be elected as these inspectors.\nJennifer Robertson\u2019s Assets Are Frozen\nErnst & Young asked the court for and was granted an \u201casset preservation\u201d order, meaning that all assets held by Jennifer Robertson, the wife of late CEO Gerald Cotten, and the Cotten estate are frozen.\nThe preservation order prohibits Robertson from selling, removing or transferring any assets. However, it allows her to cover her legal and living expenses by granting her access to two bank accounts overseen by Ernst & Young.\nA source close to the case said it appeared that Robertson continues to retain the law firm Stewart McKelvey to represent her and the Cotten estate, despite earlier reports that said the firm was withdrawing its counsel.\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\u201cThere will be a claims process for creditors to file claims for consideration by the trustee,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cEventually, whatever money or other property that is recovered by the trustee will be distributed to creditors with valid claims.\u201d\nThe Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Case (CCAA) will continue temporarily while QuadrigaCX transitions to bankruptcy. Ernst & Young has said that it will be filing at least one more monitor's report. The CCAA will eventually terminate and court proceedings will continue under Canadian bankruptcy law.\nFor a detailed overview of the QuadrigaCX story, read \u201cQuadrigaCX and the Million Dollar Questions: What We Do and Don\u2019t Know.\u201d", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 10}

He was arrested on April 11, 2019, for failing to appear in British courts. Originally in hiding due to a Swedish arrest warrant over allegations of sexual assault completely unrelated to his involvement with Wikileaks, these charges have since been dropped altogether. Nevertheless, the British government has sought his arrest for failing to appear in court for these charges.\nThe elephant in the room for this prosecution is the involvement of the U.S. federal government. Pursuing him with only a single charge of conspiracy to commit computer hacking, law enforcement has made apprehending him a consistent priority as part of a campaign against Wikileaks\u2019 whistleblowers on the War on Terror.\nWikileaks and Bitcoin\nAssange has been a longtime supporter of the Bitcoin community for its ability to circumvent international crackdowns of this nature. After PayPal joined U.S. and Swiss-based banks in banning users from sending donations to Wikileaks, Assange began accepting bitcoin donations as the primary mode of funding in 2011. Wikileaks became one of the first major institutions to accept the payment method, bringing international press coverage to the fledgling crypto community.\nSince then, Wikileaks has gone on to accept a gigantic amount of bitcoin over the years. In 2016, the site\u2019s public donation address reached the milestone of a whopping 4,000 bitcoins, a sum worth millions of dollars. Even as Coinbase cut off support to Wikileaks\u2019 online shop in 2018, the site continues to process sales and receive donations in bitcoin.\nWith the dogged persistence the U.S. government has shown in chasing Assange and other whistleblowers, his future upon extradition seems bleak. Chelsea Manning, the veteran who provided Assange with leaked evidence of U.S. war crimes, had her sentence commuted by U.S. President Obama. Nevertheless, she has been sent back to prison and was even condemned to solitary confinement for a month after refusing to testify against Assange in 2019.\nFellow whistleblower Edward Snowden, who has been in hiding in Russia for several years, called Assange\u2019s arrest \u201ca dark moment for press freedom.\u201d\nAssange\u2019s arrest has already seen pushback from the crypto community, with the Wikileaks public address again seeing a large spike in bitcoin donations from a variety of sources. Still, his upcoming trial in the U.S. is all but certain.\nIf you would like to donate to Wikileaks' mission, the organization's cryptocurrency donation addresses can be found here.", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 11}
{"title": "Chinese Bitcoin Miners Suffer in Iran Despite Cheap Power", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/chinese-bitcoin-miners-suffer-iran-despite-cheap-power/", "birthday": "Apr 10, 2019  4:34 PM EST", "date": "2019-04-10 21:34:00", "content": "8btc\u00a0(https://news.8btc.com/) is regarded as the oldest and the most influential independent platform for bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency news in the Chinese community. Its goal is to bridge the communication gap between the Chinese community and the outside world. News, policy analysis... everything you want to know about crypto in China is here. \nThis article was originally published by 8btc and written by Lylian Teng.\nMany Chinese cryptominers have migrated to places with cheap electricity and favorable policies as a result of the escalated government crackdown on cryptocurrency and its production process.\nWith the rapid downfall of bitcoin prices in late 2018 and increasing electricity bills, Chinese mining investors are looking for alternative places to sustain their businesses. The tightened regulations on cryptomining in the country, for the risk of crypto speculation and concerns about energy usage, urge them to speed up their relocation.\nIn such a context, these unwanted Chinese miners are crossing the border to keep their businesses operating, but they have to tackle various barriers. Large miners move their operations overseas, with Canada, the U.S. and Iceland among their top destinations, while most small- and medium-sized ones turn to Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam in Southeast Asia for geographical proximity.\nSince late 2018, the oil-rich Middle East country of Iran has also been a hotspot for Chinese miners. The country is attracting a growing number of bitcoin miners due to its cheap electricity, which is touted to cost as little as $0.006 per kilowatt-hour.\nIn contrast, electricity provided by hydropower stations in China\u2019s southwestern region usually costs around 0.1 yuan ($0.015) per kilowatt-hour during the high water period in the summer. When winter comes, that cost would triple to $0.04 per kilowatt-hour.\nLiu Feng, who runs a bitcoin mine that holds over 20,000 Antminer T9 units, was lured by the extremely cheap electricity in Iran and is among the first batch miners heading for the oil-rich Middle East country.\nMore than 90 percent of Iran\u2019s electricity is generated by the abundant natural gas there. Simultaneously, the country offers preferential policies for power stations.\n\u201cIf you want to invest in power plants in Iran, the government there will supply free natural gas for the first five years, which further lowers the electricity cost,\u201d said Feng. \u201cGasoline costs only 0.6 yuan [$0.09] per liter and diesel 0.4 yuan [$0.06] per liter. [The] labor cost is also quite cheap.\u201d\nThis makes Iran the paradise of cryptomining. But, as attractive as it seems, the journey to setting up mines in Iran is not a simple one.\n\u201cBecause of the country\u2019s huge electricity subsidy, the government has added this energy-hungry device to the list of 2,000 banned shipments,\u201d Feng said.\nBut border security has not stopped Liu from importing miners into Iran. With the help of some agent who declares miners as computer processors, his first batch \u2014 3,000 T9 miners \u2014 successfully crossed the border.\n\u201cBut the risk of miners being detained and confiscated at the border is quite high,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s said that Iranian customs have so far confiscated at least 40,000 cryptomining rigs of varied models.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s not just border security that is proving to be barriers to miners like Liu Feng. Crossing the border is only the first step in a long march. Setting a foothold in a completely unfamiliar environment is another challenge.\n\u201cI found a power plant and [it] could offer electricity at 0.06 yuan [$0.009] per kilowatt-hour,\u201d Feng said. \u201cAfter deducting the operation costs, we agreed on a 70/30 profit split. But two months later, the power plant claimed a 50/50 split and doubled the electricity price offer.\u201d\nFeng\u2019s first attempt in Iran ended quickly and he resold his miners. Months later, he found a local steel plant with a friend\u2019s help. The steel industry itself consumes vast electricity and the electricity his 3,000 mining rigs consume in comparison is a drop in the bucket. But the noise made from those mining rigs was reported by local residents and all of his miners were confiscated.\nThe situation is changing however, according to the director of a big company in Iran.\n\u201cAt present, only in Iran\u2019s bonded zone could [a] miner import/export [and remain] compliant and tariff free,\u201d the director said.\nThe establishment of the cloud computing industrial park within the bonded zone has also received support from the Iranian president.\n\u201cMining investors need to pay a certain amount of refundable electricity deposits to Iran\u2019s state grid,\u201d the director said. \u201cSmall- and medium-sized miners could apply to enter the industrial park in [a] group \u2026 With nearly 900 megawatts of power [available], the cloud computing industrial park is estimated to hold 500,000 to 600,000 mining machines, possibly [making it] the [world\u2019s] largest mining farm.\u201d\nAccording to the director, there are currently over 10,000 rigs operating in the park.", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 10}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe Understanding Bitcoin conference held in Malta from April 5 to April 7, 2019, was all about turning regular Bitcoin users into power users.\nBitcoin hardware and software is often more configurable than people realize (or they do realize this but are unable to take advantage of it). Spread throughout the conference were 18 demos by leading Bitcoin developers and experts illustrating how to make the most out of available Bitcoin tools.\nFor your convenience, here is an overview of all of the demos:\nBlockstream Green with a Hardware Wallet\nBlockstream Green (formerly known as Green Address and Green Bits) is the mobile and desktop wallet from blockchain development company Blockstream. To secure your coins, the wallet offers multisig security, which means that any transaction from the wallet must be signed off on through several methods. If a potential thief compromises one of these methods \u2014 for example, learning your PIN code or stealing your phone \u2014 they still can\u2019t access any funds. One such additional protection method can be a hardware wallet, which is particularly secure as it never touches the internet and can, therefore, not be hacked online.\nIn this demo, Blockstream engineer Domenico Gabriele showed how to help secure Blockstream Green with a hardware wallet.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrezor Multisig With Electrum\nAs mentioned above, hardware wallets are generally considered one of the most secure ways of storing your coins. However, even (some) hardware wallets are subject to certain very advanced attacks (for example, supply chain attacks or attacks where hackers have physical access to the device). One solution to counter these types of attacks is to secure funds with multisig, using several hardware wallets (ideally stored in different locations) to secure the same coins. The same trick can be used to securely share the same funds between multiple people.\nIn this demo, SatoshiLabs CTO Pavol Rusnak showed how to set this up with an Electrum wallet.\n\n\n\n\n\nCore From Scratch\nThe only way to be sure that the bitcoin payments you receive are valid according to all of Bitcoin\u2019s protocol rules is by using a full node as your wallet or connecting your wallet to your full node. This sounds easy enough, but it also means you need to be sure that the software you are running is, in fact, a full Bitcoin node and not malware. One fairly accessible way of checking this is by verifying that Bitcoin Core developers cryptographically signed the Bitcoin Core software you are running.\nIn this demo, Blockstream engineer Alekos Filini showed how to set up the most-used full node on the network today, Bitcoin Core, from scratch.\n\n\n\n\n\nABCore on Android\nWhile probably a bit excessive for most users today, it is technically possible to run a full node on (some) Android phones or on other Android devices, such as some TV boxes. This brings the same top-notch level of security directly to mobile devices or would allow you to run a full node on a TV box from your home (to which you could connect your mobile wallet, for example).\nIn this demo, Bitcoin developer Udi Wertheimer showed how to install ABCore on Android.\n\n\n\n\n\nCyphernode\nWhile a typical full node lets you receive regular payments securely, it is usually not very flexible from the outset. Cyphernode is a project specifically designed to leverage a full node to support a broader range of use cases, which makes it more useful for merchants, applications and other services.\nIn this demo, Bull Bitcoin CEO Francis Pouliot showed how to set up Cyphernode.\n\n\n\n\n\nC-Lightning With Core\nThe Lightning Network is Bitcoin\u2019s overlay network for fast and cheap transactions and c-lightning is one of the main implementations of the Lightning protocol. Running a Lightning node (and potentially connecting your phone to it) allows you to benefit from this new and rapidly growing technology.\nIn this demo, Blockstream engineer Christian Decker showed how to install c-lightning on a Raspberry Pi.\n\n\n\n\n\nNodl Box\nThe Nodl Box is a hardware device that supports one-click installations of various Bitcoin applications. Most notably, it allows you to easily run a Bitcoin Core full node and the lnd Lightning implementation, as well as several Lightning wallets and the BTCPay Server for merchants.\nIn this demo, Nodl Box developer Ketominer showcased the Hodl Box and several applications, including multiple Lightning wallets and the BTCPay Server.\n\n\n\n\n\nNix-Bitcoin\nWhile any Bitcoin full node allows you to accept payments and create new transactions, the software is typically highly configurable beyond that. Utilizing this configuration, a node can be tuned to offer more privacy, or require less disk space, or rely on different security assumptions. The Nix-Bitcoin project tries to make much of this configuration as accessible as possible.\nIn this demo, Blockstream researcher Jonas Nick showcases Nix-Bitcoin with a specific emphasis on using it for Lightning.\n\n\n\n\n\nThor Turbo\nTo use the Lightning Network, users must first open at least one Lightning channel with another Lightning Network user. This requires a regular, on-chain bitcoin payment, however, which can take from a couple of minutes to several hours to confirm, or in some cases even longer. A new service by bill payment service Bitrefill, Thor Turbo, allows users to take a shortcut and open a channel with Bitrefill instantly with an unconfirmed bitcoin transaction.\nIn this demo, Bitrefill COO John Carvalho demonstrated how to use Thor Turbo.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpark and Charge\nSpark is a Lightning wallet for mobile and web browsers, which can be connected to a c-lightning implementation run at home (or on a server). This allows you to fully and securely benefit from the Lightning Network\u2019s fast and cheap transactions on the go. Charge is a payment processing system, also based on c-lightning, specifically designed for merchants who\u2019d like to accept Lightning payments.\nIn this demo, Bitcoin developer Nadav Ivgi showcased how to install and use Spark and Charge.\n\n\n\n\n\nSlush Pool and \u201cDe-Eviling\u201d the S9\nMining machines are usually delivered with firmware specifically created for the machine. While this firmware does what it needs to do to mine (usually connected to a mining pool), it does not necessarily utilize the full potential of the hardware. (One noteworthy example is that, while Bitmain\u2019s S9 machines were technically able to apply AsicBoost technology, this option was not included in the firmware.) Braiins, the company behind Slush Pool, released the open-source Braiins OS firmware last year, which can be run on mining hardware to take advantage of the full potential of the machines.\nIn this demo, Braiins co-CEO Jan \u010capek showed how to set up the Bitmain S9 with Braiins OS firmware. The demo also showed how to connect a mining machine to Slush Pool.\n\n\n\n\n\nWasabi\nWhen using Bitcoin, you leave a trail of transactions on the blockchain. This allows for blockchain analysis, which can ultimately be used to connect Bitcoin addresses to your real-world identity, which is very bad for privacy. The Wasabi wallet is one of several privacy-enhancing tools available today which effectively allow you to mix your coins with coins of other Wasabi users, breaking the transaction trail for all.\nIn this demo, Wasabi developer Adam Ficsor showed how to use Wasabi Wallet.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoinMarket\nJoinMarket is another privacy solution available today. Like the Wasabi wallet, users \u201cmix\u201d their coins with one another, breaking the transaction trail for all. But where Wasabi Wallet users must sometimes wait several hours for other users to join in before a mix can take place, JoinMarket works instantly, because mixing partners are paid to join in the mix.\nIn this demo, JoinMarket developer Adam Gibson showed how to install JoinMarket and how to leverage it as a regular user. (The demo did not show how to use it as a liquidity provider, however, which is slightly more complex.)\n\n\n\n\n\nElectrum Personal Server\nThe Electrum wallet is one of the most popular bitcoin wallets available today and has been for several years. Electrum wallet users generally rely on Electrum servers, however, which introduces some security and privacy tradeoffs. Using the Electrum Personal Server, Electrum wallet users locally connect to their own private server instead, offering the benefits of the Electrum wallet without any of the tradeoffs.\nIn this demo, Electrum developer Chris Belcher shows how to set up and use an Electrum Personal Server.\n\n\n\n\n\ngoTenna Mesh Networks\nA goTenna is a small hardware device that transmits messages over radio waves; together with similar devices owned by other people, it can create a mesh network. Combined with the Samourai Wallet, goTenna can locally broadcast bitcoin transactions without the internet, for someone with an internet connection to pick up and forward to the Bitcoin network.\nIn this demo, goTenna engineer Richard Myers showed how to send a bitcoin transaction over the goTenna network.\n\n\n\n\n\nLoRaWAN Network\nThe LoRaWAN Network is another solution to locally transmit bitcoin transactions over radio waves for someone with an internet connection to pick up and transmit to the Bitcoin network. It is cheaper to set up than goTenna but also more experimental.\nIn this demo, Blockstream engineer Valerio Vaccaro showcased sending a bitcoin transaction over the LoRaWAN network.\n\n\n\n\n\nSMS Push Transaction\nSince bitcoin transactions are ultimately nothing but a couple of lines of data, they can be sent over any media that supports text messages. This, of course, includes SMS, offering another way of sending bitcoin transactions for intermediaries to pick up and transmit to the Bitcoin network, even without the internet. Indeed, there exists a phone number that will do exactly this.\nIn this demo, SatoshiLabs CTO Pavol Rusnak showcased sending a bitcoin transaction over SMS using the Electrum wallet.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockstream Satellite Network\nThe Blockstream satellite network broadcasts Bitcoin blocks and transactions from space to Earth. This allows (almost) anyone with a satellite dish to sync with the Bitcoin blockchain without requiring access to the internet. Besides benefiting users in areas where there is no internet connection at all, this can also offer cost, privacy and censorship-resistant benefits.\nIn this demo, Blockstream CEO Adam Back and head of the Blockstream satellite project Chris Cook showcased receiving Bitcoin blocks over the Blockstream satellite network.\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 10}

The wallet developers announced the issue on April 7, 2018.\nIn correspondence with Bitcoin Magazine, Electrum developer Thomas Voegtlin speculated that the attack may be a form of retaliation from a phishing attacker who has been targeting Electrum in recent weeks. Since his phishing attacks had been thwarted, the attacker could now be resorting to DoS attacks instead, simply to frustrate Electrum developers and users. Voegtlin pointed out that, if this is the case, the behavior \u201cis not rational\u201d given the incumbent waste of the attacker\u2019s resources.\nA DoS attack is a fairly straightforward means of disrupting server activity, usually carried out by flooding a server with frivolous requests from a variety of different sources to overwhelm its processing capacity. Attacks of this nature can be carried out by an individual or by a number of actors, as the key method of attack is simply to overwhelm the server itself.\nWhen a DoS attack targets a light wallet such as Electrum, it exploits the fact that users do not need to run their own nodes or connect directly to the Bitcoin network and, instead, connect to Electrum servers. By overwhelming these servers with DoS attacks, the wallets become less usable, as it takes a while to find a working server.\nIt\u2019s also possible that the DoS is being carried out by the same person (or group) that was behind the phishing attacks in hopes that the DoS attack will increase the chance that the phishing attack can still succeed this way. As part of the phishing scam, users would connect to fraudulent servers. These fraudulent servers would then send users a phony message asking them to update to a new version of Electrum, sending a link to download coin-stealing malware. Voegtlin speculated that, by adding a DoS attack, the attacker may be hoping to overwhelm the legitimate servers of Electrum, making it more likely that users will inadvertently connect to the malicious servers.\nVoegtlin suggested that the phishing attack is very unlikely to succeed, however: First, because the phishing attack only works on non-updated Electrum clients, and second, it only works if these clients connect only to malicious servers. Since clients always connect to 10 servers, that is very unlikely, he said. If even one of these servers is non-fraudulent, the phishing attempt will fail.\nAccording to Voegtlin, while there is no ETA for the total fix for the DoS attacks, they are already being countered.\n\"We spawned more servers and we found how to blacklist botnet IP addresses,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means some servers are usable now.\" Electrum also plans to ban data-heavy clients as a way of curtailing the processing overload.\nUpdated versions of Electrum are not at risk of the phishing malware, but they can be affected by the DoS attack.\nFor now, Electrum suggests that users \"disable auto-connect and select their server manually.\" Simply waiting a short while often does the trick as well.\n\u201cGive it time; sometimes it connects after a few minutes,\u201d Voegtlin added. He also advises users to stay on a server that works for them and not switch.", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 10}

If you would like to donate, you can find the website here. Less than 24 hours after its launch, the fundraiser has raised $15,500, more than 75 percent of its soft cap goal. You can also donate by purchasing Hodlonaut swag through the BITCOINTEL.PRO store.\nAs community members band together to give Hodlonaut a monetary hand, another prominent member of the community, What Bitcoin Did podcaster Peter McCormack, has been served a similar letter to Hodlonaut\u2019s own. McCormack directly challenged Calvin Ayre and Craig Wright on Twitter earlier this week, coaxing the duo by calling Wright a \u201cfraud\u201d and posting his business address and requesting legal action.\nCraig S. Wright has officially taken the first steps in a legal action against a member of the Bitcoin community, according to a letter shared with Bitcoin Magazine.\nThe self-described Satoshi Nakamoto and Bitcoin SV creator has threatened to sue Hodlonaut, the creator of the Lightning Torch, for a series of tweets labeling him a \u201cfraud\u201d on Twitter. Following the forksplit of Bitcoin SV from Bitcoin Cash \u2014 and Wright\u2019s continued indefatigable insistence that he is Satoshi \u2014 the community has been unyielding in its own insistence that Wright isn\u2019t Satoshi. Tweets calling Craig S. Wright a \u201cfraud\u201d have become something of a meme in the community, inspiring hashtags like #CSWFraud and even going so far as to earn him the moniker \u201cFaketoshi\u201d among his opponents.\nWright has long threatened legal action against anyone who has labeled him a fraud on Twitter, and a letter that Hodlonaut received from Wright\u2019s lawyers finally substantiates what was, for a time, just a looming threat.\nThe Letter and Demands\nIn a series of legal letters shared with Bitcoin Magazine, SCA ONTIER LLP., writing on behalf of Wright, demands that Hodlonaut retract his statements and apologize, or else their client will sue him for libel.\n\u201cWe strongly suggest that you take legal advice upon the contents of this letter, which is written in compliance with the Pre-Action Protocol for Defamation applicable to the High Court of England and Wales,\u201d the letter begins.\nThe firm, which states that Wright \u201cis the person behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto,\u201d continues to solicit Hodlonaut for his full name, email address and postal address (the letter was transmitted via Twitter). If Hodlonaut does not comply, \u201c[Wright] will take steps to ascertain them by other means, including, if necessary, the making of applications to court to compel disclosure of this information by you and/or third parties.\u201d\nFor the remainder of the letter\u2019s first and second pages, the firm documents the tweets in question, which label Wright a \u201cscammer\u201d and call for \u201cCraig Wright is a fraud Week\u201d with the hashtag #CraigWrightIsAFraud.\n\u201cBy tagging to [this] hashtag,\u201d the letter charges, \u201cyou encourage your follows to view and contribute to that thread, which \u2026 is no more than a crude means by which our client can be abused and libelled.\u201d\nSaying that Hodlonaut\u2019s \u201ccampaign against [Wright] has been sustained and systematic,\u201d the firm then falsely states that this is because Hodlonaut is a promoter of Bitcoin Cash, an ostensible rival to the recently forked Bitcoin SV. Anyone who follows Hodlonaut on Twitter knows that this is a bizarre claim, as the user is an ardent Bitcoiner who has even aired grievances against Roger Ver for attacking the integrity of Bitcoin with the Bitcoin Cash fork.\nThe letter asserts that, taken in bulk, Hodlonaut\u2019s claims that Wright isn\u2019t Satoshi \u201chas caused serious harm\u201d to Wright. \u201cThe defamatory allegation,\u201d it continues, has spread to Hodlonaut\u2019s 8,000 plus followers \u2014 a \u201csubstantial portion\u201d of which reside in its U.K. jurisdiction, the firm assumes.\nThe letter concludes with a series of demands. First, that Hodlonaut delete all of the tweets referenced in the letter (he\u2019s done this under recommendation of his legal counsel, along with deleting his Twitter entirely); second, that he not repeat these allegations; and third, that Hodlonaut tweet an apology and appear in open court to apologize to Wright in person, acknowledging the \u201cfalsity of the allegations.\u201d\nIncredibly, the letter includes a prescribed apology that reads as follows:\n\u201cI was wrong to allege Craig Wright fraudulently claimed to be Satoshi. I accept he is Satoshi. I am sorry Dr. Wright. I will not repeat this libel.\u201d\nThe Fallout\nWright threatens to sue Hodlonaut on the grounds of defamation and libel if he doesn\u2019t comply with the demands within seven days of receiving the letter. This, as the letter admits, \u201cis shorter than the period usually provided for by Pre-Action Protocol because the allegations are serious and ongoing\u201d (even though Hodlonaut hasn\u2019t tweeted about Wright since).\nThis directive expired on April 5. The letter says that, if the demands are not met, then Wright will file for proceedings in U.K. court and Hodlonaut will be served in his home country of Norway. Hodlonaut\u2019s address is not public, however, and while the letter threatens that it will \u201clocate [him]\u201d to serve the litigation, this will likely prove difficult. A source close to the matter, who asked to remain anonymous, has indicated that no further action has yet been taken.\nCoinGeek, the tabloid-esque cryptocurrency blog owned by Wright\u2019s associate, Calvin Ayre, recently blew the escalating legal action into the open. The article reiterates much of what the legal letter said. But it also offers up a doxing bounty of $5,000 in BSV (enough for a whole bitcoin) to anyone who can identify Hodlonaut by tattoos displayed in the few photos he\u2019s posted online.\nIt also targets other \u201csocial media sock-puppets\u201d who have followed suit with Hodlonaut\u2019s accusations, threatening that \u201cthese internet tough guys will have their own day in court soon enough.\u201d Remarks like this run rampant in the article, which continues to assert that \u201cHodlonaut and the other trolls are about to discover why \u2018he who laughs last, laughs best.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re in for an even greater shock when they realize that the bastardized Bitcoin variants they\u2019ve championed can\u2019t scale to meet the needs of a truly global financial platform, and thus they\u2019ve expended all this vitriol for nothing.\u201d\nAyre, who has come under intense scrutiny recently for a rendezvous with allegedly underage Cuban dancers, has migrated some of the article\u2019s threats to Twitter and has insinuated that more letters will be served to others Twitter users soon.\n\nmore letters coming so more Trolls can show the size of their nauts soon :-)\u2014 Calvin Ayre (@CalvinAyre) April 11, 2019\n\n\nIn a show of solidarity and resilience, a community movement has been fomented to show support for Hodlonaut. Twitter users have instigated the hashtag #WeAreAllHodlonaut, an homage to the popular shibboleth We Are All Satoshi \u2014 and its all-too-relevant variant \u201cWe Are All Satoshi (Except Craig Wright).\u201d\n\nI can confirm I am behind the account @hodlonaut, what next @CalvinAyre?Do we get to go to court?

The problem? Crypto is complicated, security is tricky and \u2014 if we\u2019re being frank \u2014 the suits don\u2019t know a bit from a byte (or a blockchain from a cloud server).\nIn fact, you could rightly say that what makes crypto, well, crypto actually makes them nervous. Unlike settling traditional assets, you can\u2019t reverse a bitcoin transaction, the blockchain offers no internal or centralized controls and there\u2019s no one to go to if you muck up a transaction. Bitcoin is everything that the traditional finance sector is not, so it\u2019s understandable that Wall Street and friends would be wary of holding an asset they don\u2019t understand and can\u2019t control.\nAnd holding is precisely the issue. In its many ETF rejections, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission returns to the same problem (among others like market maturity) ad infinitum: ETF providers must ensure proper custody for crypto assets so mismanagement doesn\u2019t throw investor funds into the void.\nSo how do we give these institutions proper custody to appease both them and the regulators? Striking up a partnership with Legacy Trust, a Hong Kong-based asset management firm, French hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger thinks it\u2019s whipped up a solution.\nIntroducing Ledger Vault\n\u201cWe want to be the technology provider for the folks who want self-custody, [to] have their own keys and be their own bank, but we also want to provide it to the larger institutions that want to provide a service into the marketplace,\u201d Demetrios Skalkotos, global head of Ledger Vault, told Bitcoin Magazine.\nThe Ledger Vault bills itself as the world\u2019s first institutional-grade, multi-authorization wallet management tool. During our interview, Skalkotos told us that the Ledger Vault separates itself from other custody solutions by being more holistic in its approach, encompassing both hardware and software technology solutions. As a tech company first, he elucidates, they\u2019re not concerned only with business practices.\n\u201cWe are a hardware/software security company. Most of the folks in the market today are process-oriented solutions rather than technology-oriented solutions.\u201d\nThese solutions involve one of Ledger\u2019s existing devices, the Ledger Blue, its BOLOS operating system and a hardware security module (HSM). The BOLOS operating system, which powers the Ledger Blue, interacts with the HSM, which is used to store keys for transaction and fund management authorization. Skalkotos says that the combination of the two pieces of hardware and Ledger\u2019s proprietary software create an \u201cencrypted endpoint and secure channel\u201d to allow the Ledger Blue and the HSM to talk to each other. This, in turn, allows users to facilitate multi-authorized transactions.\nTo set this up, each of the account\u2019s multiple stakeholders generate a key/seed, which are then combined to create a master seed. Then, the shared owners devise the account\u2019s governance scheme (like how many people are needed to sign off on a transaction) and appoint administrators. These administrators can designate account operators and assign them varying degrees of responsibilities/permissions. Ultimately, the administrators are in charge of setting rules for transactions, such as timelocks, authorization requirements, etc. But, depending on permissions, operators could have the ability to create, authorize or cancel transactions.\nPreferring the phrase multi-authorization rather than multi-signature, Skalkotos said that this scheme allows for a great degree of flexibility for fund management. The solution allows its users to set up multiple wallets and offers four levels of governance, ranging from what Skalkotos called a \u201cwarmer\u201d variant, which only requires two to three approvers, to a \u201ccolder\u201d one that would need eight to nine approvers. The latter, which would be much slower, would likely be used by a trust and could be a treasury wallet of sorts.\n\u201cIn essence, you're eliminating the single point of failure. What you\u2019re providing is a device to initiate and approve a transaction as a part of a bigger governance scheme.\u201d\nThe solution could be used by any flavor of financial firms who want to add crypto assets to their portfolio, including hedge funds, family offices, banks and trust companies. It could also be used by exchanges to bolster their security and custody practices. While Ledger Vault was built primarily for institutional custody, however, Skalkotos told us that they are \u201cworking at all levels from a retail side and institutional side.\u201d\nThey\u2019re also working to build additional services on top of the solution, including staking services (the solution accommodates ERC20 tokens) and bolting on liquidity options.\nWith a global team presence in San Francisco, New York, Paris and (with this latest partnership) Hong Kong, Ledger boasts of growing a \u201cdiversified group of international clients across the board\u201d since Ledger Vault went into beta in January 2019.", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 11}

The exchange had rejected the agreement based on issues it had with the requirements.\nAmong other things, the agreement had capitalization requirements that were significantly higher than was required in other states.

The community has branded him \u201cFaketoshi\u201d for this claim, inspiring such Twitter hashtags as #CraigWrightIsAFraud.\nWhen the trend took off, Wright threatened legal action against anyone who calls him a fraud on the grounds of libel, taking aim at no individual in particular. This nebulous threat, though, was finally substantiated when Wright sent a cease-and-desist order to Hodlonaut.\nThe anonymous bitcoiner then deleted his Twitter account at the behest of his legal council and, though Wright can only serve him the threatened lawsuit if he obtains his physical address \u2014 an effort that Wright\u2019s colleague, Calvin Ayre, has aided him in by launching a doxing campaign through his website CoinGeek \u2014 community members launched a fundraiser to cover Hodlonaut\u2019s legal costs.

News, policy analysis... everything you want to know about crypto in China is here. \nThis article was originally published by 8btc and written by Chloe Jiang.\nThe former director of Bitmain\u2019s mining farm, a leading bitcoin mining operation, once said the wet season may not be as much of a boon for miners as many thought. As he expected, mining farms in Sichuan currently report that the supply of slots for mining equipment has far exceeded the demand.\nThe wet season in Sichuan usually begins in April and ends in October every year. During this time, the cost of electricity can be as low as 0.25 yuan for a Sichuan mining farm, which should be very attractive for miners. The price of electricity is around 0.35 yuan in Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia.\nSome industry insiders speculated that 80 percent of the mining farm operators in Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia would move to Sichuan and Guizhou due to this price difference. It was also reported that many farm operators started their migration even before the Chinese Lunar New Year in February because they couldn\u2019t wait to make a profit during the drawn out \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d\nSo, it comes as a surprise that there are more miners available than there is demand.\nAccording to the founder of Tiantian Ming Farm, mining farm operators have added 500,000 slots compared to the same period last year but haven\u2019t sold much of them yet. The balance of supply and demand has been broken.\nIn addition, there is more bad news for mining farms: the standard market price of electricity in Sichuan is 0.25 yuan, but many mining farm operators cut this electricity price under the table in order to sell their mining slots faster.\nBitdeer appears to be the first firm to initiate a price war around these low costs.

Those on the left prefer a more controlled economy, while those on the right have a preference for free markets. Libertarians tend to promote more liberal social policies, while authoritarians want to control what people do in the privacy of their own homes.\n\n\nThis is generally how political leanings are defined today, but technologies like Bitcoin and end-to-end encryption are changing that as our digital lives become, in some ways, more important than what we do in the real, physical world.\nAs technologists have explained to lawmakers around the world over and over again, encryption is either secure or it isn\u2019t. Backdoors for law enforcement do not work because they create security holes. Either the encrypted messages you send over the internet are private or they aren\u2019t.\nThis leads to a dichotomy where governments can either gain access to their citizen\u2019s private messages, finances and other personal data or they can\u2019t. The situation is black and white: People are either able to use encryption or they live in a surveillance state.\n\n\n@MarcHochstein @BlueMeanie4 @ErikVoorhees @EFF this is the choice forced onto people by bitcoin: freedom vs tyranny. No inbetween.\u2014 Kyle 'Hodlonaut' Torpey (@kyletorpey) October 18, 2014\n\n\nAuthoritarians may want access to your personal data in order to make sure you\u2019re following the government-approved social norms, while leftists will want access to your finances in order to make sure you\u2019re paying your \u201cfair share\u201d of taxes.\nIn an increasingly digital age, both of these political factions would desire what effectively amounts to surveillance in order to bring their values into the digital realm. The libertarian right is the only quadrant that may have no desire or need for mass surveillance.\nSo, the new political split is between those in favor of surveillance and those in favor of privacy.\nPeter Thiel and Reid Hoffman on the Topic\nThis new paradigm for politics was discussed by PayPal Co-Founder Peter Thiel and LinkedIn Co-Founder Reid Hoffman at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University in 2018.\nThis contrast between crypto and big data was originally brought up by Thiel in terms of centralization and decentralization.\n\u201cEven though I think these things are underdetermined, I do think these two map, in a way, politically very tightly on this centralization [versus] decentralization thing,\u201d said Thiel. \u201cCrypto is decentralizing. AI is centralizing. If you want to frame it more ideologically, you could say that crypto is libertarian and AI is communist.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThiel expanded on this idea, noting that AI is about big data, governments controlling all of that data, those governments then knowing more about their citizens than they know about themselves and governments attempting to hold society together through centralized control rather than spontaneous order. He pointed to the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s love of AI and hatred for crypto as a more direct example of this philosophy in practice.\nHoffman tweaked Thiel\u2019s libertarian versus communist analogy and stated, \u201cYou could say it\u2019s [anarchy] versus rule of law.\u201d\nThiel added, \u201cI would say AI is a much more transparent world \u2014 the centralized world is more transparent. And then the question you go and ask is: What\u2019s the opposite of transparency? Is it criminality or is it privacy?\u201d\nWhere Will This Take Us?\nThis move toward digital privacy as the key divider between political ideologies has implications that are difficult to predict. It\u2019s unclear what happens next.\nThe most interesting development may be with left libertarians, who will need to decide whether or not they actually care about online privacy, because Bitcoin has created a situation where financial privacy on the internet is possible.\nIn reality, there are limits to the concept of crypto anarchy. While things like Bitcoin may make it more difficult to collect taxes in some instances, governments will be able to evolve in order to protect their revenue streams. Taking the tax issue to the extreme, government employees can still show up at property owners\u2019 homes with guns and demand tribute.\nIt\u2019s possible that dragnet surveillance may become less useful as more people turn to encryption and old-fashioned police work will be needed more frequently to solve cases.\nOf course, this assumes that the advocates of online privacy will win out over the authoritarians from an ideological perspective. It\u2019s still unclear whether much of the population cares about protecting its personal data from the likes of Facebook, Google and government agencies.\nAt the end of the day, technology is on the side of those who are in favor of strong privacy, which makes it more difficult to control. How this all plays out may depend on how violent leftists and authoritarians are willing to get in order to protect the idea of a centralized, controlled society on the internet.\nThis is a guest post by Kyle Torpey.

{"title": "Vidi, Vici, Satoshi: The Lightning Torch Has Reached Its Final Destination", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/vidi-vici-satoshi-lightning-torch-has-reached-its-final-destination/", "birthday": "Apr 11, 2019  5:42 PM EST", "date": "2019-04-11 22:42:00", "content": "Colin is an associate editor and staff writer for Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0 He's proud to call Nashville his home, where he lives with his family and doesn't eat hot chicken as much as you might think.\u00a0\n\nThe Lightning Torch, a Lightning Network payment that has been forwarded to bitcoiners around the world via Twitter, has run its course and reached its end in the charitable hands of Bitcoin Venezuela.\nIt\u2019s grown a lot since we last covered it in February. In fact, the term \u201cTorch\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to do it justice anymore. At this point, it could rightly be called a bonfire.\nAdmittedly, it\u2019d be impossible to pass a bonfire around the world (a Torch sounds much more feasible), but the Lightning Torch doesn\u2019t care much for the impossible or implausible. Ten years ago, the prospect of passing a digital payment to every continent shy of Antarctica would have been unthinkable. Even less thinkable: this payment chain would be passed uninterrupted (well, mostly uninterrupted, save two kinks) over 275 times with hardly anyone\u2019s own opportunism getting the better of it.\nIt\u2019s intersected with economically sanctioned countries like Iran, fallen into the hands of a Finnish model, been highly publicized after Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey took part and become a gleaming example of bitcoin\u2019s resilience as a currency that has no regard for borders, edicts or politics.\nAs the Torch enters its final stretch, it has cleared a series of significant hurdles; from escaping greedy hands to transcending economic sanctions, the Torch has more than lived up to the hopes of its Prometheus.\n\u201cI never expected it to go anywhere,\u201d Hodlonaut, the Torch\u2019s creator, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cIt was just a fun little thing that I did; it\u2019s not like I sat and planned this out.\u201d\nIgniting the Flame\nLike any Twitter trend that goes viral within a niche community, the Lightning Torch began as a bit of \u201cfun.\u201d Hodlonaut, whom I have described as an astronautical tomcat before (and will again and again), wanted to spread excitement for and awareness of the Lightning Network, so he decided to send 100,000 satoshis to the first person in his tweet thread that he trusted.\nIt came with a catch \u2014 or at least an expectation. The recipient would have to add 10,000 sats and then pass it on to someone else, then that person would add more, and so on.\n\nSome LN fun.. - I send 100k sats with https://t.co/va7XSnFii0 to the first person I choose to trust that replies to this. - That person adds 10k sats and sends 110k to someone (Either from reply to a new tweet, or this thread).. and so on How many sats before it breaks?\u2014 hodlonaut\ud83c\udf2e\u26a1\ud83d\udd11 (@hodlonaut) January 19, 2019\n\n\n\u201cIf somebody asked me on the first day, \u2018How far do you think it would go?\u2019 I would have said, \u201810 or 20 hops,\u2019\u201d Hodlnaut recalled. Turns out, he was lowballing it. After 292 passes, it would reach the 4.29 million satoshi limit Hodlonaut set for it.\nThe seminal passes were mainly lowkey Bitcoin enthusiasts and/or professionals just looking to get in on the fun. They included a couple of duplicate passings, as interest wasn\u2019t fully fledged. Everything ran pretty smoothly during the Torch\u2019s first days and (nearly) everyone played nice. I say \u201cnearly\u201d because, on the 14th pass, the Torch ran into a problem.\n\nWhat if I Decide it to keep it? \ud83d\ude02what will happen to me ?\u2014 sirLordBTC (@SerWisdom69) January 20, 2019\n\n\nsirLordBTC (who, with an EPIC name like that, we\u2019re not surprised tried to screw the system), absconded with the Torch when it was worth under $10. So, all in all, it\u2019s not like he profited much from his sophomoric trick \u2014 he likely just wanted to be a contrarian little edgelord.\nHodlonaut actually predicted that, after those first 10 to 20 successful hops, at some point the Torch would be stolen. Technically, his foresight was accurate but, thankfully, the sender, Ruben Johansen, refueled the Torch with 250,000 satoshi and passed it along to someone else. Cracking on, the only other trouble the Torch had would come at 2.51 million satoshis, when pseudonymous user eduard_btc decided to \u201cseize\u201d it because he could.\n\nSo I\u2019m currently proudly holding the Lightning Torch. I'll seize it because i can, and no one can stop me. This is bitcoin,Lightning Network is unfairly cheap and fast #LNTrustChain #bitcoin #reckless\u2014 Eduard \u26a1\ufe0f (@eduard_btc) January 31, 2019\n\n\nHe received a lot of heat in the ensuing Twitter thread, wherein he justified his decision with the whole \u201cdon\u2019t trust, verify\u201d schtick. Still, he eventually buckled under the communal pressure as the general consensus was that he was acting like a jerk, so he sent it back to sender Klaus Lovegreen, who had already pledged to reup the balance and pass it on to a more trustworthy individual.\nBuilding Heat\nBarring those two outlying users, the Torch\u2019s movement has been largely uninterrupted. And it eventually made its way to plenty of big name bitcoiners.\nAn early one of these was Pierre Rochard. A staunch Bitcoin maximalist, Rochard\u2019s popular Lightning node launcher has garnered him a reputation for being one of the space\u2019s premier Lightning Network enthusiasts and educators, so it made sense that he\u2019d hop on so early, and it\u2019s fitting that he\u2019d get to take part.\nFrom here, the flame would pass between the hoi polloi and high profiles alike. Jack Mallers, Brooke Mallers, Nicolas Dorier, D. Dickerson, John Carvalho and the Bitrefill team, Armin Van Bitcoin, Zack Voel, Anthony Pompliano and even Andreas Antonopoulos would all hold the Torch before it hit the 150 passes mark. Halfway to 300 passes, the Torch\u2019s popularity definitely reached a tipping point.\nAt this juncture, Matt Odell reached out to Twitter Co-Founder and CEO Jack Dorsey, who responded by sending Odell an invoice. Crypto Twitter freaked out, the news made industry (and mainstream) media headlines and the Torch\u2019s prominence blazed forth, putting it in the hands of even more bitcoin (and other cultural) leaders.\nFrom Dorsey, it would go to Lightning Labs Co-Founder Elizabeth Stark. The next 85 passes would be populated by industry heavyweights like Samson Mow, Riccardo Spagni, Alena Satoshi, Whale Panda, Giacomo Zucco, Changpeng Zhao (who took the opportunity to shill BNB), Justin Sun (who took the opportunity to shill TRON), Erik Voorhees, Meltem Demirors, the BitMEX Research team, Ben Davenport, Randy Brito, the CoinGecko team, Boxmining, Mia Tam, Andy Cheung, Charlie Shrem, Vijay Boyapati, Adam Back, Reid Hoffman \u2014 and even the team here at Bitcoin Magazine.\nLater on in its lifespan, it would also pass through the hands of the team at Slush Pool, Peter Wuille, Jill Carlson, Laura Shin, Peter McCormack, the \u201cFree Ross Ulbricht\u201d campaign and our own Aaron van Wirdum.\nWith names like these partaking, the Torch\u2019s popularity was hotter than ever. What started as a fun experiment had grown into a cultural movement of sorts with multiple components. This memetic metamorphosis (both the cultural evolution of the Torch and its meme value) has even been chronicled in the artistic renderings of CryptoMemeCentral. In short, the Torch became immensely popular and graduated to full meme status; the tracking of it has become a sort of pastime in the bear market and big names fanned its popularity.\nBut this popularity also had the unintended consequence of shutting common bitcoiners out. Some on Twitter complained that the surplus of elites vying for the Torch meant that they had become overrepresented in the pool of passers. Tweeting his opinion, Hodlonaut agreed and suggested that it would be wise to keep the process from devolving into exclusivity.\n\u201cIt looked at some point like it would turn into something that was unavailable to the common guy,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cI think fortunately we ended up with a good balance overall. There have been periods of only high-profile people, but pretty organically, it ended up in the hands of lower-profile people.\u201d\nCircumventing Sanctions, Reaching Disadvantaged Populations\nFollowing a particularly long strand of high-flying passers which ended with Bitcoin Magazine, the Torch not only landed in the hands of under-the-radar bitcoiners, but it would blaze on in some of the areas that need bitcoin the most.\n\u201cBitcoin is a safe-haven,\u201d Ziya Sadr, an Iranian Bitcoin enthusiast and technology writer who took the Torch, told Bitcoin Magazine.\nAround the time we took the Torch, a groundswell of community sentiment was pushing for Sadr to accept the Torch on behalf of Iran. The symbolic move would speak volumes to the power of permissionless, censorship-resistant currency, given the international sanctions that have economically annexed the country from the bulk of the world and its government\u2019s repressive stance against technology and financial tools (bitcoin being no exception here).\nThere was a general fear that, as a financial instrument, bitcoin is prone to the financial sanctions that the U.S. government has levied against Iran. As a U.S.-based company, Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s owner, BTC Inc, didn\u2019t want to take the risk. We even asked the U.S. Treasury on Twitter if sending bitcoin to Iran this way would be permissible (and didn\u2019t get a reply).\nSo we sent it to Welsh bitcoiner Bitgeiniog instead, who (as promised) passed it on to Sadr in what they called a \u201ccypherpunk, authoritarian-busting move.\u201d For Sadr, who believes that the fretting over sanctions \u201ctriggered people to think that bitcoin isn\u2019t what it\u2019s meant to be: a tool to defy censorship which will not conform to governments and sanctions,\u201d the historic moment was incredibly moving and had a significant impact on the Iranian Bitcoin community.\n\u201cIt was a very bold and public experiment, getting in touch with sanctioned people, people who are exiled from the rest of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThis carried a lot of optimism for the Iran Bitcoin community, and this community represents the rest of people in Iran: the Bitcoin community has people from every category; there are businessmen, investors, entrepreneurs, teachers. It gave us promise; it proved to us that Bitcoin is borderless.\u201d\nHodlonaut said something similar about the Iranian pass in our conversation, namely that the \u201cmain takeaway [is that the Torch] connects people directly.\u201d\nSadr said that this gesture of goodwill shows that the Iranian Bitcoin community, which some of us in the West may ignore, \u201cis on equal ground\u201d with the rest of the world.\nI\u2019d venture to say they\u2019re even on higher ground. In a country where MasterCard and PayPal are banned (and your bank account can be frozen if you\u2019re caught transacting with either), bitcoin offers a tenable alternative to an unstable economic climate.\nIt even opens up access to the web at large, said Sadr. He purchased a virtual private network using bitcoin from NordVPN, something he couldn\u2019t dream of doing with the rial, given international sanctions. Telegram, YouTube, Twitter, you name it \u2014 all of these are blocked in Iran, but they\u2019re accessible with a VPN.\nSadr, who freelances in exchange for bitcoin to make ends meet, said that bitcoin is increasing in popularity as the rial\u2019s value plummets. People are attracted to earning their wages in foreign currency and bitcoin is more attractive still, given its ability to circumvent the government\u2019s vice grip on personal finances.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very active black market \u2014 everything is a black market in Iran. Foreign currency markets are black market, so it\u2019s actually the norm,\u201d Sadr said.\nLocalBitcoins and Telegram chats are part of this black market and have become common watering holes, and there are two Iran-specific exchanges that people will use to trade, despite the government's best efforts to block the URLs to these sites.\nFor the Iranian Bitcoin community and its online hubs, Sadr said that \u201cthe number has been growing, even though it\u2019s a bear market \u2014 we still see, regardless of all the FUD that\u2019s being spread in the media and the space, the numbers are growing in the communities that I\u2019m active in.\u201d\nAs part of the Persian New Year custom, Sadr and his bitcoin buddies have been giving people money. But for this year\u2019s holiday, they\u2019re not passing out rials \u2014 they\u2019re sending sats through the Lightning Network or through mainnet. He thinks that the token of gratitude will help to educate his countrymen and help ease their access to a financial system that they otherwise might not be able to leverage.\n\u201cI meet a lot of people who know that they can use bitcoin to transfer money easily, but they just haven\u2019t tried it yet,\u201d Sadr said.\nThe Torch\u2019s Legacy\nThe situation in Iran calls to memory Venezuela\u2019s own political and economic hardship. The Torch has made it there, too \u2014 multiple times in fact. The Torch ultimately reached Bitcoin Venezuela, a charity organization which has fed thousands of economically dispossessed citizens thanks to cryptocurrency donations. As its final bearer, Bitcoin Venezuela will blow the Torch out and transmute its altruistic embers into food, necessities and medicine for Venezuelans in need. A number of community members have pledged to match this donation.\n\n\u26a1\ufe0f All good things must come to an end! We (me and @Chris_Stewart_5) passed the torch to its final recipient, @btcven \u26a1\ufe0f preimage: 58dea15cd4d3898718ae013b18a773d6af8ee80e68c54d7d783ce12ffdf54959. it's been an honor \ud83d\ude4f https://t.co/TAlZDMSWK8\u2014 torkel (@torkelrogstad) April 13, 2019\n\n\nThe Lightning Torch may have begun as fun, but its intersection with economically and politically destabilized areas is anything but trivial. Its ability to transcend borders, nationalities and ideologies is testament to the fact that Satoshi\u2019s gift to the world (and its grassroots community) is resilient and, by and large, chock-full of goodwill.\n\u201cI think that says a lot about this community,\u201d Hodlonaut mused. \u201cPeople are good in this space. I\u2019ve seen so much positive stuff coming out of this.\u201d\nThe \u201crandom\u201d and \u201corganic\u201d trajectory of the Torch, he continued, \u201ctells volumes about the global nature of bitcoin.\u201d Sure as Satoshi, the proof is in the numbers.\nIn total, 278 unique participants from 56 countries have sent the Torch to every continent except for Antarctica (though one passer did place their phone on a rock from Antarctica while receiving it, but that really only counts in spirit). Just over 7 BTC has been transacted (roughly 700 million satoshis!) over a period of 83 days.\nSo inspiring is this experiment-turned-movement that it has spawned offshoots. Obscure altcoin Ravencoin had an on-chain version, and there\u2019s one called the Tiny Torch that has taken off on Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network, too. While he had it, Litecoin creator Charlie Lee intimated that he would fork the Torch to Litecoin\u2019s Lightning Network. This didn\u2019t go over too well, though, and Lee eventually removed the tweet with this claim (some saw it as self-promotion and Hodlonaut wanted to make sure there was no confusion between offshoots and the #LNTrustChain hashtag that has demarcated the Torch\u2019s movement).\nHodlonaut doesn\u2019t want the original to fork either, less it get \u201cstale.\u201d He said that a finish line is necessary and that, without it, the Torch loses its significance.\nHe also told Bitcoin Magazine that keeping track of the Torch\u2019s movement and documenting the phenomenon on its website has been a taxing, \u201caround the clock\u201d job. Given how much impact the Torch has had, we asked him what would be next when this was all over.\n\u201cI think I need a vacation,\u201d he chuckled in response.\nWell, he\u2019s more than earned one, and thanks to the number of ancillary torches that have proliferated under the light of the original, he can take his rest while the influence of his creativity shines forth in multiple iterations. Much like Satoshi passing the Torch of his creation to a decentralized community of developers and enthusiasts, Hodlonaut\u2019s ingenuity has been passed to a community eager to continue this exercise of trust.\nSo, the Lightning Torch\u2019s creator can take his vacation; Bitcoin doesn\u2019t take vacations.\nTo see all of the places the Torch has been, you can track its movements here.

He entered a guilty plea in late October, the DOJ stated, \u201cadmitting that he operated a Bitcoin exchange without registering with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the U.S. Department of Treasury, and without implementing the required anti-money laundering safeguards.\u201d\nA Mexican-born, U.S. citizen, Campos moved more than $1 million between the two nations with the help of several associates, all without reporting the transfers. Other than this, however, the majority of the actual crimes the DOJ charged him with involve the running of what is essentially an unlicensed exchange, with no anti-money laundering or due diligence measures.\nThe DOJ has long shown interest in financial crimes that involve crypto assets and prosecuting criminals using new methods. As early as 2015, for example, when the value of one bitcoin had yet to surpass $1,000, the DOJ hosted a summit for regulators, law enforcement and cryptocurrency stakeholders. Its efforts to stay on top of the crypto industry have persisted ever since, particularly with the department launching an investigation into price manipulation in 2018.\nThe prosecution\u2019s main argument in the Campos case followed this trend, claiming that \u201cunlicensed money transmitters pose a serious threat to the integrity of the U.S. financial system by creating a hole in the anti-money laundering regulatory scheme and allowing criminals to launder their cash proceeds without scrutiny.\u201d\nThis verdict sets a clear precedent that a certain threshold of direct peer-to-peer exchanges of crypto for cash can open one up to prosecution.\nDavid Shaw, a special agent for homeland security investigations in San Diego, called the trial a \u201creminder to those illegal and unlicensed money transmitters that the laws and rules apply to cryptocurrency dealings just as they do to other types of financial transactions,\u201d per the DOJ announcement.\nAs long as trades are carried out over official exchanges, however, they should remain free of prosecution.", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 12}

Since publishing this article, Bitcoin Magazine has learned that Eric Meltzer, a co-founder of Primitive Ventures, is one of the treasure hunt's orchestrators.\n\u201cWhat you are reading is the first clue in a grand Hunt,\u201d according to the message. \u201cIt is not the first Hunt, nor of course will it be the last one, but the hunt is MINE, and so it is to me that you must prove yourself.\u201d\nThe message proceeds to lay out the ground rules in some pretty enigmatic terms, and its final prize, \u201cneither gold, nor jewels, nor the pieces of worthless paper that pass for money in this sad age,\u201d it emphasizes, will go to \u201cthe most successful Hunters and their clan.\u201d\nThe game master fractured the final million dollar bitcoinucopia into one thousand pieces, using the \u201csplitting magic of the wizard Shamir.\u201d Treasure hunters must find 400 of these pieces and use Shamir\u2019s \u201cspell of recombination\u201d to seize the hoard of digital gold.\n\u201cOnce you have done so, the treasure will be irrevocably yours,\u201d the message proclaimed.\nWhile the reference to Shamir might sound like a character from Magic: The Gathering or Dungeons & Dragons, it\u2019s actually a reference to Israeli cryptographer Adi Shamir, who invented the secret key sharing mechanism that the game master\u2019s hunt is likely employing to split the bitcoin stash\u2019s private key into multiple shards.\nThe first three keys referenced in the initial message will be revealed on April 16, April 17 and April 18, 2019, at three provided geographic coordinates at noon in their respective time zones.\nSatoshi\u2019s Treasure enters a tradition of similar puzzles and games whereby anonymous enthusiasts \u2014 whether by virtue of generosity, curiosity, boredom or all three \u2014 embed reference to bitcoin private keys in art, pictures or other forms of media. The most recent of these took place in France, when $1,000 worth of bitcoin was hidden inside a recreation of the famous \u201cLiberty Leading the People.\u201d Perhaps the most famous example of such puzzles, The Legend of Satoshi Nakamoto, was cracked in early 2018 after stumping would-be solvers for three years.\nThis article has been updated to indicate that Primitive Ventures co-founder, Eric Meltzer, is partly behind the game.", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 15}

While it initially appeared unlikely that the funds would ever be recovered, a recent police raid conducted in South Korea is giving hope that some of the money may be returned.\nPer reports from a local news outlet, the Cyber \u200b\u200bInvestigation Department of South Korea\u2019s National Police Agency has seized an external server that it believes to be associated with the attack on Bithumb. While at first the theft was believed to be an inside job because no evidence of an external hacker was found, upon closer inspection the police found proof of an external server and IP address that it suspected to be involved. That server has now been found and seized by law enforcement officials.\nDetails are still sketchy about the culprits of the attack and how they managed to steal millions of dollars\u2019 worth of cryptocurrency, including 3 million EOS tokens. Local officials believe more details may come to light as police analysts search the hard drive of the seized server and find evidence linked to the person or group behind the crime.\nHowever, according to the officials involved, it\u2019s not going to be easy. Even though blockchain transactions are transparent, one Korean official noted that it will be challenging to track the crime because the perpetrator has used multiple paths to mask their actions.\nIt won\u2019t help that, globally, many police departments are unequipped to deal with cryptocurrency hacks and that few police officers have a deep understanding of blockchain technology or how it works.\nIf the police are able to determine who committed the attack and zero in on the perpetrator\u2019s exact location, they might be able to make an arrest and recover some of the lost funds.\nThe only upside to this hack is that the funds stolen belonged to the exchange, not customers, so retail investors did not lose their coins. Last year, Bithumb suffered a major security breach, which saw hackers steal $30 million worth of cryptocurrencies belonging to users from its wallets.", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 16}
{"title": "In Fourth Report, QuadrigaCX Court Monitor Recommends Bankruptcy Proceedings", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/fourth-report-quadrigacx-court-monitor-recommends-bankruptcy-proceedings/", "birthday": "Apr 2, 2019  6:16 PM EST", "date": "2019-04-02 23:16:00", "content": "Colin is an associate editor and staff writer for Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0 He's proud to call Nashville his home, where he lives with his family and doesn't eat hot chicken as much as you might think.\u00a0\n\nQuadrigaCX monitor Ernst & Young suspects that the beleaguered exchange\u2019s late CEO, Gerald Cotten, may have been financing personal expenditures with company funds, and it is now recommending that the assets in Cotten\u2019s estate be placed under a preservation order.\nIn January, the exchange announced that it was insolvent, owing clients roughly $250 million CAD, after Cotten died of septic shock while honeymooning with his wife, Jennifer Robertson, in Jaipur, India. Since Cotten\u2019s death, the exchange filed for creditor protections in the Nova Scotia court system and the court has appointed a dual counsel in Miller Thompson and Cox & Palmer to represent clients who lost money to the exchange.\nThe exposure of a handful of opaque business practices, as well as the confirmation that one of QuadrigaCX\u2019s co-founders, Michael Patryn, has been convicted of cyber fraud, has stirred speculation as to whether the exchange was ever legitimate enough to redeem withdrawals.\nIn its fourth report as court monitor, Ernst & Young\u2019s latest findings are sure to give skeptics more reason to doubt.\nTo start, the report states that Robertson, who, along with her stepfather Thomas Beazley, has been acting on QuadrigaCX\u2019s behalf during the court proceedings, \u201cwould prefer not to continue acting as a director of the [exchange].\u201d This follows the news that QuadrigaCX\u2019s legal counsel, Stewart McKelvey, is stepping down from the case, though the firm continues to represent Robertson and the exchange while they search for new representation.\nWith the legal structure supporting QuadrigaCX under Canadian creditor protections crumbling, Ernst & Young recommends that QuadrigaCX file for bankruptcy, stating that the exchange\u2019s creditors \u201cwill benefit if the current CCAA [Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act] proceedings are converted to bankruptcy proceedings under the [Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act].\u201d Under this scenario, Ernst & Young would continue to watch over the proceedings as a trustee-in-bankruptcy.\nThe accounting firm, throughout the report, shows little confidence that court-directed creditor protection proceedings will efficiently resolve the case.\n\u201cGiven the present circumstances, the possibility that Quadriga will restructure and emerge from CCAA protection appears remote,\u201d Ernst & Young writes.\nConversely, it argues that bankruptcy proceedings would reduce costs and take away the need for the exchange to furnish a director and chief restructuring officer for the proceedings (as trustee, Ernst & Young would take over). With this friction removed, Ernst & Young would \u201chave additional investigatory powers without further relief from the Court that will be of assistance in the ongoing investigation of the business and affairs of the Applicants, including the right to compel production of documents and seek examination of relevant parties under oath.\u201d\nAmong other things, this would allow the firm to sell assets tied to the exchange\u2019s business. And given recent developments, this could mean more than the exchange itself (if it would have any buyers) and its domain name.\n\u201cDuring the course of the Monitor\u2019s investigation into Quadriga\u2019s business and affairs, the Monitor became aware of occurrences where the corporate and personal boundaries between Quadriga and its founder Gerald Cotten were not formally maintained, and it appeared to the Monitor that Quadriga funds may have been used to acquire assets held outside the corporate entity,\u201d the report reads. To stay any selling or shuffling of these assets, the monitor has proposed an asset preservation order so it can sort which assets were bought with what cash.\nThis assertion corroborates claims that Cotten\u2019s estate, which includes numerous luxury items and high-dollar properties, some of which have been liquidated by Robertson since executing Cotten\u2019s estate, was financed with company funds. Bitcoin Magazine has reported that clients have received withdrawals from an account linked to Robertson\u2019s real estate business.\nIf Ernst & Young collects significant evidence to confirm that QuadrigaCX\u2019s business funds were mixed with Cotten\u2019s personal expenditures, then acting as trustee, the firm could liquidate these assets under bankruptcy proceedings.\nQuadrigCX will need the cash if it has any hope of repaying the nine figures it owes creditors. Ernst & Young also notes in its report that the exchange\u2019s cash flow for March only \u201ctotalled $4,232,\u201d which is leagues away from the $6,413,728 it anticipated in bank drafts from the payment processors QuadrigCX used in place of proper banking relationships.\nThese bank notes hold just a sliver of the funds QuadrigaCX owes its clients. After contacting a handful of these (POSconnect, VoPay, Billerfy, Costodian, B.C. Ltd., N.B. Inc. and W21, to name a few), the monitor hasn\u2019t been able to retrieve money from any of these makeshift fiduciary partners.\nAs the report indicates, Ernst & Young\u2019s repeated solicitations have been met with either complete silence or defiance, as the processors have either ignored the letters or have asserted that they are entitled to withhold these funds per their agreements with QuadrigaCX.\nGiven \u201cthe various issues and delays that [Ernst & Young] has encountered\u201d when trying to retrieve creditor funds, the firm has requested an order to seek \u201crelief\u201d for these problems.\nAt the conclusion of the report, Ernst & Young requests that the court approve the orders to move the proceedings to bankruptcy, as well as the asset preservation and payment processor orders.", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 2}

Its goal is to bridge the communication gap between the Chinese community and the outside world. News, policy analysis... everything you want to know about crypto in China is here. \nThis article was originally published by 8btc and written by Chloe Jiang.\nThe price of bitcoin surged above $5,000 for the first time in 2019, bringing other major cryptocurrencies up with it. The collective market surged and broke the $140 billion mark for the first time in a week. Many investors who suffered from the crypto crash rekindled their hopes and now believe that the bull market is coming back. However, that may not be the case.\nFor example, Zhao Dong, one of China\u2019s most influential bitcoin billionaires and a famed over-the-counter (OTC) trader, holds the opposite view on this. Zhao repeated, \u201cThis is not a bull market\u201d triple times in a Weibo post.\n\n\nHe stated that the bear market would wear down people\u2019s patience and the bull market should come after most of the investors fail to HODL and leave the market.\nIn Zhao\u2019s argument, the bull market is defined as the stage when the actual market value exceeds the rational valuation driven by external funds, which is also known as the \u201cbubble stage.\u201d At that time, the bullish market performance will be spectacular, far beyond the current market performance, and last for a longer time.\nZhao believes that a bull market like that will come two years later.\nAccording to 8btc, the recent 20 to 50 percent daily gain will not last for long. Various indexes indicate that the current uptrend is driven by exchange-traded capital. It is more likely a market correction, a rational regression period, rather than a bull run.\nIt is just like the period from January to November 2015 when bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization increased from $2.5 billion to $4.58 billion. This is a rational regression period that consisted of the rebound period and the consolidation period.\n\n\n\nNow, the market cap has increased by 57.1 percent, a rebound from the bottom of $56.2 billion to $88.3 billion, which accounts for 83 percent of gains in the regression period of 2015.\nAccordingly, bitcoin has ended its bear trend and has entered the rational regression period. During this time, we may see frequent increases and declines in bitcoin\u2019s price within a small scope, which may last for a while, maybe 6 to 12 months or maybe even longer.", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 3}
{"title": "In Plain English: SEC Publishes Guidance on Tokens as Securities", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/plain-english-sec-publishes-guidance-tokens-securities/", "birthday": "Apr 3, 2019  2:59 PM EST", "date": "2019-04-03 19:59:00", "content": "Colin is an associate editor and staff writer for Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0 He's proud to call Nashville his home, where he lives with his family and doesn't eat hot chicken as much as you might think.\u00a0\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has published an investment contract framework for digital assets, which is intended to give crypto companies guidance as to whether a cryptocurrency is a security. It\u2019s the first major culminating work of the SEC\u2019s FinHub initiative, a strategic group the commission launched in October 2018 to liaise with fintech and cryptocurrency companies and work toward more substantial regulatory guidance.\nThis concrete framework comes after years of guidance by enforcement, wherein the SEC prosecuted ICO operators and token companies after their token sales to make examples of the more egregious and unscrupulous opportunists who took advantage of the 2016-2017 bull run.\nWith the new 13-page framework, cryptocurrency companies will now have a clear touchstone for testing whether or not the SEC would qualify an asset that they offer as a security. But, like SEC enforcement that has targeted ICO orchestrators and broker/dealers in the past, the guidance is not confined to token projects alone \u2014 it\u2019s also applicable to crypto exchanges, custody organizations, hedge funds, marketing firms and \u201cother professional services.\u201d\n\u201cAs financial technologies, methods of capital formation, and market structures continue to evolve, market participants should be aware that they may be conducting activities that fall within our jurisdiction,\u201d according to an SEC press release on the new report. \u201cThe framework is not intended to be an exhaustive overview of the law, but rather, an analytical tool to help market participants assess whether the federal securities laws apply to the offer, sale, or resale of a particular digital asset.\u201d\nThe Thick of It\nSo when will a cryptocurrency offering be considered a security?\nThe document kicks off with reference to the Howey Test, a litmus test for what defines an investment contract that was established by a 1946 Supreme Court decision. Notably, the test looks not only at the asset being offered or sold but how it is offered or sold. This implies most saliently to ICOs, as the SEC has been keen to remind investors and entrepreneurs for years now, including its insistence that simply calling something a \u201cutility token\u201d doesn\u2019t exculpate it from a security status.\n\u201cUnder the Howey test, an \u2018investment contract\u2019 exists when there is the investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others,\u201d according to the guidance. \u201cWhether a particular digital asset at the time of its offer or sale satisfies the Howey test depends on the specific facts and circumstances.\u201d\nThe document then goes on to identify the three primary conditions that constitute an investment contract, namely: that money/value is invested (whether as fiat or crypto), that a \u201ccommon enterprise\u201d is present (i.e., that some central entity offers the contract and shares a common interest with its purchasers) and that there\u2019s an expectation of profit or return.\nAs the first two are pretty cut and dry (and the document states that, in its experience, the SEC believes most token sales satisfy these two criteria), the framework unpacks the specific conditions and nuances of the third point pretty thoroughly.\nBasically, the document states that a token or sale is at risk of being deemed a security if its purchasers rely on the efforts of an \u201cactive participant\u201d (i.e., a centralized entity) and if there is a \u201creasonable expectation of profit.\u201d In essence, if a manager, company or some centralized entity directs the development of a cryptocurrency and is primarily responsible for its success, then it\u2019s a security. By extension, if token holders expect the active participant to accelerate price through its managerial efforts \u2014 and if the active participant makes a promise of ownership in the project/prospect of gain and, to put it bluntly, shills the project to stimulate price appreciation \u2014 then it\u2019s a security.\nTo the SEC, token price appreciation does not equate profit under the Howey Test, because price appreciation for a speculative asset comes from market forces instead of actual company operations and revenue flow.\nWith all of this in mind, the document confirmed what the SEC has already said when it cleared Bitcoin and Ethereum from securities status. Essentially, if a project is sufficiently decentralized, has a clear working product and the value of its token is tied to utility and not expectation of profit, then it\u2019s not a security.\nSo, TLDR: if interest in your token is driven by speculation and its development is centralized, then it\u2019s a security.", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 3}

This unfolding price scenario should not immediately be ruled out as a repeat of what happened in 2017. However, as the market reaction seems to be positive so far (given that bitcoin sits at $5,214 at the time of this writing), recent developments in the crypto space could be working to make today\u2019s change different from 2017\u2019s movement.\nInvestors\nFrom active bitcoin wallets to those joining the crypto community through the likes of the r/Bitcoin subreddit, the number of new people in the space has risen. In 2017, the price breakout over $5,000 was one of the reasons many new investors joined the bitcoin train. Whether seeing it at $5,000 again for the first time after a year of slowdown would trigger the same 2017 effect is hard to determine. After more than a year in a critical bear market, price support for bitcoin has been built at over $3,000.\nSegregated Witness (SegWit)\nFor the first time, daily median transactions per block, excluding Coinbase activity for SegWit-based transactions, reached over 1,000 on March 30, 2019. Activated for Bitcoin in August 2017 (on Litecoin in May 2017), the SegWit scaling upgrade was meant to help change the way data is stored on the network. Proposed as a solution to the scaling problem, SegWit would enable Bitcoin to process a greater throughput without having to change the block size. Its uptake has been slow as some key exchanges are yet to run it on their platforms. According to BitcoinVisuals, the highest number of SegWit transactions reached at the end of 2017 was 294.\nLightning Network (LN)\nIt\u2019s been touted as one of the best things happening in the cryptocurrency space today, especially since the start of Q1 2019. The Lightning Network is an off-chain scaling solution for Bitcoin that uses smart contract functionality of the blockchain to enable instant micropayments across a network of participants. Real-time statistics show that Lightning transactions have now surpassed $5 million in capacity. Its use is expected to improve bitcoin adoption, including for merchants who seek to accept the cryptocurrency as a means of payment. As in 2017, the Lightning Network was not available in the space.\nInstitutional Interest\nFrom applications for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) to traditional investment companies, institutional interest in the ecosystem has risen since 2017. Major companies like Fidelity, Bakkt and even Facebook have expressed plans to venture into the crypto space later this year. Their entry \u2014 coming as next year\u2019s Bitcoin block reward halving draws closer \u2014 is expected to boost the state of the crypto market while helping to attract more mainstream investors.\nUptake Shifting from China to South America\nUnlike in 2017 when the shots seemed to be called from China, difficult economic situations in some South American countries today are forcing people in the region to develop a penchant for transacting cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Crypto adoption in these countries has taken off as the ease of access has increased.\nIncreasing awareness and need for bitcoin, despite less enhanced infrastructure around internet use, is bringing substantial growth. South American countries like Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Argentina and Mexico have been growing organically in their use of bitcoin.\nThe People\u2019s Bank of China worked to bring down bitcoin trading below 1 percent of global levels through various measures, including placing a ban on direct trading. Hence, the wider Chinese involvement in bitcoin has reduced drastically, though mining is still a core advantage.", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 4}

But what isn\u2019t an opinion is the fact that the Chinese government had nothing to do with these ratings, despite the popular perception that it does.\nThe government doesn\u2019t sponsor the rankings, it doesn\u2019t endorse them and it sure as hell doesn\u2019t make them. You have to understand this in order to rationalize the congratulatory and reinforced cognitive bias that TRON, NEO and EOS bagholders must feel when these ratings come out.\nThe latest iteration of CCID\u2019s \u201cGlobal Public Blockchain Technology Assessment Index\u201d ranks EOS as the number one project, followed by TRON, Ethereum and BitShares.

But not to worry because, again, the ratings aren\u2019t really coming from the Chinese government but from an independent ratings agency affiliated with the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.\nStill, whether a government or private entity, the source of the information doesn\u2019t change the underlying point: these ratings (and the projects they tout) are a worthless assessment of the crypto industry\u2019s frontrunning assets.\nNot Government Vetted at All\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that CCID has released cryptocurrency ratings and, by extension, it\u2019s not the first time that these have been erroneously attributed to the Chinese government.

In Mandarin, the company\u2019s name (\u201c\u8d5b\u8fea,\u201d which translates to \u201cSadiiWang\u201d) has no reference to China in it.\nThe misconception might also stem from the fact that when the first ratings were introduced in the summer of 2018, Chinese media framed the ratings as coming from China\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. In a South China Morning Post article entitled \u201cChina\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology to publish ratings for blockchain projects \u2014 including bitcoin,\u201d for example, journalist Amanda Lee writes that the CCID operates \u201cunder\u201d the industry while also calling it a \u201cgovernment-backed institute.\u201d\nSaying that the CCID is \u201cunder\u201d or \u201cbacked by\u201d China\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology is not inaccurate, it is a misinterpretation and misrepresentation. Reporting that this support means that all of the institute's research is straight from the government\u2019s mouth would be akin to saying that scientific research funded by U.S. government grants are the product of the U.S. Office of Science.\n\u201cThe part about being state-owned is overplayed by the western audience; they don't have any government structure in place dictating what they do or don't do on a day-to-day basis,\u201d Ben Yorke, an American blockchain and technology blogger living in China, told me. \u201cIn China there are over 150,000 SOEs [state-owned-enterprise] that can claim 'the backing' of the government.\u201d\nOn Twitter, Yorke opined how western audiences reacted to the ratings (yet again) because, as he told me over our DM conversation, \u201cthe majority of people with experience in China would ignore a list like this.\u201d\nYorke contacted the curator of the list and explained that \u201cthe guy I spoke with on the phone straight up said that the rankings are their independent thing \u2026 [they] aren't endorsed by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which is what we'd be looking for if the rankings were more official.\u201d\nOne glance at CCID\u2019s Baidu Baike page (what amounts to China\u2019s wiki) and it\u2019s clear that the company is an independent media and IT consultant firm.\nNo Equal Footing\nEven if the rankings were \u201cmore official,\u201d it\u2019d be hard to take them any more seriously. But since they aren\u2019t official, we\u2019ll focus on why we should take them less seriously.\nFor one, \u201cCCID's services are opt-in. They don't rank everyone, which seriously throws into question the integrity of the ratings system,\u201d Yorke told me. He knows this because he asked the team at VeChain, a Chinese blockchain project which he has close ties to, why it wasn\u2019t included and it said that it decided not to take part.\nThis opt-in model also raises questions about the rank of many companies in the top 10. How, for example, could a project that has never been on the rankings before suddenly make an appearance in the top five? I think it probably started playing ball. And given the open prevalence of bribery in many Chinese business practices, it\u2019s possible to speculate that some form of pay to play was part of the process.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to verify, but this is China \u2014 paying for favors is pretty run of the mill here. I would be shocked if they didn't have deals in place with some of the projects on the list,\u201d Yorke told me when I asked if my assumption was fair.\nAt any rate, given the opt-in nature of these ratings, it should come as no surprise, then, to see that six out of the top 10 projects are predominantly Chinese \u2014 a Chinese company showing some indications of favoritism toward its compatriots.\nAnd this is getting to the crux of it. If these ratings were evaluating the robustness, security, decentralization and value of a public chain \u2014 tenets that many in the community would uphold as positives for what would give a blockchain its underlying value \u2014 there\u2019s no reason why bitcoin should be 15th behind a slew of dubious competitors.\nWhy Are These Rankings Dubious?\nCritics would point out that TRON has been accused of plagiarizing its white paper while its founder, Justin Sun, is notorious for throwing money around to hype the project (including during a botched Twitter giveaway); EOS ran a year-long ICO that netted $1 billion in contributions but, to date, can be seen as little more than a \u201cglorified cloud server\u201d (which is hardly decentralized); NEO, like TRON and EOS, isn\u2019t decentralized either and relies on the NEO foundation largely for project development; and Steem\u2019s token supply was subject to a staggering 80 percent pre-mine (!).\nAs for the rest, the list is populated by projects that most people outside of the shitcoin speculator milieu have never heard of, like NULS, Ontology and GX Chain. The bottom line: these projects are judged on criteria (like \u201ccreativity\u201d) that have little to do with what many cypherpunks and cryptographers would deem valuable when examining the value of a public chain.\nWhile \u201cBasic-tech\u201d [sic] and \u201cApplicability\u201d are also among these criteria, there\u2019s no rationale given behind what makes most of these projects superior or even relevant in the category of public blockchains. How, for example, can you praise the underlying technology of some of these projects as being the best in the blockchain industry when centralized ones like EOS, TRON and NEO can hardly be considered blockchains at all?\nAll in all, we can hardly trust these ratings to be objective or even professionally curated. It\u2019s the same problem that people have with Weiss Ratings\u2019 own cryptocurrency grades. In its latest iteration, Weiss gave EOS, XRP and Bitcoin the top three spots, respectively. The discrepancy (besides EOS) between the two lists alone should be enough to dismiss these lists as ill-informed and, really, a reckless strategy for evaluating investments. Why would we listen to people who have no experience in cryptography telling us which cryptocurrency is the best investment?\nUnfortunately, the practice of rating investments is deeply embedded in the current financial system, so it was more or less inevitable for this to seep into the crypto industry as well. Suffice it to say, the hazards are all the same and the writing has long been on the wall for the dangers that this practice represents. Case in point: the triple-A-rated securities and debt instruments that were ranked by credit ratings agencies played a big role in the Great Recession and the 2008-2009 subprime mortgage crisis.\nSatoshi built Bitcoin to escape these structures, not to replicate them. So if you want my two sats, don\u2019t pay these ratings any mind and if they affirm your crypto biases, it might be constructive to look elsewhere to evaluate your investments. Because these rankings are not coming from the Chinese government (and it wouldn\u2019t matter even if they did). They're only coming from legacy institutions who didn\u2019t care about bitcoin until it hit $20,000.\nColin is an associate editor and staff writer for Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0 He's proud to call Nashville his home, where he lives with his family and doesn't eat hot chicken as much as you might think.\u00a0\n", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 3}

She currently works as an operations associate at BTC Inc.\nThe CoolWallet S, made by CoolBit X, combines hot and cold storage solutions, blending the mobility afforded by software wallets with the enhanced security features offered by hardware wallets. Branded as the \u201ceveryday wallet\u201d for crypto users, the CoolWallet S is designed to be used on-the-go, allowing its users to track their investments, send and receive assets and instantly exchange currencies through Bluetooth-enabled, dual-device technology.\nThe CoolWallet S retails at around $99. Unlike other hardware wallets on the market, its sleek design boasts not only the exact dimensions of a credit card, but also the durability of one. It claims to be waterproof, flexible and temperature resistant, as well as tamperproof.\nIt offers a rechargeable battery that should last about a month and something called \u201c2+1-factor authentication\u201d \u2014 access through two devices plus biometric identification. Users can pair up to three devices with the wallet through an extra-secure Bluetooth connection.\nThe CoolWallet S supports a wide variety of cryptocurrencies, including BTC, BCH, BNB, ETH, LTC, USDT, XRP, ZEN and ERC-20 tokens. It also integrates Changelly for instant currency swaps.\nUsers interact with the device through a button located on its right-hand side and an e-paper screen, which displays the device\u2019s remaining battery and a Bluetooth indicator when paired with something, allowing you to toggle between currencies to view the assets currently stored on it.\nConfiguration and Use\nOverall setup should take about 10 to 20 minutes and seems fairly intuitive, with clear attention paid to the user experience through step-by-step instruction.\nOnce you\u2019ve downloaded the CoolBitX Crypto app to your mobile device and enabled your device\u2019s Bluetooth, you can connect to your CoolWallet S by selecting the serial number that matches that of your card (found in the left-hand corner). A one-time password will appear on the e-paper that you then input into your mobile device to pair.\n\n\n\nOnce paired, you will see an option to either recover or create your wallet, which is done by generating a new random set of seeds (with options of 12-, 18- or 24-word sets) through either the card or the app. You\u2019ll then need to verify your seed phrase \u2014 the most tedious part of setting up any hardware wallet.\nYou can pair up to three devices to your CoolWallet S by inputting the pairing password (located under the \u201cpair\u201d category of the app\u2019s settings menu) to each new device when prompted, although the \u201callow new pairing\u201d option must be enabled in order to add new devices. You can just as easily remove unwanted devices via a \u201cdevice list\u201d category in the settings.\nAlthough there is no PIN needed to access your funds, you can transact only if your CoolWallet S card is turned on and paired with your device. This is also where the 2+1-factor authentication comes in.\n(For full step-by-step instructions, check out the CoolWallet S user manual.)\nCoolWallet App\nUsing the CoolWallet app is pretty intuitive. In the wallet tab, you can view your funds and easily add one of the cryptocurrencies supported by the wallet to the display by configuring the \u201ccoin display\u201d option in the settings. Additionally, the wallet is fully integrated with Changelly, enabling trading capabilities within the safety of your cold storage wallet.\nAmong the best features is the sliding transaction fee bar that allows you to increase or decrease the fee in accordance with desired transaction confirmation time. This sort of option is becoming increasingly common among crypto wallets.\nSecurity\nAlmost all exchanges and wallet solutions at this point, and even your most basic password-protected accounts like Gmail, offer an auxiliary layer of security through 2-factor authentication (2FA). Seldom addressed, however, is the fact that many users still set up their 2FA for various accounts on a device that is also used to access their crypto assets via an exchange or a software wallet.\nIt may be unlikely that a hacker could orchestrate a cyberattack that would prove successful, but SIM card fraud, or \u201cSIM swapping,\u201d remains a threat to token holders whose 2FA is enabled through a single device.\nThe CoolWallet S\u2019s approach to multifactor authentication protects against this vulnerability through dual-device authentication with an optional biometric authentication layer.\nThe CoolWallet S\u2019s use of Bluetooth as the channel through which the wallet enables access to funds in the app may make some people wary. After all, when Bluetooth was created in the \u201990s, it wasn\u2019t exactly designed with security in mind. So how do you know your funds are truly secure when transmitted using this technology?\nThe Bluetooth communication between the CoolWallet S and smart devices is encrypted using military-grade Advanced Encryption Standard 256, or AES-256. In terms of data security, AES-256 is not only an internationally recognized algorithm, but it\u2019s also used by the U.S. Department of Defense, the National Security Agency and other government entities for file storage. Even with extensive public and private testing, cracking an encrypted key of 256-bit length by brute force has not yet been proven possible. AES-256 is typically considered \u201cbest practice\u201d when it comes to data encryption.\n\n\nAdditionally, the transactions occur in mere milliseconds, so the probability of someone gaining access to the encrypted data being transmitted between your public and private keys that would enable them to successfully perform a side-channel attack is extremely unlikely. The Bluetooth connection itself will only be supported if your wallet is powered on and maintained within 10 meters of your device, meaning that the attacker would also have to be within the same range.\nThe private keys for a CoolWallet S are stored in the CCEAL5+ certified secure element. External communication of the secure element is minimal, providing an added layer of security, and all other parts of the microware are subordinate to the secure element. So, not only is all data stored offline, but all necessary computations are performed by the secure element, meaning only non-sensitive data, or the results of these calculations, are transmitted between the card and your device.\nWhen evaluating the security of the key itself, it is important to consider the \u201crandomness\u201d of its random number generator (RNG). In the case of the CoolWallet S, because a hardware RNG is used, it is considered a \u201ctrue\u201d RNG.\nThe patented \u201ccold compression\u201d design of the hardware is supposed to ensure that no one can gain access to the secure element without it being extremely obvious.\nThe CoolBitX team said that it budgeted for extensive amounts of third-party security auditing. Additionally, the team said that \u201cwhite hat\u201d hackers from wallet.fail \u2014 computer security experts who conduct penetration testing \u2014 have tested the CoolWallet S and haven\u2019t indicated any vulnerabilities \u2014 something they are usually eager to share.\nPros and Cons\nFor someone new to crypto, navigating the rather complex wallet solutions can often be daunting. The CoolWallet S offers a user-friendly product option.\nFor any crypto wallet, whether it be hardware or software, security remains a primary concern among consumers, and of course, no product can promise 100 percent infallibility. Having said that, the security features in the CoolWallet S appear to be robust, and the fact that extensive amounts of penetration testing haven\u2019t been able to identify security vulnerabilities is promising.\nHowever, as with virtually any product, there are some cons to consider.\nWhile the need to charge your device on a monthly basis isn\u2019t terribly inconvenient, temporary loss of access to your funds would be inconvenient if, say, your card dies and you\u2019ve lost your adapter. You can\u2019t exactly pick up a replacement adapter at your local convenience store, so being able to cut the cord completely or compatibility with other charger types would be a nice feature.\nWhen sending and receiving transactions, you\u2019re required to verify the transaction details on the card\u2019s e-paper display. However, not all of the alphanumeric characters in the set are easy to decipher. It\u2019s not a deal breaker, but it might take a minute to familiarize yourself with the symbols.\nLastly, the code isn\u2019t yet open source, though there are plans to make it so in the near future.", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 3}

If it maintains this pace, in another 10 years, it will surpass all competition.\u201d\nFor so long, global payments have been championed by platforms like Visa, Mastercard and PayPal, who offer seamless, if flawed, payment options for individuals and companies.\nIn its report, DataLight wrote that while Bitcoin still has fewer users than established payment networks like Visa and Mastercard, these two in particular were established over half a century ago.\nCurrently, there are about 25 million Bitcoin wallets in the world, per DataLight, while the total number of debit and credit cards in circulation amounts to over 5 billion.\nHowever, according to DataLight, the next few years will bring about advancements in the Bitcoin network that will make the world\u2019s most popular digital asset more useful to mainstream consumers.\nDataLight also pointed out that Bitcoin offers significantly lower fees on individual transactions conducted. And, the firm pointed out, while Bitcoin has about 10,000 active nodes, the numbers of data centers being managed by Mastercard and Visa are 89 and 119 respectively.\nThe researchers didn\u2019t shy away from the shortcomings of the cryptocurrency, particularly around its rate of transactions processed per second. Currently, Bitcoin can only process seven transactions per second, compared with Visa\u2019s 65,000 transactions per second.

This accusation is mostly thrown at Bitcoin by proponents of altcoins and those who have supported various Bitcoin hard fork attempts in the past.\nOf course, this is an oversimplification of the Bitcoin community. Crypto Twitter, which is the main hub of online cryptocurrency conversations these days, does not make up anywhere near the entire Bitcoin user base. When people talk about the Bitcoin community being toxic, they\u2019re mostly complaining that some Bitcoin users were mean to them on the internet.\nHaving said that, there is a logical reason that some Bitcoin users get extremely angry at certain members of the greater crypto asset community.\nWhat\u2019s With the Hostility, Man?\nBitcoin is defined by a set of protocol rules. It is these rules, which are effectively set in stone (see: Satoshi), that provide the underlying value proposition of Bitcoin. Bitcoin\u2019s most important feature is not necessarily its specific monetary policy (the 21 million cap) or any of the other specific rules. Instead, the fact that the rules are extremely difficult to change is the key selling point (I\u2019ve written a longer explanation of this here).\nOf course, people could decide to abandon Bitcoin and go use something else (an altcoin or some forked version of Bitcoin), but that would necessitate the creation of a new network.\nWith this in mind, it should become clear why attempts to change the rules of Bitcoin through social attacks are met with disgust. Attempting to use social clout or \u201cthought leadership\u201d in an effort to push users over to a new network with different rules undermines the underlying value proposition of this technology.\n\n\nWhile we're on the topic of #SegWit2x, it's important to point out that one of the key issues with the plan was that it was presented as a decree rather than a proposal. Kind of goes against the whole reason of why we're here in the first place.\u2014 Kyle Torpey (@kyletorpey) March 27, 2019\n\n\nIf something new were to overtake Bitcoin through pressure from a consortium of influential nodes on the network, then what\u2019s to stop that from happening again with the new coin of the moment? Perhaps more importantly, will the new coin stick to the core ethos of Bitcoin as an apolitical store of value and medium of exchange? If Bitcoin is susceptible to this sort of persuasion from influential players in the space, then it\u2019s unclear how different it is from the traditional financial system or non-cryptocurrencies like Ripple\u2019s XRP.\nBitcoin proved resistant to this sort of persuasion in the case of the New York Agreement, in which a consortium of economically relevant Bitcoin nodes and miners effectively got together to say some new fork of Bitcoin with a larger block size limit (which increases the cost of operating a full node) was going to be the new, official version of Bitcoin.\nIt\u2019s not a stretch to call the New York Agreement an attack on the whole point of Bitcoin existing in the first place. Various businesses built on top of Bitcoin were putting their own needs ahead of the viability of bitcoin as an apolitical money. Perhaps more importantly, they issued their plan as a decree rather than a proposal.\nYes, those companies had users of their own to represent, but it\u2019s possible that the power of users focused on the store-of-value use case were ignored in favor of those who put greater emphasis on the use of bitcoin as a medium of exchange.\nOn Twitter, some signers of the New York Agreement referred to those who shared criticisms associated with the 2x portion of SegWit2x as toxic individuals.\nAt the time, I wrote about how the creation of a federated sidechain may be a more sensible approach to the need to free up block space on the base of the Bitcoin blockchain. But the SegWit2x train had already left the station.\nThankfully, the failure of SegWit2x ended up being nothing more than an illustration of the difficulties associated with pulling off social attacks on Bitcoin. The whole ordeal added credibility to the \u201cdigital gold\u201d meme that had long been associated with bitcoin.\nBitcoin\u2019s current consensus rules are the Schelling point when people are unsure of what to do in the case of a network split, which makes it difficult for hard-forking changes to happen without widespread consensus. If there is going to be some kind of hard fork of the Bitcoin network, there better be a damned good reason to do so, such as a critical bug in consensus-related software. Otherwise, the \u201ctoxic trolls\u201d are incentivized to respond to your attack on Bitcoin\u2019s apolitical nature.\nWith all of this in mind, the question must be asked: Who is really the toxic part of the Bitcoin community? Those who attempted to push users to a new network and call it \u201cBitcoin\u201d or those who said some mean words on the internet?\nThis is not to say every signatory of the New York Agreement is toxic. Some, such as Xapo CEO and PayPal board member Wences Casares, may have simply made a mistake, while others, such as F2Pool\u2019s Chun Wang, may have never had any intention to run the code associated with the hard-forking portion of the agreement.\nIf You Break Consensus, You\u2019re Gonna Have a Bad Time\nAlthough the technical details of Bitcoin get a lot of attention, the system is mostly built on game theory. The \u201ctoxic maximalism\u201d that is sometimes associated with Bitcoin has its roots in the structure of incentives originally put into place by Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin users are effectively incentivized to attack anyone who attempts any sort of social attack on the system.\nWhen certain individuals or entities push for a noncompatible change to Bitcoin and the \u201ctoxic maximalists\u201d respond in anger, it is human nature for those pushing for the incompatible changes to get stuck in their position and become unwilling to admit they were wrong to make the proposal in the first place.\nThe original mistake was to advocate for breaking consensus without proper support, but that led to a series of other mistakes, which were avoidable.\nThe block size wars were a valuable lesson for everybody, but they were an especially costly lesson for those who simply could not admit they had made a mistake and continued on their crusade via the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) altcoin.\nAt the end of the day, those who saw the error of their ways and didn\u2019t go down the path of Bitcoin Cash are better for it. After all, it\u2019s beneficial for everyone if we\u2019re all using the same money. The fact that you can transact with your worst enemies via the Bitcoin network is a big part of apolitical money.\nNote: This article was partially inspired by ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees\u2019s recent appearance on What Bitcoin Did and BTC Inc CEO David Bailey\u2019s recent appearance on the Stephan Livera Podcast.

With Thor Turbo, Bitrefill expects the process to go much faster. The startup claimed that users can \"instantly hop onto the network and make purchases from anywhere in the world without delay.\u201d\nBeyond the time savings, Thor Turbo users can also choose to have their channel pre-loaded with a spendable bitcoin balance. For those who don't have Bitcoin in their wallets, Thor Turbo has a feature that converts other cryptocurrencies into spendable bitcoin on the Lightning Network. Currently, it supports ether, dash, litecoin and dogecoin conversions.\nPer the release, Thor Turbo will be an optional upgrade to users and Bitrefill will continue to provide support for non-Turbo Thor channels. Carvalho said Turbo channels would cost as much as non-Turbo channels but that the fees for the original Thor service have been reduced.\nAdoption of the Lightning Network has grown tremendously since it was first introduced. As of press time, the network supports a total of 7,816 nodes with a collective network capacity of 1,076.03 BTC (worth about $5.35 million).\n\u201cWe're aiming to release several more Lightning-based services this year, demonstrating how businesses can make money and support Bitcoin infrastructure at the same time,\" Carvalho concluded.", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 5}

It\u2019s been reported as Canada\u2019s largest-ever bitcoin forfeiture.\nIn 2015, local authorities seized the dealer\u2019s laptop and the BTC tokens (worth about $65,885 at the time) were found, according to a report by the Toronto Star. The dealer, Matthew Phan, pleaded guilty to the charges of possessing illegal substances, including ketamine, cocaine and PCP, and attempting to import a gun, in December 2018.\nAt a forfeiture hearing last month, Phan begged the court to allow him to keep half of the cryptocurrencies discovered, saying that he didn\u2019t use all of them for illegal purposes.\n\u201cPhan, who fought the forfeiture, argued not all of the bitcoins were used for nefarious purposes and that some were used to buy and sell gold,\u201d per the report. \u201cAs well, he claimed he was selling the cryptocurrency itself on various exchanges.\u201d\nIn the ruling, Superior Court Justice Jane Kelly remarked that while she didn\u2019t doubt Phan was a legitimate crypto trader, it was difficult for her to believe his explanation for why he had so much bitcoin in his possession.\n\u201cThere is overwhelming evidence to suggest that Mr. Phan was using the dark markets to purchase illegal items such as firearms and silencers,\u201d Kelly said in her statement. \u201cIt is clear from the evidence found during searches, particularly of his condominium unit, that he was conducting a large sales operation of illegal narcotics.\u201d\nHowever, in line with her belief that not all his assets were intended for criminal purposes, the judge allowed Phan to keep 7.23 BTC (worth about $36,371).", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 5}
{"title": "Infographic: A Map of Bitcoin Forks", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/infographic-map-bitcoin-forks/", "birthday": "Apr 8, 2019  10:41 AM EST", "date": "2019-04-08 15:41:00", "content": "This infographic provides a schematic overview of the main Bitcoin-related \u201cforks\u201d that can happen and shows the most important forks that have happened. It does not provide an overview of all forks that have happened.\nWhat Are Bitcoin Forks?\nThe word \u201cfork\u201d is somewhat confusing because there are different kinds of \u201cforks\u201d that mean very different things.\nCodebase Fork\nA codebase fork is a copy of the code of a software implementation. A codebase fork typically makes tweaks to the original codebase. In the context of Bitcoin, codebase forks can be entirely compatible with the Bitcoin protocol, they can cause an unintentional blockchain fork, or they can establish a whole new cryptocurrency.\nBlockchain Fork\nA blockchain fork happens when a blockchain branches into two versions of transaction history. This can happen for a number of reasons, can be expected or unexpected, and can, depending on the circumstances, lead to a number of outcomes, ranging from a single orphaned block to a whole new cryptocurrency.\nHard Fork\nA hard fork is a type of protocol upgrade that loosens or removes rules. If all users upgrade, a hard fork doesn\u2019t cause a blockchain fork. Especially in the context of Bitcoin, some argue that unless all users upgrade, the \u201cupgraded\u201d protocol shouldn\u2019t be called a hard fork at all, but a new cryptocurrency or \u201cforkcoin.\u201d\nSoft Fork\nA soft fork is a type of protocol upgrade that tightens or adds rules. Soft fork upgrades can cause blockchain forks, but enforcement by a majority of hash power guarantees eventual convergence on the same transaction history. A miner-activated soft fork (MASF) is triggered by hash power, while a user-activated soft fork (UASF) is triggered by users.\nGray Areas\nWhile the different terms sound clear enough, the reality of Bitcoin is complex. The difference between hard and soft forks is not always obvious, and sometimes it\u2019s not even clear what should be considered a protocol upgrade at all. To this day, there are cases where experts disagree on how certain events should be categorized, and politically motivated attempts to rewrite history make some of this even more confusing.\n\n\n\nInfographic Key\nBitcoin Core\nBitcoin launched in 2009 when Satoshi Nakamoto released the first Bitcoin codebase. Then, it was simply called \u201cBitcoin\u201d (or, more specifically, \u201cBitcoin 0.1.0\u201d for that first release). Later generations of the same codebase were rebranded as \u201cBitcoin Core\u201d and are sometimes also referred to as the \u201cSatoshi client.\u201d\nRegular Blockchain Forks\nWhen two or more miners find valid blocks at the same time, the Bitcoin blockchain forks into two branches. By design, these forks resolve as soon as one branch becomes longer, at which point the shorter branch is abandoned (\u201corphaned\u201d). This happens regularly, even today.\nFirst Soft Fork\nBitcoin\u2019s first soft fork protocol upgrade disabled a protocol feature, OP_RETURN. This was technically a UASF, but in these early days it was really just Satoshi Nakamoto dictating the protocol rules. The upgrade did not cause a blockchain fork.\nFirst Hard Fork\nArguably, Bitcoin\u2019s first hard fork protocol upgrade added a new feature, OP_NOP, and was also dictated by Satoshi Nakamoto. Not everyone agrees this upgrade was in fact a hard fork, however. Either way, it did not cause a blockchain fork.\nUnintentional Blockchain Fork\nUnintentional blockchain forks happen when different parts of the Bitcoin network are seeing different transaction histories and the situation doesn\u2019t resolve automatically. These types of blockchain forks are usually caused by software bugs or other technical problems, and are among the biggest short-term failures Bitcoin can experience. Luckily, it has happened only two or three times in Bitcoin\u2019s history, and each time it was resolved through community coordination without much damage.\nBitcoin Knots\nBitcoin Knots is an example of a codebase fork of Bitcoin Core. A codebase fork is a copy of the code, and does not need to cause a blockchain fork. Indeed, Bitcoin Knots is designed to remain compatible with Bitcoin Core \u2014 it just offers different features.\nLibbitcoin\nLibbitcoin is an example of a complete reimplementation of the Bitcoin protocol in a different codebase. It is not a codebase fork of Bitcoin Core, but it is designed to remain compatible with Bitcoin Core nonetheless.\nFirst MASF\nThe P2SH upgrade was arguably the first MASF, although later MASFs used a more purely hash power\u2013based upgrade mechanism. It did not cause a blockchain fork.\nThe BIP148 Client\nThe BIP148 client is another example of a codebase fork of Bitcoin Core. The BIP148 client was tweaked to enforce a UASF, in order to activate the Segregated Witness protocol upgrade. It could have become incompatible with Bitcoin Core and other Bitcoin clients.\nBitcoin ABC\nBitcoin ABC is yet another example of a codebase fork of Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin ABC, however, was tweaked to ensure it would become incompatible with Bitcoin Core and other Bitcoin clients at a certain point in time.\nBitcoin ABC Forks Away from Bitcoin to Create \u201cBitcoin Cash\u201d\nOn August 1, 2017, Bitcoin ABC became incompatible with Bitcoin Core and other Bitcoin clients. In doing so, it created a new cryptocurrency, called \u201cBitcoin Cash.\u201d (While not shown in this infographic, Bitcoin Cash now also consists of several clients \u2014 not just Bitcoin ABC.)\nBTC1\nBTC1 was also a codebase fork of Bitcoin Core tweaked to ensure it would become incompatible with Bitcoin Core and other Bitcoin clients. However, BTC1 had the specific purpose of deploying a hard fork upgrade for a new Bitcoin protocol, \u201cSegwit2x.\u201d (Put differently, the goal was to have all Bitcoin users switch to the Segwit2x protocol and consider this protocol \u201cBitcoin.\u201d)\nFirst UASF\nIf the BIP148 client had not gained sufficient support, it would have forked away from Bitcoin to create a new cryptocurrency. However, because enough miners upgraded their systems, the BIP148 client remained compatible with other Bitcoin clients. Many see this protocol upgrade as the first \u201creal\u201d UASF: not dictated by developers, but born out of a grassroots user movement.\nBitcoin Clashic\nA new Bitcoin ABC release was designed to hard fork to an upgraded Bitcoin Cash protocol. Most Bitcoin Cash users indeed upgraded and claimed the name \u201cBitcoin Cash\u201d for this new protocol. However, a small minority of users chose to continue using the first Bitcoin Cash protocol (mostly as a joke) and adopted a new name for this cryptocurrency: \u201cBitcoin Clashic.\u201d\nBitcoin Core (Not the Implementation)\nIn early 2018, most of the Bitcoin Clashic community adopted a codebase fork of the Bitcoin Clashic client, called Bitcoin Core Sq. Incompatible with existing Bitcoin Clashic clients, this once again created a new cryptocurrency, with the intentionally confusing name \u201cBitcoin Core.\u201d Bitcoin Core Sq and/or the Bitcoin Core cryptocurrency are incompatible with the Bitcoin Core software client and/or the Bitcoin protocol. While Bitcoin Clashic lived on for some time as well, it has now been abandoned entirely (largely in favor of Bitcoin Core).\nSegwit2x Fails\nFor a number of reasons, BTC1 was adopted by almost no one. Not only did it fail to \u201cupgrade\u201d the Bitcoin protocol, it did not even continue as a new cryptocurrency.\nBitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond and Dozens of Fork Coins\nAfter Bitcoin ABC had set a relatively successful precedent of creating Bitcoin Cash through a blockchain fork, a number of so-called \u201cforkcoins\u201d launched. Where Bitcoin Cash was born out of a long-standing disagreement within the Bitcoin community, other forkcoins generally considered a blockchain fork to simply be a good way of launching a new coin.\nBitcoin SV\nBitcoin Satoshi\u2019s Vision (Bitcoin SV) is a codebase fork of Bitcoin ABC, but tweaked to ensure that it would become incompatible with the Bitcoin Cash protocol at a certain point in time.\nBitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV Split\nIn 2018, a disagreement within the Bitcoin Cash community had Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV both split off from the existing Bitcoin Cash protocol. The Bitcoin ABC side came out of the split bigger in just about every way and claimed the name \u201cBitcoin Cash,\u201d though it is now also referred to as \u201cBitcoin Cash ABC.\u201d The Bitcoin SV side of the split claimed the name \u201cBitcoin SV.\u201d (Both the new cryptocurrency and its main implementation share the name \u201cBitcoin SV\u201d now.)\nBitcoin Dark\nBitcoin Dark was a codebase fork of Bitcoin Core, making for a cryptocurrency with the same name: Bitcoin Dark. Like Litecoin and many other altcoins, the codebase was tweaked to be entirely incompatible with the Bitcoin protocol right from the start. It is, therefore, an entirely new currency, not a blockchain fork, that just happened to use \u201cBitcoin\u201d in its name. Today, Bitcoin Dark is considered defunct.", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 8}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nNew announcements around Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network have been coming almost nonstop lately, with new exchanges, wallets and other services popping up seemingly every day.\nTwo weeks ago, Zebpay announced its Lightning integration. Last week, Lightning Power Users officially launched and Bitrefill released an improvement to its Thor service. Just this morning, Sparkswap announced the public beta of its Lightning-powered exchange platform.\nNow, there\u2019s a brand-new wallet coming to market with a focus on ease of use. Today, Breez has announced that its mobile Lightning wallet is available in open beta.\nHiding Lightning\u2019s Complexity\nPerhaps the most unique attribute of Breez is that it doesn\u2019t include an on-chain bitcoin wallet. In other words, it\u2019s all Lightning.\n\u201cLightning only,\u201d Breez CEO Roy Sheinfeld confirmed in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThis is one of the elements that simplifies the user experience.\u201d\nSheinfeld pointed to the fact that no bitcoin wallet management is necessary and users have a single balance \u2014 rather than both an on-chain and a Lightning balance \u2014 as examples of this simplification.\nAlthough on-chain funds cannot be stored in Breez, the app includes the ability to move funds from traditional, on-chain bitcoin wallets to the Lightning-based Breez via Submarine Swaps, which were popularized by Lightning Labs Infrastructure Lead Alex Bosworth.\n\u201cBreez allows its users to add or remove funds via on-chain transactions,\u201d said Sheinfeld. \u201cWe use Submarine Swaps to provide a simple user interface without requiring our users to manage another bitcoin wallet inside Breez.\u201d\nSheinfeld also explained how the complexities involved with opening and closing Lightning channels are hidden from users.\n\u201cOpening a channel is seamless to the user,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen a user installs Breez, we automatically open a channel funded by our hub. We provide an lncli-like interface for advanced users for extended channel management.\u201d\nBreez users also don\u2019t need to worry about running a full node (if they trust Breez), as each user automatically runs a Neutrino node, which uses simplified payment verification (SPV), on their mobile devices. (Although it has the same name, this Neutrino node is unrelated to the controversial Blockchain analytics company that was recently acquired by Coinbase.)\nBy default, users can only open channels with a Lightning hub operated by Breez.\n\u201cLightning transactions are executed when both user nodes are online,\u201d explained Sheinfeld. \u201cAnd, since payments are routed via the Breez hub \u2014 which is always online \u2014 there is no chance of misconduct between Breez users. Advanced users can open channels against other nodes, but since third-party watchtower services are not yet available, we do not recommend it.\u201d\nRoom for Improvement\nOf course, this may mean that users must trust Breez not to cheat. It is not a secure best practice to receive Lightning transactions without checking in on the blockchain from time to time, because the user on the other end of a Lightning channel could broadcast a lie about the state of the two parties\u2019 Lightning channel balances.\nBy periodically checking the blockchain for transactions related to the Lightning channel, a user can detect attempts to lie and then broadcast a different transaction to prove that the other person tried to withdraw bitcoin from the channel that wasn\u2019t theirs to take. The user who tried to cheat then loses their share of the Lightning channel\u2019s total balance as punishment.\nSo, the drawback with Breez is that users are unable to securely receive bitcoin on the Lightning Network without checking in with the blockchain every now and then (unless the user is willing to simply trust Breez not to cheat).\n\u201cBreez hub can close the channel when the user is offline and publish an old state to the blockchain,\u201d explained Sheinfeld when asked about the level of trust users must put into Breez. \u201cHowever, since the user runs a light node, the Breez hub can be penalized trying to do so. The risk is when the user is offline for days. Once third-party watchtowers are available, they can help mitigate it and completely reduce this trust.\u201d\nIt should also be noted that, while Neutrino is a massive improvement over old SPV models in terms of privacy, some data is still leaked to the full nodes that serve data to the light clients.\n\u201cNeutrino clients still leak some information about a user\u2019s wallet, since an adversary can potentially observe which blocks the client is downloading and find addresses that are reused across those downloaded blocks,\u201d according to a Lightning Labs blog post on Neutrino. \u201cTo mitigate this, we\u2019re exploring the use of Private Information Retrieval for blocks as mentioned above. Nonetheless, we believe Neutrino is still far better for user privacy than other mobile options.\u201d\nHowever, these issues around privacy and trust are not specific to Breez and really stem from the Lightning Network being in the early stages of development.\nActing as a Lightning Hub for Users\nThe Breez hub is a key aspect of this Lightning wallet\u2019s attempt at creating a user interface that is simple to use and easy to understand, and they\u2019ll need to stake enough bitcoin in their hub to allow their users to transact on the network.\n\u201cUsers\u2019 channels are private,\u201d said Sheinfeld. \u201cCurrently, for each user we open a channel with one million satoshis capacity. We have hundreds of users in the closed beta and anticipate a few thousand soon after opening the beta. We try to minimize opening public channels to others\u2019 hubs, and only maintain channels with well-connected hubs. We currently have 1.5 bitcoin in our public channels which we rebalance frequently.\u201d\nIn these early days, it will be extremely important for Breez to properly manage its hub\u2019s position in the greater Lightning Network. If the Breez hub is not well connected, its users\u2019 payments will fail and they won\u2019t have the option to open a channel with another Lightning node or fall back to the blockchain to make the transaction.\nOf course, users can always use a Submarine Swap to move their funds to another bitcoin wallet if they\u2019re unable to make a payment with Breez.\nAccording to Sheinfeld, this sort of model, where bitcoin wallets provide their users with a Lightning hub, is one way in which the Lightning Network itself is likely to increase its user base, at least in the first phase.\n\u201cI think the next step would be to decouple the wallets from the hubs,\u201d he added. \u201cWe at Breez are already working to provide the ability for our users to choose other hubs, similar to the internet ISP model. A mobile wallet still needs to provide services that are not related to operating a hub, such as mobile notifications, on-chain updates, Submarine Swaps and others.\u201d\nIn the past, there have been concerns that Lightning hubs (or even smaller Lightning nodes) could be targeted with regulations due to the view that they\u2019re acting as money transmitters. When asked about this matter, Sheinfeld agreed there is reason to be worried about this.\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned regulators won\u2019t understand our technology,\u201d said Sheinfeld. \u201cAs a non-custodial service, we are not managing funds on behalf of our users. Our hub acts as a routing node. In that regard, it\u2019s no different than an ISP or an internet provider.\u201d\nAdditional Features\nBreez also has additional features outside of its Lightning functionality.\nThe wallet supports FastBitcoins.com for users who wish to add bitcoin to the app via a cash-based exchange, while a credit card-based model through a partnership with a currently unnamed third party is also in the works.\n\u201cWe really want to encourage users to spend bitcoin instead of converting them back to fiat, that\u2019s why we are currently investing our efforts in expanding our marketplace,\u201d said Sheinfeld.\nThe marketplace Sheinfeld mentioned currently only includes Bitrefill, but Breez plans to add ln.pizza integration in the near future.\n\u201cWe\u2019re always looking for serious Lightning merchants to work with us to provide a great Lightning-fast shopping experience,\u201d added Sheinfeld. \u201cThere aren\u2019t that many at the moment.\u201d\nBreez also plans to partner with another third party to handle fiat off-ramps for merchants.\n\u201cWe started exploring with several vendors the ability to provide bitcoin to fiat conversion: this is a must-have for merchants,\u201d said Sheinfeld.\nThere is also a Breez card that allows users to make purchases at traditional payment terminals via near field communication (NFC).\n\u201cBreez supports NFC, both using a device or via a Breez card,\u201d explained Sheinfeld. \u201cThere are cases, like in a restaurant, when you don\u2019t want or can\u2019t hand out your phone to make a payment. In this scenario, it is much easier to use a card. You can give the card to someone else (like your child) to buy something, and since you need to approve the purchase in your device, you have full control on how the card is being used. The point behind the card is to demonstrate the bitcoin payments can be on-par with fiat when it comes to user experience.\u201d\nAlthough Breez isn\u2019t completely trustless or private, the app provides a glimpse into how much more user-friendly Lightning wallets could be once additional tools, such as watchtowers and an even more privacy-enhanced version of Neutrino, are available.", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 8}

According to Bitmain, these are the three most advanced BTC and BCH miners under the SHA-256 algorithm.\nThe Antminer S17 comes in two variants, a 56 tera hashes per second (TH/s) and a 53 TH/s model, with two mining modes. Both models operate at 45 joules per tera hash (J/TH) under the normal mode, while the low-power mode operates at 42 J/TH.\nThe Antminer S17 Pro also comes in two variants, a 53 TH/s and a 50 TH/s model, with three mining modes which \u201callows for greater customization as customers can switch between different settings to accommodate various mining requirements,\u201d according to Bitmain\u2019s blog. Both models have a power efficiency of 45 J/TH under turbo mode, while the normal modes operate at 39.5 J/TH and the low-power operates at 36 J/TH.\nLast September, Bitmain launched its first 7 nanometer (nm) mining chips with a power efficiency of 42 J/TH. Soon after, the firm launched its S15/T15 miners equipped with the 7 nm chips in November 2018. They are the predecessors of BM1397 chips and the Antminer 17 series miners.\nThe firm claimed that the second-generation of the 7 nm BM1397 mining chips used in the 17 series miners will save 28.6 percent of energy consumption compared to the previous one. The S17 and S17 Pro may save 26 to 36 percent of energy consumption compared to the previous S15 series.\nBitmain indicated that the BM1397 chips have improved in circuit structure with low power dissipation that makes S17 miners much more effective. In addition, the S17 Pro adopts a brand-new cooling solution. It inherits the S15 double-fan design, but the wind-path is shortened by half, the temperature difference between the inlet and outlet of the miner becomes smaller and the performance has been improved.\nThe Antminer 17 series will be released in two batches and will be available for purchase at 14:00 (GMT+8) on April 9 on Bitmain\u2019s official website.\nYang Xin, the person in charge of product at Bitmain, concluded that the low energy consumption ratio and advanced performance are the two main advantages of the Antminer 17 series miners in an interview with Odaily.\n\u201cYang added that \u2018purchasing latest mining devices is more profitable, it enables people to make money faster,\u2019\u201d per the report.", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 8}

The rise also marked its best one-day gain since April 2018. Bitcoin is trading at $5,252 as of press time, up 1.77 percent over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\nHowever, on April 2, Zhao emphasized on Weibo that despite the abrupt surge of BTC, the bull market is not here yet and he hinted that the next bitcoin bull run will not start until crypto speculators\u2019 patience is worn out in the bear market and the crypto hype is gone.\n\n\nIn another Weibo post which was released on April 5, Zhao noted that $4,000 was basically this cycle\u2019s final bottom for BTC and it could run to $6,000. He predicted that BTC will fluctuate between $4,000 and $6,000 for half a year and, in October, it\u2019s likely to establish a higher low near $5,000.\n\n\nThe bitcoin tycoon also predicted that the upcoming bitcoin block reward halving, which is expected to occur sometime around May 2020, will push the price further upward.\n\u201cBitcoin price could rise moderately to $10,000 before the halving event next year. After that, it will plunge to somewhere between $6,000 and $7,000,\u201d said Zhao, who added that hopefully a new bull market will arrive by then, which will propel BTC to hit a new peak, somewhere between $50,000 and $100,000 or even higher in 2021.\nHe also added in a recent WeChat Moments post that it does not matter whether his prediction is correct, what really matters is the fact that, if bitcoin wants to surge to and remain above $50,000, hundreds of billions of dollars must be poured into the market.\n\u201cWhat matters most is where the unprecedented amount of capital comes from and how it enters the market. Until then, a new market structure will be defined and we will see shrinking golden opportunities for start-ups and investments in the sector,\u201d Zhao said.\nTherefore, he believes that \u201cwhat to do now\u201d and \u201cwhat to invest in now\u201d is vital.", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 8}

By offering services like International Bank Account Number (IBAN) accounts, credit card processing and international SWIFT transfers for fiat to companies that want to use cryptocurrency, the company hopes to bridge the gap between traditional banking and bitcoin.\n\u201cWe are the first banking platform to not only embrace crypto completely but also give a full current account to crypto companies and SMEs [small- and medium-sized enterprises],\u201d Kumar Gaurav, founder and CEO of Cashaa, said in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine.\nJanina Lowisz, the vice president of marketing, added, \u201cWe are solving the problem which crypto-related businesses everywhere have of not being able to open an account with a traditional bank, or having their accounts cancelled. Our goal is to create a hassle-free experience for the whole crypto space, including STO-backed companies, exchanges, wallets and brokers.\u201d\nToward that end, in November 2018, Cashaa launched the Cashaa Multisig Compliance (CMC) wallet, designed for use both by individual consumers and by businesses seeking an alternative to traditional bank accounts, which are sometimes difficult for businesses in the crypto space to open.\nAs the wallet\u2019s name implies, it is built around two key feature sets. First, if offers compliance features designed to assess the risk of each wallet transaction. Transactions identified as high risk are reviewed by the Cashaa team, the company said.\nThe second feature is a multisignature architecture that requires three keys for a wallet transaction. This is another security feature designed to reduce fraud.\nIn both of these ways, Cashaa\u2019s wallet caters to demand for more security around cryptocurrency. But, arguably, what really sets Cashaa apart is that its wallet also features an integrated exchange service that lets users trade fiat currency for crypto and vice versa. The service supports more than a dozen fiat currencies and is utilized by 200 companies, according to Cashaa.\nCompared to other payment services such as Neteller and PlasmaPay, which are designed to work easily with both crypto and fiat currencies, Cashaa\u2019s chief distinguishing feature is its ability to work without requiring a separate bank account, Lowisz said.\n\u201cCashaa is a full banking product which can be used as a multisig wallet, payment gateway and exchange, with a full U.K.-based current account with MasterCard,\u201d according to Lowisz. \u201cWith us, you can have all your fiat and crypto needs fulfilled in one place, and don\u2019t need a bank account to withdraw funds.\u201d\nShe added that Cashaa does not see companies like Neteller and PlasmaPay as competitors, but instead \u201cas possible partners: They can open an \u2018advance merchant account\u2019 with us, which not only gives them fiat capability to handle crypto conversions but also lets them give IBAN accounts to their customers.\u201d\nCashaa currently has 179 businesses and more than 2,000 individuals among its user base, according to Lowisz.\nOn April 8, 2019, Cashaa expanded its business offerings to include three tiers: \u201cStart\u201d (which is free), \u201cStandard\u201d and \u201cAdvanced,\u201d each providing different levels of banking services. The paid tiers include features such as the ability to issue IBANs to customers and to store up to \u00a31 billion British pounds, Lowisz said, as well as a Mastercard linked to the account.\n\u201cThe crypto space now has a true alternative that makes all bank account struggles a thing of the past,\u201d Gaurav said.\nThe company expects to add support for more cryptocurrencies to its wallet and exchange services later this year and, eventually, offer Mastercard-linked accounts for individuals in addition to businesses, Lowisz said.\nCashaa has formed a close partnership with Auxesis, which was also founded by Gaurav. In 2017, Auxesis, whose Auxledger blockchain framework supports multiple government agencies in India, and Cashaa announced a partnership designed to help the latter expand its operations in India.\nGaurav has also founded or worked with several other startups inside and outside of the crypto industry, such as the Italian peer-to-peer insurance platform DarWinsurance, which was acquired in 2018 by another Italian company, and Responsible Gold, which uses a blockchain and tokens to register digital ownership of \u201cconflict-free gold.\u201d", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 9}

The list includes more than 400 other industrial activities.\nThe list is part of the NDRC\u2019s Catalogue for Guiding Industry Restructuring. The catalogue was issued in 2005, pointing out the activities and industries which are allowed to grow in the country or those that ought to be restricted or banned outright.\nReuters reported that the draft list has been open for public perusal since April 8, 2019, although the NDRC has not yet set a date for the elimination of cryptomining activities from the state. The draft list shows a distinct representation of the Chinese state\u2019s views on certain industrial policies and activities, and an announcement on the NDRC\u2019s official site claims that members of the general public now have until May 7 to provide their comments on the draft.\nChina was once seen as a crypto haven, thanks to the country\u2019s abundance of mining hardware and cheap energy. But developments like this make it seem as if the country has grown cold toward industry.\nDespite a blanket ban on ICOs in 2017, China has maintained dominance in the cryptomining sector, with some of the world's biggest mining companies operating from China \u2014 most notably, Bitmain. The recent notice by the NDRC has been a long time coming.\nLate last year, the Xinhua News Agency reported that a study showed the impact of carbon dioxide emissions on global warming and their potential to increase temperatures by 2\u00baC as soon as 2033.\nA separate report also claimed that authorities had seized hundreds of mining computers, after discovering they were responsible for the abnormal electricity consumption and a potential threat to the proper functioning of local power grids.\nIn addition, the Leading Group of Internet Financial Risks Remediation called on local governments to direct mining companies to make an \"orderly exit\" from the market.\nThe Chinese government has been making massive moves to stem the growth of crypto-based firms in the country for a while. The People\u2019s Bank of China made the historic decision to place a ban on all ICOs back in 2017 and, since then, crypto companies have had to walk on regulatory eggshells.\nIn January 2018, a report on Bloomberg revealed that the Chinese Central Bank seemed to plan a reduction of the power supplied to bitcoin miners, in a move aimed at forcing them out of the country.\nThe Beijing-based Bitmain remains one of the largest manufacturers of cryptomining hardware in the world. However, the company has had to endure a torrid two years after its profits and viability were hit hard by the effects of crypto winter.\nIf this reported ban is enacted, it would mean that Bitmain could lose its business in China, one of its largest markets. This may prompt the company to relocate its business, something that could be difficult given its recent office closures in North America and Europe.", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 9}

Leveraging the Lightning Network, the exchange is non-custodial and trading is decentralized. Users will be able to execute buy and sell orders between each other directly and, thanks to atomic swapping, they\u2019ll also be able to trade coins across blockchains.\n\u201cAt no point can either Sparkswap or your counterparty deprive you of your assets \u2014 the trades either complete or they do not,\u201d Sparkswap Founder Trey Griffith told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe are also a venue for trading, not an over-the-counter service like ShapeShift, so users are trading with each other.\u201d\nFor this mainnet launch, Sparkswap will only feature a bitcoin and litecoin trading pair, but it could feasibly support other atomic swap-friendly cryptocurrencies like decred, vertcoin or komodo. Griffith added that the exchange also has \u201cplans to accommodate many other cryptocurrencies, including beyond Bitcoin Script-based projects.\u201d The technology, Griffith said, can accommodate other payment channel networks that aren\u2019t necessarily compatible with the Lightning Network, so long as certain criteria are met.\n\n\n\nTo access the exchange, users need to download Sparkswap Broker, the exchange\u2019s open-source software. This kit includes everything needed to bootstrap both a Bitcoin and Litecoin full node, as well as Bitcoin and Litecoin Lightning nodes for running payment channels. If you\u2019re already running full nodes, then you\u2019re free to use these, though Griffith said that, for now, the exchange\u2019s inaugural users cannot leverage their own Lightning nodes or custodial Lightning services.\nWhen we asked if the exchange will evolve to support other Lightning Network technology like Submarine Swaps in the future, Griffith said that the semi-on-chain nature of this technical trick doesn\u2019t fit Sparkswap\u2019s use case.\n\u201cOur focus is on making cryptocurrency trading fast enough for professional users without sacrificing Bitcoin support and self-custody,\u201d Griffith said. \u201cSubmarine Swaps by their nature are on-chain for half of the transaction, so while they provide an important service for the network (as evidenced by Lightning Loop), they don't fit the needs of the product that we're building [or] our users.\u201d\nDebuting at the outset of 2018, the Lightning Network continues to enjoy increasing developer activity and impressive growth. With technical solutions, wallets and services proliferating, as well as community initiatives like the Lightning Torch, Griffith believes that optimism has supplanted the doubt that used to surround the Lightning Network in the infancy of its construction. For him, Sparkswap harnesses both this positive outlook and the payment network\u2019s great promise, and there\u2019s not a better time to be working toward the future of Bitcoin.\n\u201cI've been building on Lightning since late 2017 when it was still \u2018never going to ship,\u2019 so from my perspective these projects and efforts have been under the surface for a long time, but are now finally breaking through,\u201d Griffith said. \u201cLightning is certainly not a finished product, but it has a ton of interesting applications, including near-instant cross-chain swaps like Sparkswap, that I'm excited to see get built out and gain usage. Collectively, we're building the infrastructure that is going to power a Bitcoin-based financial system, and that makes this a very exciting time to be in this industry.\u201d", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 8}

The company\u2019s platform works by monitoring financial transactions and assessing the electronic identities of users to identify behaviors or attributes that could signal a financial compliance or fraud issue. It also helps clients evaluate the financial reputations and reliability of organizations they seek to work with.\nIt is one of several firms within the portfolio of Medici Ventures, a subsidiary of Overstock.com that invests in blockchain-focused companies.\nSo, naturally, IdentityMind is not new to the crypto industry. In 2015, the company introduced a service to help businesses remain in compliance with New York State\u2019s BitLicense framework. Only a handful of companies ever received approval from New York State to operate under the terms of BitLicense, but the framework, which remains in place today, was nonetheless important as an early effort by government authorities to regulate Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nThe Binance partnership extends IdentityMind\u2019s operations into a sector of the crypto industry where it stands to make a larger impact: cryptocurrency exchanges. Binance, which supports more than 100 cryptocurrencies, is currently the largest exchange in the world in terms of volume traded.\nBy partnering with IdentityMind to provide better security and compliance solutions, Binance appears eager to set itself apart from other exchanges and provide assurance to users worried about fraud or theft.\n\u201cThe partnership between Binance and IdentityMind further strengthens our compliance capabilities and our commitment to re-invest in the blockchain ecosystem and grow it,\u201d Samuel Lim, chief compliance officer of Binance, said in the release.\nSo far, the companies have revealed few details about how, exactly, IdentityMind\u2019s services are being integrated with Binance. It\u2019s also unclear whether the primary goal of the partnership is to help Binance meet its own security and compliance obligations, or to help Binance customers with that goal.\nNonetheless, given the frequency of reports about fraud in the crypto industry, as well as the lingering association of crypto with illicit activities like money laundering in many peoples\u2019 minds, any move to bolster security and compliance by Binance will likely give it a leg up in the highly competitive world of crypto exchanges.", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 27}

This latter feature prevents someone from simply using a static image or prerecorded video to fake an identity.\nUsers who reach an equivalent of $1,500 in trade volume or wallet activity on Paxful will be required to verify their accounts through ID verification. Users who reach $10,000 in trade volume or wallet activity will also be asked to verify their addresses.\nIt was also important to Paxful that this advanced ID verification did not require the use of a smartphone.\n\u201cThey can just as easily use a web camera as well,\u201d Youssef said. \u201cGiven that we have a large customer base in emerging markets, this was a key benefactor in going with Jumio. They make it easy for our customers, no matter where they are, to provide ID and address verification.\u201d\nThe introduction of AI-powered ID verification comes at a time when Paxful has seen a steady rise in the number of users trading bitcoin on the platform. In 2018, for instance, Paxful saw an increase in volume of around 125 percent, Youssef said, crediting the surge with an emergence of cryptocurrency trades in Africa.\n\u201cAfrica is our top market and has reached an average of 17,000 trades per day,\u201d he explained. \u201cMany Africans are used to KYC. For example, in Nigeria you must KYC with a fingerprint scan to get a SIM card for your phone.

The presence of conflicting snapshots for a particular \u201caltchain\u201d triggers early attack detection (EAD) metrics, which warns users about the potential rewrite before they confirm the transaction and updates them when the transaction is safe to accept.\nVeriBlock uses OP_RETURN \u2014 a type of bitcoin transaction that is used for embedding data on the blockchain. It can be used for anything from proving the existence of some data at a specific point in time (proof of existence) to issuing new assets, all on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\u201cA \u2018regular\u2019 Bitcoin transaction and one carrying a VeriBlock publication need not be mutually exclusive,\u201d VeriBlock CTO Max Sanchez said. \u201cIt would be a relatively simple engineering matter to add an option in a Bitcoin wallet that said \u2018Sending BTC? Secure the crypto-ecosystem with VeriBlock and subsidize your BTC transaction fee.\u2019\u201d\nDoes VeriBlock Create Problems for Bitcoin?\nThere have been estimates of the percentage of the Bitcoin blockspace used by VeriBlock that range from 20 percent of the network to as high as 45 percent. This may raise some concerns about how VeriBlock will affect the network.\n\u201cThis was widely reported right before the VeriBlock testnet was phased out,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cHowever, the effects of proof of proof on the Bitcoin network are actually very small \u2026 As demand for bitcoin transactions increases and users are willing to bid higher fees, the amount of space VeriBlock consumes in Bitcoin will shrink \u2014 the two economic forces result in an equilibrium.\u201d\nSanchez also noted that VeriBlock\u2019s solution offers security regardless of Bitcoin\u2019s transaction frequency at a given time.\n\u201cThe natural ebb-and-flow of VeriBlock transaction volume on Bitcoin does not affect the security characteristics of VeriBlock or VeriBlock-secured altchains, nor does it adversely affect Bitcoin,\u201d he said.\nJameson Lopp, CTO of Casa, has been observing VeriBlock\u2019s activity on Bitcoin\u2019s testnet for over a year.\nDuring an episode of the HSHR8 podcast on March 20, 2019, Lopp said that he doesn\u2019t see the VeriBlock venture as an attack on the Bitcoin network, as some might, but he wondered about the economics of spending millions in fees to provide security.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re paying the fees to put it in the blockchain and you convince some miners to put it in, then there might be some economic rationality for this,\u201d he said. Lopp also noted that he can see \u201cthe value of having a data anchor\u201d for Bitcoin.\n\u201cWe believe that VeriBlock elegantly expands Bitcoin\u2019s usefulness and does so in a way that doesn\u2019t result in a burden on the network,\u201d VeriBlock CEO Justin Fisher told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cIt drives demand for Bitcoin and also, in its own way, helps make Bitcoin more secure while maximizing the utility derived from Bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption.\u201d\nIn an announcement on March 25, 2019, Matt Roszak, Bloq co-founder; Anthony Di Iorio, founder and CEO of Decentral; and Bill Shihara, co-founder and CEO of Bittrex, all commended VeriBlock on its innovative new protocol, expecting it to add a new level of security to the blockchain ecosystem.\n\"Bloq is proud to have been part of the journey with VeriBlock over the past two years \u2014 and especially with a technology that helps any blockchain project thrive and benefit from the security that Bitcoin provides,\u201d Roszak wrote on his company blog. \u201cAs the multi-chain, multi-network, multi-token world emerges, we are confident that VeriBlock will continue to play a vital role as a security root for this new frontier.\"\nThe vice president of crypto exchange BitBuy, Jordan Anderson, also praised the solution in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine.\n\u201cVeriBlock is an excellent example of a proof-of-proof initiative to ensure altcoins are not susceptible to a 51-percent attack,\u201d he said. \u201cVeriBlock will promote security and stability within the altcoin ecosystem, and provide greater confidence to consumers looking to participate.\u201d\nMeanwhile, long-time bitcoin core developer Peter Todd was more apprehensive, explaining that he needed time to look at the actual implementation of the VeriBlock project.\n\u201cThe general idea of piggybacking on an existing consensus system is a good one,\u201d he said. \u201cBut VeriBlock is an unusually complex variant of that idea, so I'm not confident given what I've seen in the white paper that it is secure.\u201d", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 26}

Bitmain filed the application for its IPO on September 26, 2018, and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange had six months to decide whether to reject the filing, graduate it to a hearing stage or let it lapse.\nAfter half a year in limbo, the exchange\u2019s inaction means the filing has officially expired.\n\u201cBitmain\u2019s listing application to [the Hong Kong Stock Exchange] HKex in September 2018 has reached its [six]-month expiration date,\u201d according to a press release that Bitmain shared with Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe do recognize that despite the huge potential of the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, it remains a relatively young industry which is proving its value. We hope regulatory authorities, media, and the general public can be more inclusive to this young industry. We will restart the listing application work at an appropriate time in the future.\u201d\nRecent speculation surrounding the lofty IPO, which Bitmain reportedly hoped would raise a record $18 billion, assumed that the application would peter out as the deadline drew nearer without any indication that it would reach the next step in the filing process.\nThe release continued to note that \u201cthe listing process has made the company more transparent and standardized.\u201d\nAt the very least, it\u2019s brought the tenuous health of the mining firm\u2019s finances into the public light. And the state of these finances could be the very reason why the application never progressed past the filing phase.\nDespite earning roughly $700 million in 2017, Bitmain lost $400 million in Q2 of 2018, according to an IPO prospectus. To make matters worse, the company reportedly lost some $500 million in Q3 of 2018 according to analysis of a leaked and unconfirmed pre-IPO presentation (Bitmain denies this projected loss as a false rumor). This isn\u2019t surprising given the industry\u2019s multi-year bear market, which has stressed the profitability of mining and the sale of mining equipment. For instance, Bitmain\u2019s Antmine S9 used to sell for $5,000. Now, it sells for just over $200.\nThe company\u2019s decision to stack reserves of bitcoin cash could also be partly to blame for waning finances. According to an unconfirmed pre-IPO investor deck, Bitmain held over 1 million BCH in March 2018 and it actively liquidated bitcoin in favor of the forked alternative. This information became public in August 2018 when BCH was valued at roughly $550 a coin, but following the Bitcoin SV chain split, the coin is now worth about $160. So, holdings that used to be worth $550 million are now worth $160 million.\nStill, the press release Bitmain sent to Bitcoin Magazine maintains an optimistic outlook. Alongside the IPO process reinforcing a sense of the company\u2019s transparency, this period of growth has given it time to focus on improving its hardware and chips for both crypto mining and AI, Bitmain claimed. It also led to a restructuring of its executive positions, including co-founder Jihan Wu splitting a Bitmain board director position with fellow co-founder Micree Zhan.\nWhile Bitmain remains the world's dominant mining outfit, some competitors are closing the gap. Canaan Creative, another Chinese mining hardware firm, for example, recently reached a valuation of $1 billion. Still a far cry off from Bitmain\u2019s alleged valuation of $14 billion (a figure that dates back more than half a year and is likely less following its 2018 losses), the company's sales have grown by a factor of three from 2015 to 2017. Even so, Canaan Creative\u2019s own IPO prospectus also expired after the six-month deliberation phase with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, indicating that Bitmain has by no means lost its pole position.", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 25}

Europol began gathering international teams of experts to the organization\u2019s headquarters in the Netherlands in July of 2018 and began work in late 2018 and early 2019 to prosecute dark web traffickers of illegal narcotics, counterfeit currency and other such contraband in several nations.\nThe history of the dark web is deeply entangled with Bitcoin\u2019s initial rise to prominence as a household name. In 2012 and 2013, up to 7 percent of all transacted bitcoin value was connected to darknet markets, particularly the Silk Road. While this percentage has dropped considerably, darknet market activity nearly doubled last year, according to Chainalysis.\nSince the Silk Road was famously shut down in 2013, several successor sites have attempted to fill this gap. Hansa Market, for example, was shut down in 2017 following a joint law enforcement operation of agencies including Europol. Dream Market, possibly the most popular dark web site today, has announced it will shut down in April 2019 after being targeted by law enforcement. This decision may be connected to Europol\u2019s announced crackdown.\nIt is not clear how long Europol will continue this operation, which had been ongoing for several months before the public announcement. The announcement included several strongly worded warnings about using the dark web for illegal purchases, noting that the risks for doing so are \u201cactually higher than those on the surface web.\u201d In conjunction with the enforcement action, Europol has signaled a concerted and long-lasting campaign to deter dark web users and purveyors.", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 28}

This marks a major change for the service, which had been a primary way for users wishing to protect their anonymity to meet others willing to buy or sell bitcoin in person without sharing details about their identities.\nThe Act on Virtual Currency Service Providers was passed alongside an amendment to the country\u2019s existing Act on Detecting and Preventing Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing, also known as its anti-money laundering (AML) law. Together, these regulations will bring cryptocurrency services like LocalBitcoins under the AML law and the supervision of the country\u2019s Financial Supervisory Authority.\nLocalBitcoins Introduces Changes\nThe changes will come into effect in November, and per the post, LocalBitcoins has framed the new regulations as an advantage for the long-term viability and acceptance of Bitcoin.\n\u201cThe Virtual Currency Service Providers Act will come into full effect in the beginning of November 2019 creating a legal status for crypto assets, which should improve significantly Bitcoin\u2019s standing as a viable and legit financial network,\u201d according to the statement. \u201cWe have launched a new account registration process where users can verify basic information already during sign-up, making it easier for the newcomer to find trading partners \u2026 and increasing the number of suitable customers to advertisers as well as inhibiting the creation of illegitimate accounts.\u201d\nThe company also said that it was improving its verification systems at users\u2019 requests. This will include four individual account levels per trade and BTC volume, as well as a separate verification process for corporate accounts.\n\u201cIn certain situations we may require enhanced identity verification,\u201d the company\u2019s updated terms of service states. \u201cThis may include requirements to verify details or sources of funds regarding payments you have made or received during trades on LocalBitcoins as well as bitcoin transactions that you\u2019ve sent or received from your LocalBitcoins account.\u201d\nPrior to the inclusion of know-your-customer (KYC) measures on LocalBitcoins, new users could register an account and start trading in less than 10 seconds.

This slow, drift upward marks our fourth test of the resistance zone and, unlike the three prior tests, our rejection of the level has shown a weakness on the side of the bears:\n\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Fourth Rejection\nIf we compare the three prior rejections (labeled 1, 2 and 3), we see that the move into this resistance level was violent \u2014 and had equally violent rejections. Our fourth attempt, however, was brought into the level on low volatility and saw a weak rejection.\nIn addition, we are displaying our first sign of support above a crucial level in our market structure (outlined below in black):\n\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Current Rejection Finally Finding Support\nThis black, outlined level is significant level as it represents the first macro support/resistance flip at this level. This represents our first time withstanding a rejection of the red zone while maintaining the support of the black level. If we look a bit closer, we can see the formation of what appears to be a reaccumulation trading range that is currently finding support in the upper boundary of the range:\n\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, Hourly Candles, Low Time Frame Trading Range\nOne identifying characteristic of this trading range is the shakeout to the bottom side of the range, followed by a strong, impulsive move to the upside. This impulsive move to the upside represents, once again, a support/resistance flip (outlined in blue). This level previously supplied resistance as the market found itself unable to maintain support every time the market made its way to the top half of the range.\nThis shakeout into a support/resistance flip is often symptomatic of reaccumulation in the market. Failure to maintain this support would obviously change the market structure, but so long as the hourly time frame maintains its support on this level, the market structure remains bullish. And, considering it\u2019s consolidating right below the red resistance outlined in Figure 1, it puts the bears in an uneasy position.\nThe fact that we haven\u2019t been completely rejected at this level yet, after our fourth attempt to crack the resistance, is a good sign that supply is exhausting and bears are running out of ammo for the time being. Also, it should be noted that this red level we are testing is a level that could soon put shorters underwater on their positions. If we see a strong test to the upside and manage to push a new high, it is very likely we will see a strong continuation in the upward direction.\nFor months, the market has stacked short position after short position in a very tight band of prices. If we shove above that band of prices we can expect to see a strong surge of stop losses hit the market in what\u2019s known as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d A short squeeze is essentially just a cascade of stop losses that close out short positions via a market buy order. As the price pushes further up, the stop losses continue to stop out the next person in line, then the next person in line, and so on, until the bears are finally cleared out of their positions.\nThis short squeeze idea is all speculation at this point as we have yet to manage to find support on the red band of resistance described in this article \u2014 it\u2019s just something to consider as the shorters begin to pile up, yet again, for the fourth time.\nSummary:\nCreeping upward, the market finally finds itself testing long-held overhead resistance. So far, we have seen three unsuccessful tests that were swiftly rejected. And now, for the fourth time, the market finds itself testing the level without a strong rejection.The market has managed to find support on macro levels that were previously resistant for the first time as we creep up once again for a test of the macro resistance.On lower time frames, we can see signs of reaccumulation as bitcoin grinds against the macro resistance and tests the strength of the supply in the market.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

{"title": "Op Ed: Answering 10 Common Questions About Cryptocurrency and Taxes", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-answering-10-common-questions-about-cryptocurrency-and-taxes/", "birthday": "Mar 29, 2019 11:15 AM EST", "date": "2019-03-29 16:15:00", "content": "Depending on what country you live in, your cryptocurrency will be subject to different tax rules. The questions below address implications within the United States, specifically, but similar issues arise around the world. As always, check with a local tax professional to assess your own particular tax situation.\nAre My Cryptocurrency Trades Taxable?\nYes. Cryptocurrency is treated as property by the IRS in the United States. This means that it is subject to capital gains and losses rules similar to other forms of property like stocks, bonds, real estate and gold.\nYou need to file taxes for your trades when you trade one coin for another or whenever you sell your crypto. Simply buying and holding cryptocurrency is not taxable; you only realize your gain or loss when you sell it.\nHow Do I Calculate My Gains and Losses From My Crypto Trades?\nTo calculate your capital gains and losses on your crypto trades, apply this formula:\nFair Market Value \u2013 Cost Basis = Capital Gain / Loss\nFair market value is simply how much an asset would sell for on the open market. Again, with cryptocurrency, this fair market value is how much the coin was worth in terms of U.S. dollars at the time of the sale.\nCost basis is the original value of an asset for tax purposes. In the world of crypto, your cost basis is essentially how much it cost you to acquire the coin.\nFor example:\nLet\u2019s say you bought 5 ETH on Coinbase in January of 2018. You paid $2,000 for these ETH ($400 for each coin). After the market took a turn for the worse, you sold 3 of these ETH in July for $150 each.\nIn this example, your cost basis for the 3 ETH that you sold is $1,200 (3 * $400). You sold the coins for $450 total. This is your fair market value.\nDoing the math: $450 \u2013 $1,200 = -$750.\nYou incurred a $750 capital loss. You would file this loss on your taxes and it would reduce your tax bill. You would not owe taxes on the 2 ETH that you are still holding because you haven't traded or sold them yet.\nKeep in mind, coin-to-coin trades are considered both a \u201cbuy\u201d and a \u201csell\u201d for tax purposes.\nA Coin-to-Coin Trade Example:\nSo, let\u2019s say instead of selling your 3 ETH for U.S. dollars, you traded your 3 ETH for X amount of bitcoin. In this case, you have still triggered a taxable event, but now your fair market value is a little bit harder to calculate. You need to know what the value of the 3 ETH was in USD at the time of trading to calculate your loss on the transaction.\nUsing bitcoin tax software to crunch all of these historical numbers can be a huge time saver.\nWhat Do I Do With My 1099-K from Coinbase, Gemini or Another Exchange?\nA 1099-K is a form that reports credit card transactions and third-party network payments that you have received during the year. It is not an \"entry\" document, meaning you don't need to attach or \"include\" it with your tax return.\n1099-Ks from exchanges like Coinbase report the total dollar amount of transactions that occurred from your account. This number can, therefore, be very large and not at all representative of how much money you put into Coinbase or how much money you owe or do not owe in Coinbase taxes. The IRS is aware of this. Tax documents from exchanges like Coinbase will also be completely inaccurate if you ever moved crypto into other wallets, exchanges or other platforms differing from the one that sent you the 1099-K.\nIn order to properly report your crypto taxes, you need to capture your holistic crypto activity across all exchanges and platforms and complete a 8949 form.\nCan I Save Money on My Taxes if I Lost Money Trading?\nYes. If you realized losses throughout the year from trading crypto, these losses can and should be used to offset other capital gains as well as up to $3,000 in ordinary income. Keep in mind, you need to \u201crealize\u201d these gains to be able to write them off on your taxes.\nWhat does this look like in real life?\nLet's say you gained $20,000 in the stock market this year (this is a capital gain) and you lost $20,000 trading cryptocurrency. Your loss in crypto would completely offset your $20,000 stock market gain. Therefore, you would pay no taxes on your stock market activity. If you are at a 25 percent tax bracket, this form of tax loss harvesting would save you $5,000 in taxes ($20,000 * 0.25).\nNote, there are many other forms of capital gains that your crypto can offset.\nWhat if I have no other forms of capital gains?\nIn the scenario, where you have no other capital gains, your losses simply offset your income up to $3,000.\nAs an example, let\u2019s say you started 2018 doing really well as a crypto trader. You made $5,000 trading BTC and ETH. Once August rolled around and the markets took a turn for the worse, you got hit hard and the value of your portfolio dropped significantly. You ended up selling out of all of your positions and took a $7,000 loss. From here, you would be able to harvest a $2,000 loss for the year. This loss would be deducted from your taxable income for the year. If you made $50,000 on the year in income, only $48,000 of that income would be taxable.\nCrypto Is so Complex. Will the Government Really be Able to Prove I Am Not Accurately Reporting My Taxes?\nIt is actually not on the IRS to \u201cprove\u201d that you accurately reported. If audited, the IRS will require you to prove to them that you handled your money and cryptocurrency in the way you claimed on your tax return. The concept of \u201cinnocent until proven guilty\u201d does not apply to the world of IRS audits.\nThe IRS has also made it clear that it is taking cryptocurrency very seriously after it announced on July 2, 2018, that one of its core campaigns and focuses for the year is the taxation of virtual currencies.\nWhen Do I Owe Taxes on My Cryptocurrency?\nThe following examples have been taken from the official IRS guidance from 2014 as to what is considered a \u201ctaxable event\u201d for cryptocurrency. A taxable event is simply a fancy term describing the circumstances in which you incur a tax liability that you must report.\nTrading cryptocurrency to fiat currency like the U.S. dollar is a taxable event.Trading cryptocurrency to cryptocurrency is a taxable event (you have to calculate the fair market value in USD at the time of the trade).Using cryptocurrency for goods and services is a taxable event (again, you have to calculate the fair market value in USD at the time of the trade; you may also end up owing sales tax).Giving cryptocurrency as a gift is not a taxable event (the recipient inherits the cost basis; the gift tax still applies if you exceed the gift tax exemption amount).A wallet-to-wallet transfer is not a taxable event (you can transfer between exchanges or wallets without realizing capital gains and losses, so make sure to check your records against the records of your exchanges as they may count transfers as taxable events as a safe harbor).Buying cryptocurrency with USD is not a taxable event. You don\u2019t realize gains until you trade, use or sell your crypto. If you hold for longer than a year, you can realize long-term capital gains (which are about half the rate of short-term gains.) If you hold for less than a year, you realize short-term capital gains and losses.\nCryptocurrencies Change in Value All of the Time. How Do I Know What Value to Report to the IRS?\nVirtual currency wages, self-employment income or cryptocurrency trades should be reported using the full fair market value of the cryptocurrency at the time the payment was made. If you don\u2019t have a record of what the fair market value of your crypto was when you received it, you can look up previous USD values manually or upload your trades into specific crypto tax calculators to automate the process.\nWill I Be Audited if I Don\u2019t Report my Cryptocurrency Gains and Losses?\nObviously, no one can answer this question for certain. Audits do not happen very often for average citizens; however, as noted above, the IRS has explicitly stated that the taxation of virtual currencies is one of its core campaigns and focuses for the year. Staying on the right side of the law and avoiding tax fraud is a safe way to go.\nRest assured, it really is not that difficult of a process to report your crypto trades. If you have questions regarding IRS audits or your specific situation, it can be helpful to connect with a specialized crypto accountant.\nI Didn\u2019t Report My Cryptocurrency Transactions During Previous Years. What Should I Do?\nIf you did not report your cryptocurrency trades in previous years, you should amend your previous tax returns to accurately report these numbers. The IRS is retroactively going back as far as 2013 in audits against cryptocurrency non-compliance.\nMy Employer Pays My Wages in Virtual Currency. Do I Need to Report This On My Taxes?\nYes. Wages paid via cryptocurrency are treated as income for tax purposes. You will need to report this income by using the fair value of the cryptocurrency at the time you earned it. You can identify historical values automatically by importing your crypto income into crypto tax software.\nThis is a guest post by David Kemmerer, co-founder of CryptoTrader.Tax.

He explained that using the Tor integration before creating a new wallet can shield a user\u2019s identity beyond the fact that they are not required to provide any personal information. With Tor, Samourai\u2019s servers will not be able to see a user\u2019s IP address when they connect to the API, only their Bitcoin addresses, thus protecting the one piece of information that could tie their wallet to their real-world identity.\nHe also noted that Tor-enabled connectivity paves the way for Samourai\u2019s forthcoming Whirlpool mixing services and full-node Dojo offering, two more privacy-enhancing features.\n\u201cOur users have been requesting tighter Tor integration for some time,\u201d TD explained. \u201cIt was a prerequisite for rolling out Whirlpool and Dojo.\u201d\nWhirlpool is Samourai\u2019s implementation of ZeroLink, a coin-mixing protocol that has been anticipated since 2017. ZeroLink\u2019s protocol demands the use of Tor, enabling Whirlpool to break chain analysis between incoming and outgoing coins. This shuffling helps to ensure privacy and further secure anonymity of the origin source of an outgoing transaction.\nSamourai\u2019s wallet-specific full node, Dojo, has been tailor-made to run over a Tor-only connection. This further establishes privacy, as the personal Dojo will include backend APIs that allow the Samourai Wallet to connect to the Dojo directly, bypassing the company\u2019s own servers. The intent is to provide greater security and verification measures for users.

A live hearing was held on March 27, 2019, to pass the initiative and it went off without a hitch, Poliakov said.\n\u201cThe staff, councils and mayor of the town of Innisfil are extremely forward thinking and innovative,\u201d Poliakov enthused. \"Coinberry approached the town with a proposal to start accepting property taxes in cryptocurrency and, after several months of discussions, we were able to make Bitcoin history in Canada yesterday!\u201d\nCoinberry is poised to play an integral role for Innisfil residents who utilize the new option.\u201cPayments will be processed through Coinberry Pay, a cryptocurrency payment processing solution developed by Coinberry for use by municipalities, charities, merchants and individuals looking to accept payments, donations or tips in cryptocurrency,\u201d Poliakov said.\nThe payment solution is hosted by Coinberry but taxpayers will have to go through a government website to pay their taxes. Once a payment is processed through Coinberry, the exchange will convert it to Canadian dollars and then pass it on to Innisfil's municipal government.Poliakov told Bitcoin Magazine that the trend has a chance to catch on with neighboring towns as well, and his hopes are to eventually encourage the city council of Toronto to adopt the option. But he and other proponents won't truly be satisfied until the Bitcoin bug bites every layer of Canada's political system \u2014 all the way up to the federal level.\n\u201cThe goal with Coinberry Pay in general, and with the current initiative specifically, is to bring about the mass adoption of cryptocurrency as a method of payment in Canada,\u201d said Poliakov. \u201cWe are in discussion with a number of parties both within government and the private sector to utilize our solution. Our goal at Coinberry is to make crypto simple \u2014 we will continue to expand our cryptocurrency payment processing service to municipalities and other government agencies in the near future. We truly believe in the benefits of mass adoption of cryptocurrency and are working very hard to make that a reality.\u201d\nTo start, bitcoin will be the only available cryptocurrency option for citizens to break the fiat tax barrier, but Poliakov said that Coinberry Pay will be adding ether, litecoin, ripple and bitcoin cash soon, as well.\nThe initiative is a significant win for both Canadian citizens and the cryptocurrency industry and, given that an exchange spearheaded the initiative, it\u2019s likely restored some community trust in the industry following the ongoing QuadrigaCX debacle. With a municipal government choosing to place its trust in both Coinberry and bitcoin, the industry and its flagship asset is one step closer to achieving greater understanding and de-stigmatization with the populace at large.\n\u201cOnce again, we are proud to be first in taking this bold step by offering this new, exciting payment option to our residents,\u201d Innisfil Mayor Lynn Dollin said in a press release. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that cryptocurrency is growing in usage and popularity.

One of the most interesting things emerging from this particular bear market has been a concept known as \u201cdecentralized finance,\u201d manifested primarily by services that allow you to earn interest or borrow against your cryptocurrency holdings.\nWhat Is DeFi?\nDecentralized finance, or \u201cDeFi\u201d for short, is an umbrella concept describing any financial services that are built on top of public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It also encompasses all ICO activity, which, at present, mostly takes place on Ethereum.\nStablecoins like Tether and Gemini dollar, which are essentially just IOUs for fiat sitting in reserves, do not qualify as DeFi projects by their inherent nature. Maker, on the other hand, includes both a collateralized lending system and stablecoin (DAI) that are both decentralized \u2014 making it more of a fit under the DeFi umbrella.\nSeveral systems have emerged that also offer DeFi lending services like Dharma Lever, Compound and Celsius Network. Other services, like dYdX and Nuo, allow you to short, hedge or margin trade. Prediction markets are also an emerging decentralized financial service, with Augur being the most relevant example. Consistent among all of these services, and all that decentralized finance has to offer, is that it requires no third party, bank or clearing house, and often is entirely permissionless.\nDeFi and Bitcoin\nBitcoin itself, at the most basic level, may be considered the original decentralized finance project. People who use Bitcoin are already acting as their own banks (as long as they control their own private keys) and can permissionlessly exchange value with whomever they want, anywhere. While this the simplest form of decentralized finance, it may also be the most powerful. Bitcoin users are able to open up \u201cbank accounts,\u201d or new wallets, in seconds. They can securely store their wealth in a value that is protected by mathematics from random inflation and can spend this value however they want.\nThe question of whether or not more sophisticated, decentralized financial services will migrate to Bitcoin is not a matter of if, but when. Over time, Bitcoin sidechains may be able to provide services similar to what we are seeing on Ethereum. Today, however, Ethereum is much better designed to handle DeFi services due to its complex smart contract capabilities.\nNonetheless, new projects are already being envisioned on Bitcoin, like Bitcoin Hivemind. According to the website, Hivemind is a \u201cPeer-to-Peer Oracle Protocol which absorbs accurate data into a blockchain so that Bitcoin users can speculate in Prediction Markets.\u201d\nWhy Is DeFi Growing?\nDecentralized finance is becoming popular for several key reasons, which are all parallel to the ethos of Bitcoin itself. There are no banks on which people need to rely, no trust is needed to interact with the other party, access is available 24/7 and settlements are relatively fast.\nAnd the numbers speak for themselves. As of March 2019, the amount of value locked in DeFi projects stands at $338 million, according to Delphi Digital\u2019s thematic overview of DeFi. The research firm\u2019s overview showcases the popular DeFi services, which they categorize by \u201cDEXs,\u201d \u201cLending and Borrowing\u201d protocols and \u201cDerivatives, Margin Trading, & Prediction Markets.\u201d\nDelphi also cited potential benefits of DeFi as being permissionless, censorship resistant, immutable, programmable and offering minimal counterparty risk. An important note, however, is that the report did not address the potential systematic risks of decentralized finance. Rather, it cited only near-term concerns, which touch on the notion that decentralized finance results in \u201cnon-existent links to physical/traditional assets\u201d as well as \u201climited on-chain throughput\u201d and \u201climited product/market fit.\u201d", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 29}

The S17 set of miners includes the Antminer S17 Pro, Antminer S17 and the Antminer T17.\nThe Antminer S17 is the latest in the company\u2019s line of fabless mining chips. According to the post, the chips, which are expected to go on sale from April 9, 2019, will provide an energy-efficient means of mining popular cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and bitcoin cash.\nThe miners will be fitted with the 2nd generation 7nm ASIC BM1397 mining chips which Bitmain claims would provide a 28.6 percent improvement in power efficiency.\nAccording to Yanxin, Bitmain\u2019s product manager, the improved energy efficiency of the S17 miners will lead to \"improved performance compared to the previous generation chip\" and the increase in the \"hashrate density per unit space,\" which reduces costs for mining farms.\nA Fortuitous Launch Date?\nThe timing of the S17 series launch appears to be following a strategic pattern. The Bitcoin halving is projected to hit in May 2020, just over a year after the new miners become available. The ASIC hardware producer used a similar strategy in introducing the Antminer S9 model in 2016.\nThe halving sees to it that the reward given to a miner for mining a block is halved after the discovery of every 210,000 blocks (which takes about four years on average). Some expect that there could be a renewed bull run leading to the third halving, which will see the block rewards reduced from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC.\nBitmain\u2019s planned launch of its next-generation S17 series miners wil allow it to capitalize on this expected bull run, which could be fueled by an increased desire to mine bitcoin (before the rewards are cut in half).\nBitmain\u2019s Challenges\nThe Chinese crypto mining giant has been widely reported to be struggling in the last few months. The latest blow to the company was the expiration of its Initial Public Offering (IPO) filing, which was triggered by the lack of a hearing from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEx).\nAs Bitcoin Magazine reported, the listing rules from the Chinese financial regulator provide for a six-month consideration window and a closed-door committee hearing before approval is given to an IPO application.\nIf an applicant doesn\u2019t get a response from the regulator after this period, then the application automatically lapses.", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 29}

Its goal is to bridge the communication gap between the Chinese community and the outside world. News, policy analysis... everything you want to know about crypto in China is here. \nThis article was originally published by 8btc and written by Lylian Teng.\nThe Chinese security service provider 360 Security has issued a warning that a large number of crypto exchanges have been targeted by the North Korean hacker group Lazarus and that the number is still rising after the recent hacks of crypto exchanges DragonEx, Etbox and BiKi.\n360 Core Security found that Lazarus, also known as the ATP-C-26 group, used software called \u201cWorldbit-bot\u201d to carry out its active attacks. The crypto exchange DragonEx fell victim to it on March 24, 2019, leading to a loss of $7.09 million, according to the 360 Security report.\nThe analysis by the 360 Advanced Threat Response Team detailed that the attacking group registered two domains, wb-invest.net and wb-bot.org, last October in preparation for the attacks. Then they faked the cryptocurrency trading software Worldbit-bot based on the open-sourced \u201cQt Bitcoin Trader,\u201d which was embedded with malicious code. The malicious software was then camouflaged within a regular automated crypto trading platform under the domains of wb-invest.net and wb-bot.org, which kept normal operation for half a year.\n\n\nDomain wb-invest.net and wb-bot.org registered in October 2018.\n\n\n\nFaked cryptocurrency trading software \u201cWorldbit-bot\u201d based on the open-sourced \u201cQt Bitcoin Trader.\u201d\n\n\n\nWorldbit-bot runs under the domain of wb-invest.net and wb-bot.org.\nThe attackers targeted a large number of internal staff at cryptocurrency exchanges for the software promotion. The latest phishing attacks took place in January and March 2019.\nAccording to China-based JohnWick Security, which has been assisting DragonEx in investigating its hacking incident, the customer service staff at DragonEx appear to have opened an installation package named wbbot.dmg from an unknown source. Analysis indicates a backdoor was embedded in the installation package, through which hackers acquired the internal staff\u2019s authorization and then obtained the wallet private key.\nThe \u201cWorldbit-bot\u201d software operates in much the same manner, with the faked crypto trading software \u201cCelas Trade Pro,\u201d and was detected by the same team at 360 Security last August. Users of Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Bitmarket, BTCChina, GOC.io, Indacoin, OKCoin, WEX and Y0bit were susceptible to the threat at that time.\nFirst, the process information is collected and encrypted:\n\n\n\nSystem information is collected:\n\n\n\nMalicious codes are executed and decrypted for file execution:\n\n\n\nThe security company is recommending that crypto exchanges be on the lookout for warning signs such as abnormal exchange earnings, tampered addresses of cold and hot wallets, large sum transfers and multiple account logins for coin withdrawal.\nLazarus is an infamous hacking group backed by North Korea. According to research, the group\u2019s earliest attack may have been associated with \u201cOperation Flame,\u201d a large-scale DDOS attack on the South Korean government website in 2007. Lazarus is also alleged to have been the group behind the Sony Pictures hacking incident of 2014, the Bank of Bangladesh data breach of 2016 and the \u201cWannacry\u201d ransomware attack that swept across the globe in 2017. Since 2017, the group has been expanding its targets of attack, increasingly aiming them at a variety of economic interests. In earlier attacks, the group mainly targeted the banking systems of traditional financial institutions. Now, it has begun to attack global cryptocurrency businesses and individuals.\nAs previously reported, Lazarus is purportedly responsible for $571 million of the $882 million in cryptocurrency that was stolen from exchanges from 2017 to 2018, almost 65 percent of the total amount.

During the demonstration, Weis pointed out that the maximum withdrawal limit is 20 HKD, roughly $2.55 USD or 0.00061893 BTC. Leo Weese, who organized the hackathon, was able to make a similar withdrawal.\nMost Bitcoin ATMs that exist today do not execute as quickly as Weis\u2019s modified one did in the video, not because they don\u2019t utilize Lightning but because they often require some form of know-your-customer (KYC) compliance that delays the process by requiring users to visit a website and provide their personal information as they would on a custodial exchange.\nA Different Kind of Bitcoin ATM\nA Lightning-enabled Bitcoin ATM as demonstrated by Weis could provide several key advantages over its predecessors. With the average Bitcoin ATM, customers looking to withdraw a typical amount of bitcoin will need to wait at least a few minutes before receiving it, over which the value of the withdrawn amount might fluctuate slightly.\nWhile this may not significantly affect a customer\u2019s purchasing power, a Lightning-enabled Bitcoin ATM offers a significant advantage in this department due to its near-instantaneous payment delivery. Lightning enables bitcoin micropayments and, coupled with the rapid speed of a Lighting transaction, a Lightning-enabled ATM allows for satoshi-level invoice precision. In other words, customers can withdraw a precise amount as close to the fiat conversion rate as possible and receive it in essentially real time.\nAs Weis told Bitcoin Magazine, one \u201cmajor benefit of the Lightning Network\u201d integration on Bitcoin ATMs would be instant withdrawals on two-way machines. This contrasts with on-chain transactions which \u201ccan take from minutes to hours if the customer (unknowingly) chose a low mining fee.\u201d\nStill, there are a few speed bumps in the way of bringing Lightning to every Bitcoin ATM. Weis told Bitcoin Magazine that, in order for this to be implemented in other ATMs, ATM operators will have to run their own Lightning nodes and make sure they have enough in- and outbound liquidity. In addition, he said that the current software does not accommodate instantaneous withdrawals but that he hopes to code this functionality \u201cvery soon.\u201d\nWeis said that his plugin is compatible with any General Bytes Bitcoin ATM in Hong Kong, a hardware and software company that produces Bitcoin-related products.", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 1}

Gox, guilty of record tampering but innocent on other charges related to embezzlement and breach of trust.\nPer reports in the Wall Street Journal, the court's verdict is a massive blow to Japanese prosecutors who have maintained their stance that Karpeles was guilty of embezzlement and breach of trust at Mt. Gox.\nThe sentence, which was carried out on March 15, will see him serve a suspended sentence of two-and-half years in prison. He can skip jail altogether if he stays on his best behavior.\nWhile prosecutors pushed for a 10-year prison sentence, the court rebuffed some aspects of their claims and handed down a more lenient sentence.\nHow Things Went Sideways for Karpeles\nKarpeles was the head of Mt. Gox when the firm applied for bankruptcy protection in 2014, following a security breach, where 850,000 Bitcoin (BTC), worth about 48 billion Yen ($430 million) at the time, was stolen from the exchange\u2019s vaults.\nHe was subsequently arrested in 2015, following an accusation that he embezzled 341 million Yen (about $3 million) from the accounts of customers.\nPer the allegations, he was alleged to have transferred the money from the accounts of the company\u2019s customers directly into his own, using the funds to bankroll a lavish lifestyle.\nThe transfers were made with the use of his personal computer, then he went a step further, covering his tracks by falsifying the company\u2019s records.\nMt. Gox\u2019s Poor Accounting System Might Have Saved Him\nThe falsification of records was a major bone of contention for the court. In its ruling, the court pointed out that by falisfying records, Karpeles acted beyond the limits of his authority and against the general interests of the company.\nProsecutors took issue with Karpeles' decision to use a section of the supposedly embezzled funds to purchase a business that deals in 3D printers. However, the court pointed out that the acquisition could be viewed as a potential asset for the company and thus, it was seen as reasonable.\nThe court also pointed out that Mt. Gox lacked an efficient accounting system for when company executives borrowed money from the company, claiming that this made it impossible to determine whether the supposed funds Karpeles was said to have embezzled were from the company\u2019s clients.\nIn his remarks, Presiding Judge Tomoyuki Nakayama stated that a data manipulation of this magnitude eroded the credibility of crypto exchanges. Pointing out Karpeles\u2019 position and IT expertise, the judge asserted that there is no justification for such an abuse of information.\nKarpeles Isn\u2019t Going to Jail, But There\u2019s Still Trouble Brewing for Him\nWhile Karpeles seems to have scored a win here, things could still go sour for him.\nEarlier this week, a court in Illinois ruled against his attempt to dismiss a class action lawsuit against him and the exchange.\nThe suit, which was brought up by some victims of the exchange\u2019s hack, was upheld by Judge Gary Feinerman because it was filed within the appropriate jurisdiction; even though the exchange was based in Japan.\nThe plaintiffs accused Karpeles of painting an untrue picture of the exchange\u2019s stability and security, as well as demonstrating negligence that led to their funds being stolen.\nIf found guilty, Karpeles could be compelled to make compensation and damages payments.", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 15}

Dubbing Canaan Creative as the second-largest mining firm in the world, the publication notes that the funding has raised the company\u2019s overall valuation to $1 billion.\nThis influx of capital comes after an explosive period of growth for the industry\u2019s second-largest mining manufacturer. According to Securities Times, the company sold 9,727 units in 2015, a number that would grow thirtyfold to 295,000 in 2017. Its 2015 sales generated some $7.1 million in revenue and $2.25 million in net profit. By 2017, its sales would rake in $193 million in revenue and $53.8 million in net profit.\nThese numbers, which surfaced from a Canaan Creative IPO prospectus that failed to substantiate into an actual sale after the application expired, show that the company\u2019s position is encroaching on Bitmain\u2019s territory.\nAs detailed by financial disclosures Bitmain made to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in preparation for its own IPO, the company took in $82 million in profit in 2017. However, CoinDesk reports that in an updated IPO prospectus, the firm posted roughly $500 million in losses for Q3 of 2018, endangering its prospects for a successful public offering.\nThe bear market is mainly to blame for Bitmain\u2019s struggles, along with the fact that the company funneled much of its capital and crypto holdings into bitcoin cash (BCH). As revealed in the company\u2019s original IPO prospectus, the company began accumulating bitcoin cash from the forked coin\u2019s inception in 2017 through 2018, increasing its holdings to over 1 million BCH during the two-year period.\nAs Blockstream CSO Samson Mow pointed out on Twitter, given bitcoin cash\u2019s price depreciation, this would account for some $500 million in losses. This could potentially be the source of losses as detailed in the updated prospectus, and these losses have likely worsened as bitcoin cash\u2019s value was basically cut in half by its own coin split in November, while also suffering from the market\u2019s overall decline in the same month.\nWith Bitmain\u2019s finances in decline, Canaan Creative\u2019s growth has it pulling closer than ever before to Bitmain\u2019s first place in the industry. Ebang, another top Chinese mining firm, announced its own IPO around the same time as Bitmain, though the bearish market and thinning returns also have the company reporting 2018 losses. The Securities Times coverage of Canaan Creative\u2019s latest funding round did not disclose the company\u2019s 2018 numbers.\nAt the time of publication, Canaan Creative had not responded to Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s request for comment.", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 13}

The upward drift is bringing us slowly to a level that was previously rejected violently:\n\n\n\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Upward Drift\nOur third rejection of the red resistance level shown above brought the market into a test of macro support in the mid-$3,000s. After several tests of the support level, the market began to slowly drift upward in a stair-stepping manner. This upward drift is a change of character in price action. Prior to this drift, the market was quite volatile, with both upward and downward impulses. The three prior rejected tests shot into the level aggressively (a sign of strong demand) but got spat out aggressively (a sign of strong supply). Our fourth time is quite different, though \u2014 rather than shoving into the level aggressively, it is slowly grinding. Slow upward grinds are often a sign of weakening supply and persistent demand.\nSo far, our market has managed to hold macro support and has even managed to hold above the previously rejected level (outlined in black in Figure 1). Now, we are beginning to see the real test of supply as we enter the prior levels that were rejected:\n\n\n\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Prior Rejected Levels\nIf we look at the rejected levels individually, we can form discrete layers of resistance that the market will need to overcome if the bulls are going to overwhelm the market\u2019s supply. At the time of this writing, we are in the process of testing the lowest level (shown by the red dashed line in Figure 2). A decisive close above that level would be a nice step as this slow grind is trapping more and more shorters that are beginning to fade the market move. If the market clears the lowest low, it will then enter into the red zone outlined above. This zone will likely see a lot of volatility as it has historically been a strong point of resistance. However, something to note is that this level is also a logical place for short-sellers to place their stops. If we see a strong move into this level, it\u2019s entirely possible that we\u2019ll see a short squeeze as shorters begin to close out their positions (willfully or forcefully).\nAnother characteristic of this drift that is important to note is the volume. The volume throughout this drift has been constant and the selling pressure has been relatively weak:\n\n\n\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Constant Volume\nSteady volume accompanied by upward-drifting markets is often a sign of not only bearish exhaustion, but also supply absorption. Supply absorption is simply the act of soaking market supply like a sponge without aggressively pushing the market upward. It\u2019s a passive accumulation technique that baits people into selling prematurely.\nWhile we are still in the process of testing overhead resistance, this change of character in our market looks pretty bullish. The bullish trend will slowly confirm itself over the next few days/weeks if we manage to clear the overhead levels outlined above. For now, we need to see how the market reacts to all of the overhead levels and how the market treats bearish pressure. If we manage to close above the overhead resistance level, there is very little stopping the market from breaking out and seeing a sizable markup in price.\nSummary:\nThe market has continued its slow upward drift into overhead resistance. Slowly but surely, we are testing all the resistance.This upward drift is a change of character as the market has seen strong bouts of volatility leading into the drift. Now, however, we are grinding upward through each discrete resistance level.If we manage to close above the band of overhead resistance, we can expect to see a strong continuation of the uptrend as this would represent a break of market structure, and a breakout of strong overhead resistance.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

This clarification will likely embolden Tether\u2019s more staunch opponents, who have argued that Tether is insolvent. While there\u2019s never been any evidence to suggest that Tether does not have the reserves to back the coins in circulation, the company has routinely refused to submit to a formal audit, opting instead for attestations from a law firm in the past.\nThis update seems to at least lend credence to these insolvency concerns, which have been most thoroughly vetted by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin who released a report with a thesis that hinges on the belief that Tether\u2019s issuance inflated the market during the 2017 bull run. It should be noted that this report has been refuted by other academics who took issue with the professors\u2019 methodology.\nStill, Tether claims that there are more than enough assets in its coffers to cover circulating supply. On its transparency page, the company records that it has $23 million more assets under its name than liabilities.\n\u201cFrom time to time, Tether reviews its Terms of Service and Risk Disclosures to ensure that they remain appropriate and up to date. Our most recent revisions were intended to update our disclosures to reflect Tether\u2019s growth and operations and to be consistent with the types of disclosures used by other institutions,\u201d a Bitfinex team member told Bitcoin Magazine, responding on behalf of Tether.\n\u201cThe only change is that the composition of the assets that provide that backing includes a combination of cash, cash equivalents, and may also include other assets or receivables from loans issued by Tether,\u201d they concluded.\nWith the language presented on the website and by this representative, Tether\u2019s assertion that its backing may include \u201ccash equivalents\u201d and \u201cother assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties\u201d reads like fractional reserve banking practices. This modern banking practice, which some believe helped to precipitate the 2008 financial crisis, allows banks to hold only a portion of its customer deposits on site, opting instead to loan the overwhelming majority of these funds to institutions and generate debt in place of physical assets.\n\u201cFractional reserve banking is a banking system in which only a fraction of bank deposits are backed by actual cash on hand and are available for withdrawal. This is done to expand the economy by freeing up capital that can be loaned out to other parties,\u201d Investopedia explains.\nThe fear of many Tether detractors is that the company is running a fractional reserve, a concern that was aggravated by the apparent inability to redeem USDT for cash through Tether\u2019s website or Bitfinex, an exchange run by the same management as Tether. Tether\u2019s cash portal, however, has reportedly been up-and-running since late 2018.\nGiven that the market\u2019s largest stablecoin has been so opaque in its operations, the controversy surrounding Tether has provided fertile ground for competition. Through 2017\u20132018, there was a proliferation of fiat-backed stablecoins like TrueUSD, Gemini USD, USD Coin and the Paxos Standard, all of which are attempting to be an institutional and regulation grade alternative to the market\u2019s first fiat stablecoin.\nTo bolster their credibility, the companies behind these coins have employed some of the U.S.\u2019s top accounting firms to run an audit of their business and finances, something that Tether\u2019s own executives have called impossible in the past, given the stigmatized nature of cryptocurrency companies.", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 14}

Essentially, this means users can now broadcast data via the company\u2019s satellite network and pay with Lightning payments.\nNo Internet? No Problem\nBlockstream's satellite service was established with the aim of replacing the Bitcoin network's dependence on land-based internet connections with actual satellites, thereby putting the network within reach of the world's population.\nAccording to the blockchain-based startup, the satellite network makes 24-hour broadcasts of the Bitcoin network all over the world, ensuring that the blockchain is protected from interruptions, providing users around the world with the ability to access Bitcoin with the use of a satellite receiver instead of an internet connection.\nTransmitting Data via Blockstream\nDevelopers can use Blockstream's RESTful API or can submit their messages through the website. Using the website to send messages is quite straightforward. The user has to select the \u201cBroadcast a Transmission\u201d option and upload the file (which could be encrypted, if it's intended to go to a specific user).\nThe next step is to bid for a price for transmission. The auction process determines the priority given to your transfer. Per the details on the site, the \"minimum bid is 50 mSat/byte. Use the minimum bid price or bid more to give your transmission higher priority in the queue.\"\nOnce a bid is chosen, the system will generate an authentication code and transmission ID, which can be used to \"delete or re-prioritize (bump) your transmission in the queue.\" Once these details are saved in a secure location, then payment is made via Lightning. Once the Lightning payment is made, the transmission will be queued.\nBlockstream's satellite service was launched back in 2017 with the aim of connecting Bitcoin users, particularly in areas where they struggle with low internet penetration and online freedom.\nUpon its launch, the satellite's focus was on transmitting messages to receivers in Europe, Africa and the Americas. The company further expanded to the Asia-Pacific region in December 2018, while adding support for Lightning network payments.\nAt the time, Blockstream CEO Adam Back said, \u201cWe see the increased robustness of the Bitcoin network and the lower cost of participation contributing to helping businesses rely on the service for backup and for emerging markets to use as their primary access to the Bitcoin network at a lower cost.\u201d\nWith the Lightning network service, the satellite messaging API will now allow users to send encrypted messages to each other from anywhere on Earth and make payments for receiving those messages.", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 13}

Put together by the student-organized MIT Bitcoin Club, the conference welcomed more than just Bitcoin voices from every corner of the industry. One of those voices was that of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce.\nPeirce sat down with Gary Gensler, ex-chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, senior lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management and senior advisor to the director of the MIT Media Lab, to discuss the progress of the SEC\u2019s efforts to regulate the cryptocurrency industry. Notably, Gensler and Peirce launched into a discussion on what regulators can do better to protect investors from fraud and malicious actors.\nBefore the debate began, both Gensler and Peirce expressed their appreciation for the emerging technology. \u201cIt\u2019s a new way to have tamper resistant data amongst the consensus of multiple parties,\u201d Gensler said. \u201cMy research is mostly around the business of blockchain technology and \u2026 trying to find where are the real use cases where traditional data structures don\u2019t work as well.\u201d\nPeirce expressed her own support for the space in relation to the SEC\u2019s ongoing efforts to properly regulate it. \u201cWe have rules on the books that we have to enforce, but on the other hand, we don\u2019t want to stop people from doing things that are going to make society a better place to live, that are going to make people\u2019s lives easier, and enable people to interact in ways that they have not been able to in the past.\u201d\nLater in the presentation, the two veteran regulators went on to discuss what the government can do to protect investors by possibly regulatinged cryptocurrency exchanges.\nGensler believes that \u201cexchanges are the gateway to get good public policy, particularly around AML laws, but also around investor protection.\u201d He continued, \u201cIn essence, that there\u2019s not a manipulated market with frontrunning and manipulation with the order books and the like.\u201d\nThe discourse was ongoing, and the most significant takeaway was that regulators like Peirce and the SEC acknowledge that, again, perhaps the current system of rules don\u2019t apply perfectly. How could securities-based regulations be placed on all cryptocurrencies, even those that are officially defined as not securities?\nThe SEC, according to Peirce, is working on what may be an alternative set of rules for exchanges that do not violate the rules of listing unregistered securities. Bitcoin, which is not a security, falls neatly into this alternative rule set. And, though it is currently unclear what the exact precedents will be, Peirce\u2019s thoughts around the subject at MIT\u2019s latest Bitcoin Expo were nothing short of encouraging for Bitcoin\u2019s regulatory future.\n\u201cPeople regulate each other in their interactions with one another, and that\u2019s sort of the whole purpose of the Bitcoin idea \u2026 that it would be this community that would be able to regulate itself. So as problems arise, people in the community are thinking about how to deal with those problems.\n\u201cI think these markets could regulate themselves if we lived in a world that allowed that,\u201d Peirce added.\nPeirce has made similar remarks about the SEC\u2019s awareness of the Bitcoin community\u2019s tendency to self-regulate in the past.\nGensler and Peirce also discussed the topic of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and what is being done to provide clarity to people participating in the once-booming phase. Peirce went on to explain that the SEC has already provided some clarity for investors who want to create a company, raise funds from investors and then distribute returns based on the company\u2019s performance. For these individuals, the existing securities rules will apply to their tokens.\nThere are, however, the countless number of tokens that claim to be used as a utility on the network they belong to, but originate through an ICO in which they accept funds from investors in exchange for these tokens. There are still a plethora of unanswered questions around these.\n\u201cThat\u2019s where we need to do a better job,\u201d Peirce said, \u201cin providing guidance in how does it change from one thing to another.\u201d Eventually, she said, the SEC wants to remove the big gray cloud hanging over these project\u2019s heads.\nOverall, the uplifting theme of the entire discussion could be summarized by an exchange between Peirce and a member of the audience, addressing the current system that discourages equal opportunity in retail participation.\nThe audience member asked, \u201cIt may be hubristic, but many of us are not independently wealthy and we still believe we can make good investment decisions, and right now we\u2019re excluded from participating. How can we move the accredited investor laws away from wealth thresholds and toward something that\u2019s far more reasonable and accessible to mainstream investors?\u201d\n\u201cOur accredited investors rules \u2026 I personally think those rules are not consistent with what this country is about,\u201d Peirce admitted, \u201cwhich is about people taking opportunities, taking their talents and intelligence and applying it to make their lives better. We\u2019ve put this artificial barrier in place so that people can\u2019t do that.\u201d\nAs far as whether or not these opinions will translate into legislature, time will tell.

Well, the wallet definitely exists. It\u2019s just missing a few features you might expect of a crypto wallet. Specifically, it doesn\u2019t support bitcoin \u2014 only ether and ERC20 tokens \u2014 which would be akin to your broker at Charles Schwab or Fidelity telling you that your 401(k) lets you invest in silver, copper and other metals but not gold.\nThe Wallet\nI bought my S10 yesterday and downloaded the wallet first thing this morning from Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Store (interestingly, it\u2019s not available on the Google Play Store). Upon setting up the wallet, the app asks for permissions, like access to your phone\u2019s calling function, storage, camera and body sensors, and it asks you to sign in with either a Samsung or Google account.\nI tried to take screenshots of the process, but when you try this, an error message reads: \u201cCan\u2019t take screenshots due to security policy.\u201d So there\u2019s a plus-one for mindful security practice even if the app\u2019s asking for access to your phone leaves you wary.\nSetting up the wallet is pretty standard procedure. You can either import an existing wallet using your seed phrase or create a new one. If creating a new one, you\u2019ll be asked to enter a 6-digit PIN, and after you confirm this PIN, you\u2019ll be given a 12-word seed phrase (aka recovery phrase or mnemonic phrase).\nThe device will warn you to store the phrase on another device (or, if you\u2019re being really security minded, offline entirely), adding that if you lose it, then your wallet will be lost to the blockchain abyss if you need to recover it for whatver reason (instances where you might need to recover your wallet: your phone gets broken, your phone gets stolen or Thanos secures all the Infinity Stones). The app also assures you that Samsung has no access to your wallet, but that anyone with your seed phrase does.\nAfter you promise that you\u2019ve written down the seed phrase safely like an obedient little enthusiast, like any responsible wallet, it will randomly select three of these words (numbered 1\u201312) for you to regurgitate to the app to prove that you didn\u2019t ignore the most important step in setting up a wallet.\nBitcoin When?\nOnce you\u2019ve done this, your wallet is set up and you can start sending and receiving ether and ERC20 tokens.\nYep, just Ethereum stuff: no bitcoin. The wallet comes with innate support for ether, TrueUSD, Basic Attention Token, Augur\u2019s REP, Chainlink, the Paxos Standard, Maker, USD Coin, BNB and ZRX, among others. You can also add a \u201ccustom token\u201d like you can for other Ethereum wallet services such as MyCrypto and MyEtherWallet: this means that you can tell the wallet to recognize any ERC20 token by entering its token contract address, its name, its symbol (ticker) and its decimals.\nIt also comes with intrinsic support for two dApps: the Enjin Coin wallet, the eponymous cryptocurrency for Korean gaming company Enjin; and the notorious CryptoKitties. Enjin has been touted as a token platform that will revolutionize in-game purchases and ownership (what amounts to tokenizing cosmetics, items and other content). CryptoKitties, depending on who you ask, is either a really cute crypto trend or the virtual reincarnation of Beanie Babies with even more irrational buyer\u2019s mania. It made headlines in 2017 when the dApp clogged up the Ethereum network.\nAccording to BREAKERMAG\u2019s coverage of the wallet, COSMEE, a cosmetic token that rewards users for things like reviews of beauty products, is also supported. The app reportedly features the CoinDuck payment portal for point-of-sale and merchant payments, as well.\nSamsung has given no indication as to why it chose to support only Ethereum out of the gate, and it has also given no promise or timeline for integrating bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in the future.", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 12}

While macro support has been tested three times recently, we have yet to test the overhanging macro resistance:\n\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Narrow Range\nThe blue zone outlined above shows a very strong zone of support that, over the last few weeks, has seen three strong tests and has led to a slowly upward-drifting market consolidation. Since re-establishing support, the market has yet to see a meaningful retest of the overhead resistance outlined above in the red dashed and solid lines. The immediate resistance sitting overhead has, historically, been a highly volatile period where supply has manifested and stifled any bullish pressure:\n\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Three Rejections\nThe black level outlined above represents the preliminary level that the market had tested prior to shoving to the red macro resistance levels. In Figure 2, we can see three clear tests followed immediately by three rejections. And now, after finding support on a major, macro level (the blue zone), we seem to be meandering upward into the immediate overhead black resistance.\nThis current move is considerably different from the prior moves. The three prior tests occurred very violently and were matched with overwhelmingly violent selling responses. Our fourth test, however, has been a slow, persistent grind. Upward drifts like this are often signs of weakening supply and, consequently, a weakening resistance level.\nWhile it is still early to tell and we have yet to actually establish support on this level, the early signs of bearish exhaustion are starting to surface as we make our way upward. If we manage to test and find support on the black level, it seems logical that the next step would be to test the level in the low $4,000s that has been rejected so many times previously.\nBecause we are stuck in the middle of a range, the market is pseudo-agnostic in terms of its market bias. It\u2019s a bit of a no-man\u2019s-land, so to speak. If we do see a rejection of our overhead level, we can fully expect a retest of the macro, blue support zone shown above. A failure to hold the blue zone would undoubtedly yield a test of our macro lows in the low $3,000s.\nWe need to see a bullish close either above our current resistance or below our current macro support before any meaningful market movement is realized. Until then, it is just chop-city as we ping-pong back and forth between the upper and lower boundaries of our range.\nSummary:\nBitcoin has continued to consolidate within its narrow range.The consolidation has an upward tilt to it that is causing us to slowly grind through a macro resistance level that has seen three strong rejections over the last three months.If we fail to break the overhead resistance and find support, we can expect a macro retest of the support level in the mid $3,000s. However, if we break out and find support, we can expect to see, at minimum, a retest of the low $4,000 area.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Last week, Japanese police reported that 2018 saw a tenfold increase of cryptocurrency money laundering. In 2017, Japan\u2019s National Police Agency discovered fewer than 700 instances of crypto money laundering. Last year, they found more than 7,000 cases. What is it about this new asset class, which is enabled by blockchain distributed ledger technology, that makes it so appealing to criminals? And what can be done to keep cryptocurrency clean?\nCryptocurrencies present the world with a radically new way of thinking about value. As a rule, there\u2019s no central issuer like a mint, no printed bills or stamped coins, and no government affiliation. Given these radical differences from traditional money and cryptocurrency advocates\u2019 concerns about institutions and centralization, some uncontroversial and long-established aspects of traditional finance have proven unpopular in the crypto world. One of the most important disputes, and the most central to stopping crime, is over anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations.\nIn addition to stymying money laundering, KYC/AML rules help combat illegal drug trade, halt terrorist financing, and prevent trafficking. Outside observers are sometimes surprised that such measures inspire resistance from the cryptocurrency world, but many of the technology\u2019s earliest adopters believed in full anonymity as a principle. Though absolute anonymity may have a theoretical appeal for some, it may cause more problems than it solves. When cryptocurrency exchanges are hacked, anonymity protects the perpetrators. When the Mt. Gox exchange was hacked in 2014, the hundreds of millions of dollars of \u201clost\u201d money could be traced to accounts, but those accounts could not be linked to individuals. Similarly, while anonymity can permit bad actors to execute money laundering, it makes price manipulation via pump-and-dump schemes far simpler. By making these activities possible, anonymity contributes to cryptocurrency\u2019s notorious volatility and makes it that much less likely that digital currencies will become stable stores of value.\nContrary to some arguments, KYC and AML are not \u201ccentralizing\u201d forces that corrupt the blockchain. Rather, they will lead to greater decentralization by inspiring greater faith in the network and encouraging new participants in blockchain technology. The blockchain community can be fractious, but if there\u2019s one thing almost universally agreed upon, it\u2019s that major financial institutions will shortly enter the market. The largest banks and financial firms, many of them centuries old, might be persuaded to invest in volatile assets, but they\u2019re far more reluctant to stake claims in sectors considered legally suspect. KYC and AML eliminate a substantial barrier to entry; their implementation could bring greater and safer investment to blockchain technology.\nRoughly half the world\u2019s population currently uses banking services; as developing economies emerge onto the world stage, the number of bank users will only grow. As globalization progresses, this newly banked population will cross oceans and borders, further increasing the already high demand for remittance payments and international money transfers. AML and KYC protocols enable banks to confidently invest in cryptocurrency and encourage their customers to do the same, thus opening cryptocurrency to half the world\u2019s population. Even the unbanked may benefit: bank involvement in cryptocurrency will inspire more robust infrastructure and more accessible interfaces for cryptocurrency trades, which might allow the unbanked to make their first investments and establish their financial reputations, so long as they have a cell phone and access to the internet.\nMuch of the international monetary framework rests on 40-year-old protocols and standards like SWIFT; there are periodic updates, upgrades, and adjustments, yet the system remains far slower than might be expected for one of the economic engines of the contemporary world. Cryptocurrencies are less than a quarter of SWIFT\u2019s age, but in the single decade they have existed, their speed, infrastructure, reliability and versatility have all experienced incredible growth and surpassed many of SWIFT\u2019s capabilities. With proper KYC and AML, there\u2019s every chance that cryptocurrencies could be used to transfer payments more quickly, securely and reliably than today; cryptocurrency could become an essential underpinning of the world financial system.\nThe rapid maturation of cryptocurrency \u2014 in 10 years, it has grown from a hypothetical on an obscure internet mailing list to a multi-billion dollar industry \u2014 has made legislators and regulators around the world take notice. All over the world, officials, many of whom lack tech experience, are beginning to craft and enforce cryptocurrency rules. In the United States, for example, the Securities and Exchange Commission has labeled blockchain and cryptocurrency a 2019 priority. Many other economic powerhouses have issued similar plans. With officialdom taking action, cryptocurrency should make the strategic decision to proactively implement the protections they expect to be codified. By working with legislators, rather than against them, they can ensure that eventual rulings are to the mutual benefit of industry and society.\nCryptocurrencies will not uniformly integrate KYC/AML by tomorrow or next week, but if there\u2019s anything that blockchain technology\u2019s first decade has taught, it\u2019s that the technology moves faster than expected or predicted. We may not know what exactly the future holds, or when precisely it might arrive, but there can be no doubt that cryptocurrency\u2019s future holds greater scrutiny, more reliability, far more adoption and far fewer crimes.\nThis is a guest post by Michael Ou, CEO of CoolBitX.

The level was tested three times prior and immediately rejected. Now, for the fourth time, we find ourselves situated above the level as we wait to see if our support holds:\n\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Fourth Test of Macro Resistance\nThe first three attempts to hold support above the black, broken resistance have been stifled with relatively high amounts of volume. However, something to note is that the three rejections of the overhead resistance have become weaker and weaker. Now, on our fourth attempt, we are doing so in a very meandering/drifting manner. Typically, impulsive moves (like the last three attempts) react with impulsive moves in response to the strong move into the level. Grinding moves, however, (like the fourth attempt we are currently experiencing) are often tactics used to trap early shorters and not allow them an opportunity to exit. This sort of position stacking often leads to a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d\nA short squeeze occurs when the market stacks a large amount of people trapped in a position without an opportunity to exit. As the market drifts upward, more and more people continue to short the market expecting a pullback. And, in some cases, the market continues to drift upward, causing these short positions to go deeper and deeper into a losing position.\nUltimately, these positions hit a breaking point where they will either be stopped out or force-liquidated, causing a large number of market buy orders to hit the market all at the same time. Right now, we have yet to experience the short squeeze, but we are laying the foundation to create a lot of trapped short positions in a relatively narrow price band:\n\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Upward Drift on Fourth Attempt\nThis upward drift has been persistent as we just ground right through the black resistance shown above. An upward grind like this can often be indicative of bearish exhaustion \u2014 especially when we have been strongly rejected several times before. At this level, it seems supply has been exhausted, and we will likely see a retest of the red zone shown below:\n\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Macro Resistance Zone\nThe red zone represents the maximum extent the market has been willing to extend itself prior to being rejected. When the market develops well-defined zones of resistance, it also develops, as a consequence, a tight band of logical stop losses that can be used to fuel either a bullish or bearish rally, depending on the context.\nIt seems logical that we will revisit this level whether the next major macro move is upward or downward. If we move upward, break new highs and fail to maintain new highs, that can be a bearish signal that large institutions are still unloading their supply and we are ready for a strong reversal.\nHowever, if we visit this zone and continue to grind upward, that could lead to a very powerful breakout of the level. Almost everyone who shorted over the last three to four months would have a logical stop order placed just above the red zone, and it could potentially cascade a short squeeze that would yield a very violent move to the upside.\nSummary:\nSo far, we are content to stair-step our way through local resistance levels and, for the time being, are finding support on the macro black level shown above.If we continue to hold this support level, we can expect to visit the low $4,000 level as this seems like a logical source of liquidity.A break of the red zone outlined in this article will likely yield a violent move to the upside as a short squeeze would fuel a bullish rally.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

On March 19, 2019, the company announced that it will allow customers to pay for goods and services using bitcoin and bitcoin cash. Crypto payment processor BitPay will facilitate the transactions.\nFounded in 1921, Avnet is one of the oldest major American electronics companies. With more than 15,000 employees and net income north of $250 million, it\u2019s also one of the country\u2019s larger technology firms. Today, its business centers around helping to design and manufacturer electronics for other companies.\nOn Tuesday, Avnet announced that the companies it works with can now pay for their goods and services using bitcoin and bitcoin cash.\nThe new payment options are available immediately, Sunny Trinh, the company\u2019s vice president of demand creation, told Bitcoin Magazine in an email. He added that the company has already \u201cclosed several multi-million-dollar transactions\u201d using cryptocurrency.\n\u201cOur customers have been asking to pay in cryptocurrency, and we listened,\u201d Trinh said. \u201cBitcoin gives our customers added flexibility, and we are excited to offer our customers the option to pay with bitcoin or bitcoin cash.\u201d\nAvnet\u2019s decision to begin accepting bitcoin and bitcoin cash reflects an effort to make it easier for businesses to purchase goods and services from the company by giving clients one less challenge to worry about during the difficult work of bringing new products to market.\n\u201cWe recognized that cryptocurrency would help our customers overcome the competition and challenges they face every day in taking their ideas from design to production,\u201d Trinh said. \u201cAnd we listened to our customers who said they would like the option to pay for our products and services with cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\u201cCryptocurrency is one more way we help our customers bring their products to market faster,\u201d he added.\nSonny Singh, chief commercial officer at BitPay, expressed a similar sentiment.

How do you share and educate both consumers and merchants on the power of bitcoin? I learned how much consumers loved earning and why merchants make decisions to adopt new technology.\u201d\nGiven his experience as an e-commerce professional, Alex Adelman, co-founder and CEO of Lolli, should know. After graduating from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2011, the entrepreneur started Cosmic, an e-commerce gateway \u201cwith the idea to democratize commerce, allowing anyone to buy anything anywhere,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine. The company, after an initial acquisition by PopSugar Inc., would end up in the hands of e-commerce cashback giant Ebates, and Adelman and his CTO, Matt Senter, would stay on staff after the buyout.\nNow, the duo are taking their experience working at Ebates and their original dream to \u201cdemocratize commerce\u201d to a new network of technology and clientele: Bitcoin.\nFrom Cash Back to Sats Back\nWhile working at Ebates, Adelman told us that he learned \"why people buy, how people use cashback programs\" \u2014 the hows and whys that would eventually lay the foundation for building Lolli's bitcoin-back platform.\nFrom craft beer memberships to VPNs to clothing, you can shop for just about anything on Lolli, though Adelman says travel is the most popular category (this is perhaps due to the fact that most airline booking sites, like CheapOAir, give a flat rate in bitcoin back rather than a percentage).\nLike Ebates\u2019 own model, Lolli\u2019s is simple and enticing: Shop online with Lolli\u2019s participating retailers and earn a variable amount of bitcoin back as a reward. Launched just six months ago, the platform already has 10,000 active users, Adelman told Bitcoin Magazine, and it\u2019s struck up partnerships with retail and online service leaders like Walmart, Overstock and Bookings.com. These are just a few names out of the 500 partners Lolli has brought to the platform as it continues to sprout and grow.\nThe seeds for the company were sown over five years ago when Adelman was on a trip to New York while he was still building Cosmic. He was couch surfing at the time while navigating the choppy waters of New York\u2019s sea of industry, attempting to form partnerships and secure capital for his first startup.\nAdelman said he doesn't like the \"Hollywood-ization\" of those moments when the entrepreneurial light bulb clicks on and a business idea shines forth. But he also said that, if he could pick a moment when the initial spark for Lolli's conceptualization was kindled, it was one fateful night at a New York bar when he met the soon-to-be co-founder of Blockstack, Ryan Shea.\n\"A couple of years into [Cosmic], we learned about bitcoin. On a trip to New York, I bumped into Ryan Shea randomly through a friend of a friend at a bar, and he had just learned about bitcoin and he talked my ear off for like three hours. And everything he said resonated with me,\u201d Adelman said.\n\"Everyone has that friend or that moment. I was obsessed. Everything we were building was on top of fiat rails and all breakages we were seeing were with payments. We were getting taxed by every single one of these layers that has no real purpose or reason.\"\nStill, it would take years of careful deliberation and focus before Adelman and Senter would go full bitcoin with Lolli. Adelman's glad they waited, telling Bitcoin Magazine that he doesn't think they \"would have had the same success if we tried to implement it five years ago.\"\nOriginally, though, the team wasn't going to build it for Bitcoin. After leaving Ebates, Adelman said that he and Matt toyed with Solidity to see if they could build a DApp for this use case. He was on a bit of an altcoin kick, he admits, and thought that Ethereum might be a good fit for the platform. That was until he took a walk in Washington Square Park with friend and fellow Bitcoiner Arjun Balaji.\n\"I was talking about some of the stuff we were building in Solidity and he asked pretty bluntly, 'When's the last time you read the Satoshi Whitepaper?' And truthfully, I hadn't read it in a couple years. It's so basic, so I felt like I knew it,\" he said.\n\"I read it again, and it hit me like this source of truth. And speaking candidly, I said, \u2018What am I doing? Everything's in Bitcoin. That's where it starts.\u2019\"\n\"So I started the concept for this idea that was so simple: Ebates but for bitcoin. Giving people cash back in the form of bitcoin as a way to distribute bitcoin to more people.\"\nBetween Adelman's background of marketing Cosmic to retailers over the last seven years and Senter\u2019s developing skills, \"all these things beautifully came together, and Matt and I just started building.\"\nMatt hammered out a prototype in \"about two weeks,\" and Adelman began shopping around this beta to some retailers.\nTurning Holders into Spenders\nToday, Lolli continues to grow and, as it grows, Adelman believes that not only will it bring more people into the bitcoin ecosystem to passively earn the cryptocurrency, but it will eventually convert holders into users. Then, the companies that participate in the sats-back program will be incentivized to accept bitcoin as more users leverage the program and show interest in spending their bitcoin on actual services.\n\"The next stage \u2014 these earners are going to become spenders. Once they hold bitcoin, they're going to want to spend it.\"\nFor now, though, he says that the retailers are just happy to have the additional coverage. It wasn\u2019t hard to convince them to play ball, he told us, because much like with Ebates, the cost is negligible and can be seen as a marketing expense. Lolli drives users to their sites because, as with its cash-back predecessor, \u201cpeople are loyal to [the service], not the particular brands.\u201d\nAfter these users purchase goods on these sites, Lolli receives a commission from that purchase and they credit the user\u2019s account with bitcoin that the company buys from \u201ctop OTCs,\u201d Adelman said. He emphasized that all user information is anonymized (the retailers don\u2019t see names, only user IDs when someone shops using the service) and that Lolli does not make money by selling data, a misconception that the company has been crusading against online.\nWhen asked whether or not the platform would expand to other cryptos, Adelman said he\u2019s a big believer in free markets, and that people can spend their bitcoin or trade it for other cryptos if they wish. So, for now, he\u2019s loyal to bitcoin, and he would rather focus on enriching the platform\u2019s functionality before adding support for other coins.\nIn the works, for instance, is a category search function that will allow users to type in the item or services they\u2019re searching for on the site to streamline their search. Until that feature is ready, customers can reach out to Lolli customer support to request an item and they will search for participating retailers to find the best deal for you. Adelman believes that this human factor and customer service will ultimately allow his new company to outcompete the legacy cashback company he came from.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about good branding. We want people to associate good customer service with bitcoin. And if we can do that, it\u2019ll mean more people defaulting to Lolli for bitcoin over Ebates in the long run.\"", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 18}

Exchanges must consider whether their interactions with users create a derivative contract or futures contract.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cNon-security tokens trading on Canadian exchanges may be derivatives and still subject to regulation \u2026 this is a really detailed set of consultation questions, comments from industry due May 15.\u201d\nLawyer Evan Thomas, who headed up a legal team at Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP to produce a summary of the CSA consultation paper, told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cA big issue with this proposal is that it is not clear as a legal matter that Canadian securities regulators have jurisdiction to regulate platforms for trading bitcoin and other crypto-assets that are not securities.\u201d\nOne of the goals stated in the Osler paper is:\n\u201cTo ensure that the CSA does not exceed its jurisdiction over the cryptoasset industry, we are hopeful that Platform regulation will provide further clarity regarding types of cryptoassets and related services that are not subject to securities regulation, such as tokens that are not investment contracts or derivatives and non-custodial cryptocurrency wallets.\u201d\nThird Time Lucky?\nThe Canadian government has conducted two previous consultation rounds with the cryptocurrency industry (in 2014 and 2018) but Thomas, who is cautiously optimistic, notes that this new initiative is a more direct response to cases like that of QuadrigaCX.\n\u201cEarlier regulation was directed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. This proposed framework is motivated by investor protection concerns; that is, trying to protect crypto users who use custodial exchanges from risks like hacking, embezzlement and market manipulation,\u201d Thomas explained.\nThe ghost of QuadrigaCX can be seen in the current discussion paper which asks: What operational requirements should be put in place to prevent a collapse like that of QuadrigaCX? What measures can affect market integrity, fair pricing, disclosure of conflict of interest and business continuity planning?\nWould the Proposed Regulations Have Prevented the QuadrigaCX Collapse?\nIt\u2019s an interesting question whether the proposed regulations in the discussion paper would have prevented what happened at QuadrigaCX \u2014 and the answer is likely no.\nAmber D. Scott, CEO of Outlier Canada, a cryptocurrency compliance consulting company, told Bitcoin Magazine that without adequate enforcement resources, it\u2019s unlikely the new rules would have affected the outcome.\n\u201cBackground checks for beneficial owners and executives are useful if they are sufficiently in-depth and acted upon. The QuadrigaCX story is interesting because they were registered with FINTRAC (Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada) at one point (though it's not clear whether they were up front in their application about the beneficial owners).\n\u201cSimilarly, proposed audits are useful tools, but I expect that fooling auditors would be possible, especially given that there will be very few experienced auditors that also understand crypto assets at this stage.\u201d\nShe added that, in many cases, the impact is likely to be a greater cost of compliance burden for companies that choose to operate within these frameworks, and very little for those that do not. \u201cIn my estimation, some of the most important (and lacking) resources are those needed to investigate and prosecute bad actors. Fraud is already illegal.\u201d\nClear Regulations Are Good for Crypto Business\nDespite this, a number of Canadian crypto exchanges, including Coinsquare and Coinberry, have said they would welcome clear, fair regulations that make it easier to be compliant and will help bring them into the financial mainstream.\nThe Osler paper highlights the positive benefits of regulation including better relationships with the banking sector:\n\u201cBy establishing a regulatory regime for Platforms, the Framework may make it easier for Platforms to obtain and maintain commercial relationships with banks and other financial institutions, which remains an ongoing challenge for certain Platforms.\u201d\nIn addition, clear regulations that apply to crypto asset securities dealers would be an opening for businesses that are currently flying under the radar.\n\u201cThe Framework potentially opens the door for Platforms that transact in cryptoassets that are securities or derivatives to operate within Canada in a compliant manner. Examples may include Platforms dealing in security tokens or tokenized assets, decentralized prediction markets or other so-called \u2018decentralized finance\u2019 (DeFi) activities.\u201d\nThe proposed regulations will apply to crypto platforms located in Canada, as well as foreign platforms with Canadian participants, which might be eligible for exemptions if they are appropriately regulated in their home jurisdiction.\nThe CSA is a federal government agency coordinating financial regulations for Canadian capital markets and IIROC is the industry\u2019s self-regulatory organization that oversees investment dealers in Canada\u2019s debt and equity markets.\nComments are due by May 15, 2019.", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 19}

Instead, the court said, banks need to consider the specific type and scope of crypto-related activity before determining whether or not to open an account.\nThe case involved a lawsuit begun in May 2018 by Israminers, a bitcoin mining company based in Ukraine, against the Union Bank of Israel. The bank refused to accept deposits into the company's account, and ultimately shut the account down because much of the money in the account was related to bitcoin.\nThe bank's position was that allowing crypto-related activity within accounts that it managed put it at risk of facilitating money laundering. As a result, it decided as early as 2014 to refuse to provide services related to virtual currencies.\nThe bank argued in court that it had notified the Supervisor of Banks, the Israeli government agency that oversees the banking industry, of its policy and was not told that it would pose a problem.\nHowever, in a March 17, 2019, ruling, judge Limor Bibi wrote that the bank's policy was too broad, according to the Israeli newspaper Calcalist. It is \"unreasonable,\" he wrote, for banks to adopt a \"sweeping policy\" under which they ban all activity related to bitcoin or other cryptocurrency.\nThat said, Bibi also wrote that banks are within their rights to refuse to provide services for customers operating in the crypto economy if a bank has a legitimate reason to believe that the customers might be seeking to launder money.\nIn short, then, the court upheld the right of banks to refuse to provide services for crypto-related activities if they might violate the law. But banks can't ban deposits or accounts simply because they involve crypto.\nBroadly speaking, the ruling aligns with the recommendations released earlier this month by Israel's financial regulator regarding the crypto economy. The report encourages the government to support crypto companies while emphasizing the importance of disclosures and oversight of crypto activity.", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 19}

The funds borrowed become collateral for the loan, upon which interest is paid.\nThe practice of margin trading for cryptocurrencies has become popular in recent years thanks to its potential for significant returns. Platforms such as BitMEX have offered massive leverage on margin trading, increasing their appeal to investors globally. But the potential high yield from such investments can also come with downsides, including the temptation to make large, risky investments with borrowed funds.\nProtecting Consumers in a Growing Market\nAccording to the report, the new rules will allow Japan to more closely monitor exchanges in a concerted effort to better protect consumers. Exchanges that offer margin trading and those that issue tokens through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) would be separated and regulated differently, for instance. The hope is that this categorization will enable the FSA to clamp down on scam investment opportunities, while also providing a healthy environment for the crypto industry to continue its growth.\nFor some time now, Japan\u2019s reputation as a crypto haven has been growing, thanks to its seemingly progressive stance on digital currencies.\nIn October 2018, the FSA approved the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA), a self-regulatory body that consists of 16 licensed crypto exchange platforms in the country. The group was given the authority to create regulatory guidelines for implementing industry-wide security standards and preventing insider trading.\nPrior to the regulator's approval, the association had proposed a ban on privacy-centric tokens like Monero on crypto exchanges. It also mulled over the idea of holding government bonds to insure cryptocurrencies.", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 20}

So, unlike other payment systems, Lightning requires \u2018inbound capacity\u2019 in order to receive funds.\u201d\nWhen setting up payment channels, users have to fund their accounts with bitcoin to begin sending and receiving. \u201cInbound capacity\u201d refers to a receiver\u2019s ability to claim a certain number of bitcoin from a sender. If, for example, Molly has a payment channel set up with Angela and Molly funded her side of the channel with 2 BTC while Angela funded her channel with 1 BTC, then Molly\u2019s inbound capacity is 1 BTC and Angela\u2019s is 2 BTC. If Molly wants to receive 2 BTC from Angela then they\u2019d have to open up a new channel and fund it with the appropriate amount.\nIf a sender does not have enough bitcoin for a given transaction, the recipient won\u2019t be able to receive an invoiced amount through the channel. But if a channel is at capacity, then the recipient won\u2019t be able to receive funds, either.\nThis new protocol\u2019s \u201cLoop Out\u201d feature mitigates the latter problem. With Loop Out, a Lightning Network user will be able to empty a channel once it has reached its full capacity. Instead of having to close this channel entirely and set up a new one, they can send a portion of these funds to an on-chain wallet instead.\nThe blog post also noted that this protocol will also make it easier for first-time users to fund their Lightning wallets to begin receiving payments.\n\u201cFurther, when a [user] ... joins the Lightning Network, they can use Loop Out to get initial receiving capacity as well. As a result, new recipients on the network no longer need to rely on others to open channels with them before they\u2019re able to start receiving payments,\u201d Bosworth and Vu wrote.\nLightning Labs is also working on a feature to work in the inverse. Rightly dubbed \u201cLoop In,\u201d this would allow users to refund their payment channels when they become low on bitcoin capacity.\n\u201cThe vision for Lightning Loop is to allow users to securely move funds in and out of the Lightning Network using non-custodial Bitcoin contracts,\u201d per the blog post. \u201cWith Loop, users, businesses, and routing node operators are able to keep Lightning channels open indefinitely, making the network more efficient, more stable, and cheaper to use.\u201d\nTo try Lightning Loop\u2019s alpha release, check out Lightning Lab\u2019s GitHub. While still in the testing phase, Lighting Labs\u2019 blog post emphasized that \u201cLoop Out transactions are limited to a maximum of 0.01 BTC\u201d and will require no additional fees beyond on-chain transaction fees.", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 21}

To achieve this, it has implemented certain safeguards that will keep the operations of crypto businesses away from the traditional financial sector.\nA report by local news outlet El Siglo de Torre\u00f3n clarified that any business looking to submit their application for a permit online will need to do so with a digital certificate, which helps provide confidentiality.\nFor those who don\u2019t have these certificates, the filing will have to be mailed to the Gerencia de Operaci\u00f3n y Continuidad de Negocio de los Sistemas de Pagos, Banxico\u2019s payment systems division.\nApplication for this permit has been open since September 2018, although companies might now have to wait until March 2020 before the new law will come into effect.\nA Regulatory Roadblock\nThe central bank has also prohibited any regulated financial institution from transacting with crypto-related businesses.\nIn an op-ed published by advocacy group Coin Center, written by Executive Director Jerry Brito and Research Director Peter Van Valkenburgh, the authors noted that the actions of Banxico are draconian, effectively putting the local crypto market to the sword.\nThe post states:\n\u201cCryptocurrency exchanges dealing in fiat currency need access to the local banking system. Under the new law, that access will be severely impeded. While the central bank can claim that they are not \u2018banning\u2019 exchanges, the effect will be the same.\u201d\nThe authors of the post also attacked the central bank for taking advantage of a recently passed fintech legislation to crack down on crypto exchanges in Mexico.\n\u201cAs originally envisioned, the new fintech law should have opened Mexico for innovation by not only allowing cryptocurrency exchanges to continue operating but also to provide them a reasonable path to better regulation as full-fledged financial institutions. The central bank, however, has now proposed to do the opposite, closing the door on these promising new technologies by prohibiting any regulated financial institution from offering cryptocurrency exchange, transmission, or custody services to customers.\u201d\nSome of the arguments offered by Banxico for its proposed law include the volatility and complexity of cryptocurrencies, as well as their propensity to be used for illegal purposes.\nHowever, Brito and Van Valkenburgh faulted the premise, claiming that those same properties are inherent in concepts like the internet and cars. Still, that hasn\u2019t stopped people from using them.\nThey concluded the op-ed by calling for support as they look to fight against the regulations, which have now officially entered a consideration period.\nIt is clear why Banxico would resort to establishing regulatory measures on its native crypto market. While the crypto industry shows potential for ushering in a radical change to the way that transactions are conducted worldwide, there has also been a global awakening to the risks that these assets have to investors and traders.\nOther jurisdictions, like Japan, have made similar moves, with the sole purpose of establishing a regulatory framework for crypto-based firms to operate and thrive.\nLimiting the Growth of Crypto\nHowever, according to a report from Mexican news outlet El Economista, the reforms proposed by Banxico could end up destroying the growth prospects of the Mexican crypto market, while creating further division between the country\u2019s crypto industry and its traditional financial sector.\nThe piece argued that, should Banxico get its way, the reforms would \u201climit the use of cryptocurrencies to internal use only for banks and regulated FinTech companies,\u201d leaving crypto-based firms with no option but to operate outside of the law\u2019s scope.\nThe outlet quoted Rocio Robles, managing director at the National Banking and Securities Commission, who explained that the new laws could make various trading operations much more difficult. Robles pointed out that while the rules won\u2019t necessarily halt the growth of the country\u2019s crypto industry, its implementation would create many obstacles to its development.\nHe said that with these laws in place, digital assets \u201ccould continue to make progress in Mexico, but they will involve a lot more hard work.\u201d", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 22}

I listened to the entire audio of the panel discussion, after Programming Bitcoin author Jimmy Song tweeted it out the other day, and I thought he did an awesome job of pointing out the key value proposition of Bitcoin and why it is not worth comparing to permissioned systems.\nWhat Was the Innovation With Bitcoin?\nAs Song covered in his remarks during the panel, the key innovation with Bitcoin was the use of proof of work to enable anonymous actors to take care of the ordering of transactions in a digital financial system. While other digital cash systems were tried in the past, no one was able to come up with the perfect system that could solve issues related to centralization and Sybil attacks.\nWith Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto hit the sweet spot.\nI recently wrote about this same topic in the context of alternative cryptocurrencies that really shouldn\u2019t be referred to as \u201ccryptocurrencies.\u201d Specifically, something like Ripple (XRP) is not comparable to Bitcoin because the system does not use anonymous validators.\nSong hit on this same point while providing his definition of centralized versus decentralized systems.\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I mean: it\u2019s centralized if there\u2019s a single point of failure,\u201d said Song. \u201cAnd I say that because that is exactly how governments control things.\u201d\nBitcoin\u2019s resistance to censorship, shutdown or regulation by governments is its key innovation. This was nothing more than a cypherpunk dream for decades, but Bitcoin turned it into a reality.\n\nSilk Road isn't the \"troubled past\" or \"wild west\". Silk Road is the point. #Bitcoin\u2014 Kyle Torpey (@kyletorpey) October 7, 2014\n\n\nIBM\u2019s Christopher Ferris, who took the side of permissioned blockchains in the debate, even asked Song if he was arguing for anarchy over a regulated financial system during the panel discussion.\nYes! That\u2019s the whole point!\n\u201cI keep my own keys. I have my own bitcoin. That means real self sovereignty,\u201d said Song during one portion of the debate. \u201cThat means real decentralization. I personally like self sovereignty, and I like controlling my own keys, controlling my own money, being my own bank, instead of somebody being able to say, \u2018That\u2019s not yours anymore because we don\u2019t like you and we think you\u2019re a political enemy.\u2019\u201d\nIt is the lack of centralization in Bitcoin that enables permissionless innovation on top of the base blockchain layer. Whether it\u2019s darknet markets allowing for censorship-resistant ecommerce, Abra building a permissionless banking standard, crazy ideas like Bitcoin Hivemind or simply enabling greater levels of financial privacy in a digital age, these sorts of applications are simply not possible with the traditional banking system, which includes the entire permissioned blockchain ecosystem.\nThis Solution Is Not Perfect, but It\u2019s the Best We\u2019ve Got\nIt should be noted that, as Ferris pointed out during the debate, there are still plenty of issues with Bitcoin from a usability perspective. Many people simply aren\u2019t comfortable with the risks associated with this new financial system.\nIssues like bitcoin\u2019s price volatility, the responsibility of taking care of one\u2019s own private keys, the relatively higher costs that come with decentralization and the lack of user-friendly wallets are some of the problems that are still being worked on 10 years after the network was originally launched.\nHowever, it should be noted that these issues aren\u2019t as important to those who put self sovereignty over everything else. This is what many Bitcoin skeptics do not seem to understand. There are plenty of people who are willing to take on the additional risks of using Bitcoin simply because they wish to be in full control of their own finances and also want to support the ability for anyone else in the world to gain this level of extreme financial freedom.\nNew solutions to the various usability issues with Bitcoin are also coming online on a regular basis.\nComparing Bitcoin to traditional banks or permissioned blockchains doesn\u2019t make any sense. Bitcoin is something completely different that was created for a specific purpose: financial self sovereignty.\nThis is a guest post by Kyle Torpey.

Now, one enterprising bitcoiner has used this platform to beam the U.K.\u2019s proposed Brexit deal into space.\nThe application allows users to beam data into space, which can be downloaded by anyone with the appropriate receiver. Users can pay for the service using the Lightning Network.\nIn a post published on crypto review platform How to Buy Crypto, crypto researcher Richard Gargan provided a description of his experience with Blockstream\u2019s satellite application and how he used it to beam the full text of British Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s proposed EU withdrawal agreement into space. He followed the manual process (detailed here) of transmitting data to the blockchain.\nIn the post, Gargan explained that he first converted May\u2019s proposed agreement into a .txt file. From there, he split the file (which had a size of roughly 820 kb) into 82 separate pieces of 10 kb each. (He had to divide the file this way because the satellite\u2019s transmission limit is 10 kb.)\nGargan then uploaded the files one at a time. He reported having to pay 0.00000604800 BTC for a single file \u2014 the fees for sending the file plus an additional fee for using the Lightning Network.\nGargan ended up spending a total of 0.000495936 BTC (worth about \u00a31.49 or $1.96) to transmit the full document to the blockchain. Long story short, Theresa May's Brexit Withdrawal Agreement is now in space and since it's not encrypted, anyone with the right equipment or setup can download it. It took him 1.5 hours to upload the whole document.\nHis method, while simple and straightforward enough, shows that there\u2019s still a fairly constrained limitation on file sizes that Blockstream could improve on.\n\"It was a very laborious and tedious process, as clearly it\u2019s designed to send short messages,\" Gargan told Bitcoin Magazine via email.\nGargan reached out to Blockstream through Internet Relay Chat to inquire about the reasoning behind the 10 kb file size limit. Blockstream responded that the file size is \"currently limited so that other transmissions do not become backlogged.\"\nBlockstream CEO Adam Back told Bitcoin Magazine that the current file size limit exists because \u201cthe current implementation is serialised and only streams one message at a time, so in order to provide [a] timely message service to many users, we currently implement that with a message limit. (Otherwise one person could pay to send a very large message and then other users would not be able to send for some time.)\u201d\nThe team at Blockstream has reason to believe that there may be some backlog on its service.\n\u201cWe have received quite a bit of interest in using the satellite APIs for various application and Bitcoin-related use cases,\u201d Back added. \u201cWe plan to increase the available bandwidth based on demand by reinvesting the revenue to provide faster service.\u201d\nWhile this use case is revolutionary for the industry, it demonstrates an area in which more work could be done, particularly in the process of encoding data and breaking it into smaller chunks before transmitting it. This process will invariably make it difficult to send content that loses its quality when broken into smaller chunks.\nBack said that Blockstream is continuing to improve the flexibility of its satellite data APIs and is expecting to have more flexible stream capability in future upgrades.\n\u201cIt would also be possible with the existing satellite messaging API for application programmers to make a utility to fragment and reassemble [the content], or even stream low- to medium-bandwidth content,\u201d he said.\nPart of the motivation behind Blockstream's satellite service was to provide a means of reducing the Bitcoin network\u2019s dependency on conventional internet connectivity. It works by allowing users to broadcast data all over the world via the Bitcoin network, while ensuring security and accessibility.\nBlockstream launched its satellite service in 2017 with a focus on transmitting messages to receivers in Europe, Africa and the Americas. It later expanded to Asia and added support for Lightning payments.", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 22}

Last year saw the entry of a new breed of cyber extortionists that seems to be gaining ground, so much so that they were able to steal over $300,000 in bitcoin (BTC) tokens in 2018.\nAccording to a report by research and risk assessment firm Digital Shadows, this scam was committed through a wide array of \u201csextortion\u201d blackmail strategies, which included the weaponization of emails.\nThe report, which was titled \u201cA Tale of Epic Extortions: How Cybercriminals Monetize Our Online Exposure,\u201d revealed that the scam started back in 2017. However, it only gained mainstream notoriety in the middle of 2018, after its list of victims continued to grow.\nDigital Shadows was able to track over 792,000 targeted emails, where it discovered the loss of about $300,000 worth of bitcoin, which was stolen from over 3,000 bitcoin wallet addresses.\nHow They Operate\nThe goal of the cybercriminals is to convince the victim that their system had been hacked, allowing them to obtain valuable information that could expose their intimate activities.\nTo look convincing, the extortionists provide the victim with a known password, also known as \u201cproof\u201d of compromise \u2014 this is meant to offer evidence of the hack. Then they claim to have footage of the victim watching porn online, urging them to pay a ransom in bitcoin or risk exposure.\nAs with most email scams, the composition of the emails is often a problem. Per the report from Digital Shadows, the construction of the email could make the difference between one that gets past a spam filter and the one that doesn't. Some sophisticated criminals go to great lengths to distribute emails at scale by using freshly minted outlook.com addresses.\n\u201cAcross the emails we collected, there was a variation in the capabilities displayed by the attackers. Certain spammers showed little understanding of how to craft and distribute emails on scale, sending malformed emails that would never make it past a mail server or spam filter,\u201d the report reads.\nBased on the examination of their IP addresses, the firm noted that the scam wasn\u2019t localized to a single region. Scammers operated across a wide array of locations, with the highest percentage of the emails being sent from a position in Vietnam (amounting to 8.5 percent of the total emails sent); 5.3 percent of the emails were sent from somewhere in Brazil and India came third with 4.7 percent of the total email count.\nTargeting Married and \u201cHigh Net Worth\u201d Individuals\nThe cybercriminals targeted individuals with high net worth, as they believe these groups could easily pay the ransom without \u201cdragging the process for too long.\u201d\nThe scammers also targeted married individuals. The criminals often use marriage as extra leverage over the victims, providing an additional incentive to convince the victim to make the payment.\nOnline Crowdfunding Campaigns\nThe Dark Overlord (TDO), a prominent extortionist group which, after a brief break, returned in 2018 with a new modus operandi, was featured in the report.\nThe criminal group changed its model from extorting victims directly to selling \u201cstolen data in batches to other users on criminal forums, and adopted an altogether more unusual tactic: online crowdfunding campaigns.\u201d Using online crowdfunding campaigns, extortionist groups like TDO can raise the ransom the victim would have paid from members of the public desperate to unlock the troves of data in their possession.\nThe extortionist group reportedly started its career selling data on TheRealDeal, a forum on the dark web. When the forum folded, they went on a spree of extortions, including directly contacting their victims and threatening to expose their private information if their demands weren\u2019t met.\nTDO kept providing regular updates of their operations via their Twitter page. The group went back to the dark web in September 2018, recruiting extra accomplices and selling their acquired data on KickAss, another criminal forum. They set up The Dark Overlord Sales, a subsection of KickAss, to sell their data to other parties on the platform.\nThe cybercriminals victims included insurance provider Hiscox, which lost over 10GB of sensitive data related to the 9/11 bombings to the group. Their operation pattern shows the effectiveness of using crowdfunding platforms to gain more publicity online, while also generating sustainable revenue.", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 1}

We are currently experiencing a potential retest of the symmetrical triangle breakout. If the retest holds, this could mean we\u2019re in for a decent leg up in price, as the price target for this symmetrical triangle is a near $1,000 move (a 30% markup):\n\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Symmetrical Triangle Retest\nTo calculate the typical breakout target for a symmetrical triangle, we simply take the height of the base and project it to the point of breakout. In our case, it\u2019s around $1,000 (technically, it\u2019s about $1,100, but I\u2019m being conservative since we are in a bear market).\nKeep in mind that this just a setup, and our current failure to establish new highs could mean we need to push lower, test macro support and THEN retest the resistance overhead. However, if this level holds, the implications are fairly bullish.\nIn the event we continue upward, keep a close eye out for a close above our current $4,200 high. If we manage to close a new high, that will likely spark fresh buying interest since it would ultimately yield a break of our current bearish structure. Conversely, our failure to hold our current level would likely mean a return to the low $3,000s to test macro support.\nSummary:\nOur current rejection of the low $4,000s coincided with a retest of local support and a retest of our symmetrical triangle consolidation.If we manage to hold support, we could be looking at a $1,000 move to the upside into the upper $4,000 area.If we fail to hold support, we will likely see a retest of the $3,000 range to test the demand along macro support.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Promising to involve several of the nation\u2019s law enforcement agencies, Cryptopia\u2019s announcement also stated that all of the exchange\u2019s functionality and trading services would be suspended until further notice.\nThe exchange, as well as Cryptopia\u2019s website, are still down in late February. Users have been left largely in the dark as to any updates on the site\u2019s functionality or Cryptopia\u2019s plans to deal with the fallout of this hack.\nOn February 26, 2019, the exchange\u2019s Twitter account began posting several updates to the situation. First, they claimed to have calculated a worst-case scenario for January\u2019s hack: up to 9.4 percent of all holdings in the exchange.

The bill was proposed by Assemblymember Phil Ting on February 20, 2019.\nIf put into law, it would affect California's many cannabis businesses.\nLogistical Barriers: Delivering Bags of Cash\nOne of the most prominent driving factors behind this bill, and where the decentralized nature of financial blockchain technology really has a chance to shine, is the fact that banks lack cooperation with these businesses. Citing a conflict with federal law, many financial institutions refuse to let cannabis businesses open bank accounts, thereby cutting off this multibillion-dollar industry from using digital money transfers.\n\u201cThe current recommendation from the state of California to cannabis businesses is that they use armored vehicles to pay their taxes,\u201d said Alexandra Medina of the BAC. \u201cThat\u2019s inefficient and risky. It\u2019s closer to how one might pay taxes during the gold rush, with a stage coach and gunman, than how you would expect California to accept taxes in 2019.\u201d\nThis current approach is a logistical \u201cnightmare for cities, the state and businesses,\u201d she claimed. It\u2019s dangerous to money couriers, and it forces revenue agencies \u201cto count tens of thousands of bills,\u201d causing tax offices to \u201csmell like weed and fabric softener.\u201d\nSo far, there has been little progress made to alleviate the situation. \u201cThe previous state treasurer convened a working group to solve this issue, and a year later their report did not have a solution,\u201d said Medina. The physical cash transport is \u201ca problem the state has tried and failed to solve.\u201d\nOpportunities for Blockchain and Open Finance\nMedina called the new bill \u201ca great use case for blockchain and open finance.\u201d To this end, the Blockchain Advocacy Coalition will help educate policymakers about the basics of digital currency and blockchain technology in the hopes of getting the bill passed.\nThe group has already hosted roundtables for the state\u2019s new treasurer, Fiona Ma, and Governor Gavin Newsom. \u201cThey are both very tech savvy and innovative leaders for our state,\u201d said Medina. \u201cNow is a really good time to introduce something like this.\u201d\nIn the grander scheme, Medina believes that \u201cCalifornia has the opportunity to turn around a lack of regulatory clarity\u201d and serve as an example for other states in the Union.\nGetting the Bill Passed\nAt present, getting the bill passed is the group\u2019s main concern. The bill recommends using a stablecoin for these tax payments, but in its current form it will not be prescribing a specific stablecoin. For now, according to Medina, the bill\u2019s supporters will \u201cwork to create standards for what kind of coins and wallets the state uses to make sure we have the highest degree of stability and safety for both the state and businesses.\u201d\nMedina claimed that the group has already supported two bills that were signed into law in the last year. This new bill will start going through the assembly committee(s) in March and April and has until the end of May to pass the Assembly. Then it will repeat the process with the Senate; it has to get through committee and through the Senate floor by September 13, 2019. If all of these processes go smoothly, and the governor signs it into law by October 13, 2019, Medina expects the bill to be implemented by June 2020.\nMedina said that in the BAC\u2019s previous campaigns, over 50 businesses signed support letters for their initiatives, and the group \u201cwould like an even stronger showing this year.\u201d\nShe added that the group has plans to organize \u201ca blockchain education day, where industry advocates can meet with legislators 1:1 and answer questions about the technology and bill,\u201d before the vote reaches the Senate.", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 28}

Additionally, in November 2018, PureBit posted an apology notice on its website after stealing $2.8 million in a fairly straightforward exit scam.\nEven when exchanges attempt to conduct operations in good faith, they still are often victimized by hacker attacks. In June 2018 alone, for example, exchanges Bithumb and Coinrail lost $30 million and $40 million dollars respectively due to hackers.\nThese staggering figures still pale in comparison, however, to the exploits of North Korea.

But the company in question, specifically the ties it has to the unethical practices of one of its predecessors, suggests that the monolithic Coinbase may be joining the oligarchic ranks of its privacy-hostile, too-big-for-consumer-comfort counterparts in legacy tech.\nThe Ties That Damn\nOn its website, Italian blockchain analysis company Neutrino proudly advertises that its proprietary software offers all-in-one \u201csolutions for law enforcement\u201d and \u201cfinancial services.\u201d Its two flagships, XFlow nSpect and XFlow nSight, are billed as \u201ccomprehensive solution[s] for monitoring[,] analyzing and tracking cryptocurrency flows across multiple blockchains.\u201d nSight was built to help exchanges and financial service companies like Coinbase to stay regulatorily compliant. nSpect, on the other hand, was built for \u201ccriminal investigations and intelligence gathering\u201d and is specifically marketed toward law enforcement.\nContinuing on with their work at Coinbase, the Neutrino team, a three-man show consisting of CEO Giancarlo Russo, CRO Marco Valleri and CTO Alberto Ornaghi, are no strangers to building complex computer monitoring software for law agencies.\nIn another life, they did it as Hacking Team, the notorious Italian software services firm whose dubious business practices made them an antagonist of the wider tech and privacy community. Hacking Team got their start when Valleri and Ornaghi (under the aliases NaGa and ALoR) sold man-in-the-middle attack software to the police force of Milan, Italy, in 2003. These two founders would later be joined by Russo, who acted as COO of the company.\nThroughout its history, Hacking Team sold its services to oppressive regimes in Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Sudan, Kazakhstan, Bahrain and Turkey, among others. These services centered around Hacking Team\u2019s proprietary Remote Control System (RCS) software, a Trojan horse malware that gives users the ability to remotely access files, record keystrokes, take photos and read emails from any infected device.\nEmail leaks reported by The Intercept trace the team\u2019s cyber footprints to human rights abuses around the world. Hacking Team\u2019s RCS technology was used by the Ethiopian government (which ranks as one of the most oppressive in Africa, with a penchant for silencing free speech) to surveil and interfere with the operations of Ethiopian Satellite Television and Radio, a news outlet run by Ethiopian expats. The technology helped the Turkish government to spy on an American, and it was also sold to the Sudanese National Intelligence and Security Service in 2012 for a whopping \u20ac960,000 (around $1,210,000 at the time), though the team shuttered Sudan\u2019s access to their software in 2014 when the government\u2019s clumsy implementation of the software showed that they weren\u2019t \u201cenough prepared for the product usage,\u201d Hacking Team emails reveal. It also played its part in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia and the assault and arrest of UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor.\nReporters Without Borders labeled Hacking Team as one of five \u201cEnemies of the Internet\u201d in 2013 for its role in humanitarian abuses against journalists.\nDuring the 2012 uprisings in Morocco that were inspired by the Arab Spring movement, RCS, under the control of the Moroccan government, singled out Mamfakinch.com, an outlet that published journalists who were vocal critics of the regime. The leaked emails prove that Hacking Team had been selling its software to Morocco since 2010. This would culminate in Mamfakinch\u2019s hardware being infected by a Trojan horse virus, which originally masqueraded as a news tip.\n\u201cMamfakinch.com came as the first citizen media portal to document protests, providing tools like mapping of protests and also articles. At the time it started, I was not a member. I was asked to join later by one of the co-founders,\u201d Zineb, a pro-democracy activist who was involved with Mamfakinch, told Bitcoin Magazine.\nThe outlet employed the help of the Citizen Lab to dismantle the virus and trace it back to its Hacking Team source, though most of the damage had already been done by the time they consulted this help.\n\u201cMoroccan activists suffer tremendously from what government surveillance provides them with, and former ones like myself have seen what that can be like. From physical threats to family threats, and even worse threats to fellow activists who were part of the human rights and digital rights effort in Morocco,\u201d she said.\nHacking Team repeatedly refused to disclose its clients, and the internal emails betray that, more often than not, when their ties to human rights abuses and oppressive regimes were unearthed by international media, they always tried to mitigate the scrutiny and severity of the ensuing bad press.\nIn June of 2014, a U.N. panel inquired into Hacking Team\u2019s business with Sudan for violating sanctions regarding weapons exports to the country. The U.N. considered Hacking Team\u2019s software a weapon of sorts, something that Russo refutes in internal emails while also emphasizing that the team wants to keep its name clear from any records regarding the investigation.\n\u201cIt looks like their focus is to trace every single armament,\u201d wrote Russo. \u201cWe absolutely need to avoid being mentioned in these documents.\u201d\nWhy Coinbase (and We) Should Care\nThe U.N. investigative panel would mark the beginning of Hacking Team\u2019s unraveling. By March 2016, the Italian government revoked Hacking Team\u2019s export license after an Italian PhD student was murdered in Cairo, Egypt. Hacking Team\u2019s software was allegedly involved in the crime. With the company\u2019s revenue streams severely restricted, Hacking Team was on its last financial leg.\nConveniently, Neutrino was founded the same year that Italian officials revoked Hacking Team\u2019s export license, \u201cvery obviously around the time that they would have been desperate for money and needing to start fresh somehow,\u201d Janine, a member of crypto podcast Block Digest who initially raised the alarm about Hacking Team and Neutrino\u2019s ties, told Bitcoin Magazine.\nBitcoin Magazine spoke to Janine to learn more about the possible ramifications of this acquisition. In addition to her work at Block Digest, Janine has been a consistent and reliable whistleblower for industry developments that could indicate privacy threats. In the past, she also helped dissect community concerns surrounding the privacy implications of Bitfury\u2019s Peach Lightning suite.\nAs with the Bitfury situation, Janine has covered every angle of Neutrino and Hacking Team\u2019s shared past on Twitter, and she helped Block Digest produce a two-hour segment on the subject, as well.\n\nHacking Team has been listed as an \"Enemy of the Internet\" by @RSF_inter because they \"sell products that are used by authoritarian governments to commit violations of human rights and freedom of information.\" https://t.co/9xDnfJotYo\u2014 Janine (@J9Roem) February 20, 2019\n\n\nSince Neutrino was acquired by Coinbase, the team is more than financially secure. Furthermore, as part of the deal, it will continue to act autonomously out of Coinbase\u2019s London office. The exchange framed the buyout as a means to outfit itself with the proper tools to remain KYC- and AML-compliant with regulators. Janine points out that the company will likely make use of XFlow nSight to this end, though she\u2019s also worried that Neutrino\u2019s technology will come with more serious privacy trade-offs than nSight\u2019s base functionality.\n\u201cThe chain analysis stuff is not really that interesting to me; it is how much access Coinbase will give to Neutrino,\u201d she told Bitcoin Magazine.\nMore specifically, she expressed concern about Money Module, a Hacking Team software that allows the user to access devices and private keys. Janine is also suspicious of the backdoors that Hacking Team coded into their software: \u201cThey likely had access to whatever data these government clients were collecting from their targets.\u201d\nIf Coinbase forks over too much data to Neutrino for transaction analysis, and if a backdoor to the software exists in tandem with Money Module, this could spell disaster for user privacy and private key security.\nThat this backdoor may exist alongside a vehicle for stealing user funds is disturbing \u2014 even more disturbing, Janine and other critics have suggested, is Coinbase\u2019s ability to overlook the history of unethical business practices of Neutrino\u2019s team.\nWhen Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Coinbase to ask about the acquisition and how it plans to use Neutrino, the exchange sent back a general statement, indicating that they are aware of and don\u2019t condone Hacking Team\u2019s practices. But this past behavior is not enough for Coinbase to distance themselves from a team whose expertise is in line with its vision:\nWe are aware that Neutrino\u2019s co-founders previously worked at Hacking Team, which we reviewed as part of our security, technical and hiring diligence. Coinbase does not condone nor will it defend the actions of Hacking Team. Increasingly, third-party blockchain analysis companies are requesting customer data from cryptocurrency companies that they serve. It was important for Coinbase to bring this function in-house to fully control and protect our customers\u2019 data and Neutrino\u2019s technology was the best we encountered in the space to achieve this goal.\nZineb, who is also a crypto enthusiast, told us that it\u2019s disheartening to see the same privacy-compromising and autocratic software eke its way into the cryptocurrency space. You expect this from the legacy tech industry, she expressed, but you don\u2019t expect it in an industry whose tenets rest on privacy, freedom and censorship resistance.\n\u201cTo have Coinbase acquire anything run by anyone ever associated with Hacking Team is alarming,\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps Coinbase is clueless as to WHY it\u2019s important to protect [these virtues], but I\u2019m not. When banks freeze or easily hand over private financial information of dissidents in autocratic countries, that\u2019s when a system like [Bitcoin] is needed.\n\u201cThey say this is to protect user data. But how can they possibly trust that those who engaged in such appalling actions would somehow have Coinbase user data privacy\u2019s best interest at heart? I can\u2019t say much for others but I can only speak for myself: I won\u2019t be using any of their tools in the future, and shame on them for allowing the Hacking Team people to continue to thrive.\"", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 28}

Using the updated functionality of Payment Requests, users will be able to generate URLs that allow people to request payments and produce documentation of the transactions, eliminating many of the inconveniences of most peer-to-peer bitcoin interactions.\nPayment processors have become integral to the crypto sphere, with several different models available. Tippin.me, for instance, relies on the Lightning network to let users receive tips via a QR code, or even, still in development, over other apps. Bitwage also opened a marketplace this February, allowing freelancers to create bank accounts that will accept crypto assets as payment from a variety of sources. BitPay, another payment processor, has set record revenue numbers for the past two years, as well.\nAll of these processors, however, are centralized for convenience. BTCPay Server, a decentralized option which was forked from BitPay\u2019s software, wants to make crypto payment processing decentralized, and its new service, the initiative claims, will make this even easier.\nPayment Requests will allow users to directly request amounts of money from the wallets of other users, keeping with BTCPay\u2019s existing standard of refusing to involve third-party custodians or additional fees. Usually, third parties are typically involved in these transactions because of a large variety of inconveniences associated with peer-to-peer transactions: e.g., having to update addresses for privacy reasons, staying on top of fluctuating exchange rates and the lack of any formal invoice used for record keeping.\nIdeally, BTCPay\u2019s new form of payment will make using a decentralized service as easy as following a URL created for each transaction, providing many of the features of a third-party payment processor but without either taking a cut or mandating that funds be stored in a wallet owned by the processor in question.\nThe news is the latest in a steady period of growth for the BTCPay.

However, I do believe that the crypto community is misguided in its belief that decentralization is an end-all be-all solution to the ills of centralization as we know it. Yes, decentralization can help eliminate some of the inherent problems of centralized infrastructure, but is decentralization necessarily our objective? In the pursuit of mass adoption, decentralization shouldn\u2019t be our goal, but instead a means to achieve the many different, and equally important, goals that exist for cryptocurrency users.\nIn the pursuit of mass adoption, decentralization shouldn\u2019t be our goal, but instead a means to achieve the many different, and equally important, goals that exist for cryptocurrency users.\nWhen I first fell down the Bitcoin rabbit hole five years ago, I too thought decentralization was the \u201choly grail\u201d for the success of the industry. I recognized (and still do) the fundamental problems with centralization and shared in the idealistic vision of keeping cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether decentralized amidst rapid advancements in the industry.\nIn time, however, I came to realize that decentralization is a broad concept that can be costly, difficult to implement, and, most of all, hard to define. Because each person enters the community with their own definition for \u201cdecentralization,\u201d they\u2019re far more likely to prematurely reject projects that don\u2019t meet their vision. In many ways, this conflict has served as the catalyst driving many coins, and their respective communities, to hard fork from one another.\nIn searching for a solution, I posit that developers and investors alike must be willing to compromise in order to appeal to a general public that could care less about the word \u201cdecentralization\u201d and more about the words \u201cfast, cheap, convenient, accessible or private.\u201d If your product is too difficult, expensive or inaccessible, your target audience simply won\u2019t use it.\nAs is the case with most things in cryptocurrency, distinctions in decentralization are not always black and white. While one person might define decentralization as each person running their own node, another might define it as having multiple competing development teams working on a given protocol, while yet another person might define it as the distribution of mining power. None of these individuals are wrong by any means, but because they disagree, they are more likely to accuse one another of inherent centralization.\nHerein lies the problem: Because there\u2019s no agreed-upon standard for decentralization, it\u2019s impossible for the cryptocurrency community to come to a consensus about which projects are actually decentralized. It can\u2019t be the goal if there\u2019s no metric for how to successfully achieve it.\nConsider the role of decentralized exchanges (DEXs), for example. While most exchange platforms serve as intermediaries for the efficient trading of cryptocurrency between users, DEXs can take the intermediary out of the equation \u2014 simply connecting the buyer and the seller through a cryptocurrency transaction. There are clear benefits to decentralizing this process:\nEliminating custodial risk by allowing each user to control their funds;Allowing broader access to the exchange from anyone in the world;Allowing broader access to any cryptocurrency asset; andProviding privacy with no Know-Your-Customer (KYC) requirements.\nWhile some of the most decentralized exchanges are able to accomplish all of the above, they must make huge compromises in user experience (UX), speed and cost in order to do so. For example, the most complained-about issue with centralized exchanges is the security risk of centralized funds. But while several DEXs are able to solve issue #1, they still require KYC protocols and limit the types of assets listed on the exchange. As a result, these DEXs are subjected to criticism for \u201cnot being decentralized.\u201d If solving a security issue was their goal, however, then they\u2019ve made huge strides in their achievements and deserve recognition.\nIf we truly expect the industry to grow, crypto projects must be willing to accept a balance of centralization and decentralization in order to achieve the end goals of the community. This doesn\u2019t mean that we have to gather crypto\u2019s brightest minds in one room to formally decide on a definition of the word \u201cdecentralization;\u201d we wouldn\u2019t want them to. It does, however, mean that individuals within the broader blockchain community should stop using their own understanding of decentralization as a litmus test for the success of other projects.\nInstead, investors should step back and ask themselves what their goals were when they got involved in this technology, and then see if the projects they support or work on align with those goals. Once we take a step back and realize that decentralization is actually a blanket term covering many different mindsets and perspectives, we will finally be able to embrace the many diverse projects that have the potential to drive the industry forward.\nOver the years, I\u2019ve spoken to many friends and colleagues on this issue, and I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that 100 percent decentralization doesn\u2019t exist. There is always going to be some degree of compromise required between parties in order to create a fully functioning and scalable project or platform.\nThat being said: Is this necessarily a bad thing? We\u2019re not, at least in the near future, going to see decentralized projects overpower the internet or abolish the federal reserve. However, as cryptocurrency gains momentum with mainstream audiences, we\u2019re more likely to see diversification in the types of platforms (both centralized and decentralized) that are made available to us. It may not look exactly like what we envisioned when we first jumped down the cryptocurrency rabbit hole, but that doesn\u2019t mean it will be any less impactful or important.\nThis is a guest post by Paul Puey.

She gave a presentation to his \u201cEvolution of Finance\u201d class titled \u201cBlockchain and the Future of Finance.\u201d According to Brown, the presentation contained \u201cmultiple misstatements\u201d about Bitcoin and its fundamentals.\nAfter the presentation, Brown was dissatisfied with how Bitcoin was referenced by Athey during the lecture to a room comprised (mostly) of people who were unfamiliar with the fundamental concepts behind the technology. This prompted him to write an email to the Stanford Graduate School of Business Advisory Council, expressing his concerns.\nBrown says that the only response he has received from the university thus far is an email stating, \u201cWe will get back to you on this.\u201d That\u2019s when he posted his complaint on Twitter.\nWhat She Got Wrong\nAthey, who Brown told Bitcoin Magazine is also slated to teach an entire course at Stanford next semester called \u201cCryptocurrencies,\u201d claimed that not only is Bitcoin \"controlled by a small group of miners in China,\" but that it also \u201cwastes electricity by stealing from rivers to solve useless math problems.\u201d Athey also mentioned that bitcoin is \"secured economically and not cryptographically.\"\nIn her presentation degrading the first digital, decentralized currency, Athey drew comparisons to what she considered a better solution in Ripple\u2019s technology, using XRP. Specifically, she cited exchange rate volatility, trust issues with exchanges, and long transaction times as drawbacks to using Bitcoin (stating that, subsequently, exchanges needed to buy bitcoin). Athey then, according to her presentation, explained how Ripple\u2019s XRP, xRapid API, and overall consensus mechanism provide an alternative that is faster, cheaper, more secure, and more energy friendly than Bitcoin.\nIn protest, Brown composed a letter addressed to the Graduate School of Business, expressing his thoughts that certain statements about Bitcoin should have been subject to \u201chigh caliber discussion and peer review.\u201d\nIn addressing Athey\u2019s claims against Bitcoin, Brown properly explained where Athey missed key concepts.\nAddressing her claim on mining centralization by a small group in China, Brown explained that Athey was conflating mining nodes with full nodes and had used this misrepresentation to position Ripple as a better alternative to Bitcoin. He also countered by explaining that miners often compile their resources together in a mining pool, but there are many individual miners in these pools and not one entity can completely control Bitcoin.\nTo Athey\u2019s claim that Bitcoin is secured economically and not cryptographically, Brown pointed out that she is once again conflating two different things: Stealing funds by cracking the encryption of the wallet and using mining power to 51% attack a network.\nConflict of Interest?\nAs the matter came to light on Twitter, it was pointed out that Athey was welcomed to the Ripple Labs Board of Directors back in April 2014, where she still maintains an active role. When Nic Carter asked on Twitter if Athey had made any disclosure before her presentation, she replied directly: \u201cFive minute verbal introduction discussing my background in the space \u2014 no way to miss it!\u201d\nWhether or not Athey had any ill-intent in her presentation, Brown told Bitcoin Magazine that is not what mattered to him.\n\u201cIt concerns me that my classmates\u2019 first introduction to Bitcoin contained severe factual errors along with strong anti-Bitcoin rhetoric. The academy is not a place for marketing, but rigorously testing ideas. If a professor has a potential conflict of interest, they should be held to the highest standards of scrutiny and peer review.\n\u201cThat being said, Bitcoin is a creature of the internet. Its properties are difficult for academics to appreciate due to its deeply interdisciplinary and evolutionary nature. This makes it difficult for developing a curriculum because of the siloed design of academic disciplines and the slow pace of the peer review process. The internet will always be the best place to pursue a Bitcoin education.\u201d", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 1}

This was not an easy decision, but their prior work does present a conflict with our mission. We are thankful to the Neutrino team for engaging with us on this outcome.\u201d\nLast week, Neutrino\u2019s link to Hacking Team came to light thanks to Twitter commentators like Block Digest\u2019s \u201cJanine.\u201d At least three individuals in Neutrino\u2019s core team (CEO Giancarlo Russo, CRO Marco Valleri and CTO Alberto Ornaghi) had been principal employees of Hacking Team, as well as Luca Guerre, an intern-turned-software-engineer at the company.\nCoinbase did not disclose which team members would be let go, so there\u2019s no information to indicate how many other Neutrino employees might be affected by the severance. Armstrong also offered no timeline in his post for when these departures would take place.\nDisbanded in 2016, Hacking Team made headlines during its business\u2019 zenith for selling surveillance malware to authoritarian governments. Their software\u2019s use has been implicated in inumerable privacy and human rights abuses, including the death and imprisonment of journalists and civil rights activists.\nNews of Hacking Team\u2019s abuses spread like wildfire through the community, in part stoked by tenacious media coverage and social media backlash, culminating in a #DeleteCoinbase campaign.\nAnd apparently, this heat was enough for Coinbase to decide to dissolve its connections with the people previously associated with Hacking Team.\nPreviously, the exchange had defended its acquisition in a blanket statement sent to the press. Coinbase stated that it \u201cdoes not condone nor will it defend the actions of Hacking Team,\u201d but that it was \u201cimportant for [it] to bring [blockchain analysis services] in-house to fully control and protect our customers' data, and Neutrino\u2019s technology was the best we encountered in the space to achieve this goal.\u201d\nA few days after this response to the situation, Coinbase\u2019s Director of Institutional Sales, Christine Sandler, would tell Cheddar that the need to bring these services in-house to protect data was due to its former blockchain analysis providers monetizing user data, something that is against Coinbase\u2019s privacy policy.\nIn his post, Armstrong mentions that Neutrino was also acquired because their old providers didn\u2019t support all the assets [the exchange] wanted to have on [its] platform,\u201d so it \u201cexamined the players, found that Neutrino had some of the best technology in this area, and decided to acquire them.\u201d", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 5}
{"title": "Coinbase Bought Neutrino Because Its Old Analysis Providers Sold User Data", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/coinbase-bought-neutrino-because-its-old-analysis-providers-sold-user-data/", "birthday": "Mar 4, 2019  3:56 PM EST", "date": "2019-03-04 20:56:00", "content": "Colin is an associate editor and staff writer for Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0 He's proud to call Nashville his home, where he lives with his family and doesn't eat hot chicken as much as you might think.\u00a0\n\nCoinbase\u2019s Director of Institutional Sales, Christine Sandler, said in an interview last week that, in part, the exchange acquired controversial software firm Neutrino because its prior blockchain analysis providers were selling customer data.\n\u201cThe compelling reason for making the acquisition was that Neutrino had some industry leading, best in class technology. It was important for us to migrate away from our current providers. They were selling client data to outside sources and it was compelling for us to get control over that and have proprietary technology that we could leverage to keep the data safe and protect our clients,\u201d Sandler said in an interview with Cheddar.\nIn its current privacy policy, Coinbase asserts that it only shares customer information with third parties for fraud prevention and legal compliance as well as for \u201cbill collection, marketing, and other technology services.\u201d The same active policy says that they will personally never sell client information, transaction or personal, and nor will these third parties.\n\n\nCoinbase's current privacy policy, effective May 25th 2018: https://t.co/LjLAelGU4N pic.twitter.com/Qo7ZBkOsDX\u2014 Janine (@J9Roem) March 3, 2019\n\n\n\nSandler\u2019s slip up tells another tale. If her statement is true, then Coinbase may have inadvertently violated its terms of use. Coinbase users believed that their data was only being shared for regulatory purpose, not being monetized, as Jill Carlson points out on Twitter:\n\u201cSelling data is very different from collecting it for regulatory purposes. I consented to Coinbase collecting my data for KYC/AML purposes. I did not knowingly consent to Coinbase collecting my data to sell to other parties.\u201d\nSeeing as their prior providers breached this trust, Coinbase\u2019s acquisition of Neutrino makes sense; out with the old and in with the (hopefully more trustworthy) new. In one of its news blurbs, cryptocurrency media platform Messari indicates that the purchase was likely made to minimize counterpart risk by bringing analysis services in house. Most all other exchanges use the same providers, a source told Messari, so going with the new kid on the block was likely the only way Coinbase could make sure the provider would do as they\u2019re told.\n\u201cA source with knowledge of the situation explained there wasn't much of a choice for Coinbase, as almost all regulated crypto exchanges likely use one of several large blockchain analytics tools, including those from industry leaders Elliptic and Chainalysis. The source said that those firms had moved to a \u2018give-get\u2019 data model, where Coinbase would only have been permitted to use the service in return for providing its own data. Coinbase \u2018brought that capability in house so they weren\u2019t in a situation where using a 3rd party tool was making it better\u2019 as a surveillance tech.\u201d\nStill, if Coinbase was looking for a team it could trust, Neutrino\u2019s past is far from trustworthy. The company\u2019s three executives used to run a business called Hacking Team, which sold surveillance malware to authoritarian regimes around the world which precipitated, among other human rights abuses, the monitoring, imprisonment and death of journalists and regime dissidents.\nNeutrino\u2019s past has it and Coinbase embroiled in intense community scrutiny, and the collective ire has manifested in a #DeleteCoinbase campaign on Twitter.\nCoinbase claims that Neutrino offer best-in-class software, hence why they\u2019re the best fit for AML/KYC compliance and other business-related transaction analysis. But even disregarding the questions of trust that Neutrino\u2019s past may muster, the company\u2019s pedigree might not even be all that up-to-snuff.\nJesse Powell, CEO of Kraken exchange, said that Neutrino was disqualified \u201cdue [to its] risks\u201d in a compliance evaluation. Even without this risk, they came in last for actual product when compared to four other providers.\n\u201cI asked our Compliance team what they thought of Neutrino,\u201d Powell tweeted. \u201cFortunately, they'd just completed an evaluation. Neutrino came in last place on product (out of the 5) but was disqualified anyway due to the risks. However, other factors are important in M&A: cost, culture fit.\u201d\nBHB Network head Giacomo Zucco told Bitcoin Magazine that his company gave a negative evaluation of Neutrino\u2019s services for similar reasons that Kraken\u2019s compliance review raised red flags. Zucco told Bitcoin Magazine that, when BHB Network evaluated a live demo of Neutrino\u2019s blockchain analysis technology for a client in February 2017, the company refused to let BHB test the tech using their own addresses.\nThe demo was conducted using \u201cpre-defined addresses,\u201d he said, and the team argued that they couldn\u2019t open source the software because the technology had its own \u201csecret\u201d algorithm that they couldn\u2019t give away.\n\u201cWe didn't actually get so far. After the demo, I had some doubts about the \u2018secret source\u2019 claims. Then we googled names and that was enough for me to tell my client to pass,\u201d Zucco told Bitcoin Magazine.\nAt the time of publication, Coinbase had not returned Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s request for comment.", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 4}
{"title": "As Court Reconvenes for QuadrigaCX, Questions Surround Empty Cold Wallets", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/court-reconvenes-quadrigacx-questions-surround-empty-cold-wallets/", "birthday": "Mar 5, 2019  12:17 PM EST", "date": "2019-03-05 17:17:00", "content": "Colin is an associate editor and staff writer for Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0 He's proud to call Nashville his home, where he lives with his family and doesn't eat hot chicken as much as you might think.\u00a0\n\nUpdate: After the March 5, 2019 court hearing, Justice Wood has granted QuadrigaCX a 45-day stay on proceedings. He has also appointed Peter Wedlake, a Grant Thornton lawyer who is part of QuadrigaCX\u2019s counsel, as the company\u2019s Chief Restructuring Officer, though the judge was reluctant at first to approve the position out of cost and efficiency concerns. The court will reconvene for the next round of proceedings on April 18, 2019, while the stay extends QuadrigaCX creditor protections until April 23, 2019. Source.\nAs QuadrigaCX\u2019s legal counsel descends on the courtroom in Halifax, Nova Scotia, for another round of legal proceedings, the court monitor\u2019s third report on QuadrigaCX\u2019s finances \u2014 specifically its revelation that the exchange\u2019s cold wallets are empty \u2014 lays out some hopeful avenues for fund recovery \u2014 and some frustrating dead ends.\nQuandrigaCX has been entrenched in a solvency scandal ever since its founder\u2019s untimely death on December 8, 2018. Gerald Cotten passed away while honeymooning with his wife, Jennifer Robertson, in Jaipur, India. According to his widow and his company, he died with the sole knowledge of the exchange\u2019s cold storage private keys and seed phrases. The exchange filed for creditor protection on February 5, 2019.\nErnst & Young (EY) was appointed as monitor over the case, and it\u2019s now saying that the long sought-after funds in QuadrigaCX\u2019s elusive cold wallets aren\u2019t there. The wallets are empty and have been for almost a year, the accounting firm writes in its third report for the Nova Scotia court. It also reports that it has secured some $25 million CAD in customer funds from QuadrigaCX\u2019s payment processing partners. Additionally, it reveals that QuadrigaCX opened 14 accounts on its own platform under various aliases, while it also held accounts (and possibly funds) on four other exchanges.\nAnd if that weren\u2019t enough to chew on going into today\u2019s hearing, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell told Fortune and Forbes that he has been contacted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and FBI about the situation.\nCold Wallets Give the Cold Shoulder\nThe most salient (if disheartening) finding in EY\u2019s third report is the apparent emptiness of QuadrigaCX\u2019s cold storage. More salient still is how long they\u2019ve been empty.\nUpon review by the monitor, the following addresses have been identified as QuadrigaCX\u2019s former cold storage:\n1MhgmGaHwLAvvKVyFvy6zy9pRQFXaxwE9M\n1JPtxSGoekZfLQeYAWkbhBhkr2VEDADHZB\n1ECUQLuioJbFZAQchcZq9pggd4EwcpuANe\n1J9Fqc3TicNoy1Y7tgmhQznWrP5AVLXj9R\n1HyYMMCdCcHnfjwMW2jE4cv9qVkVDFUzVa\n1JZJaDDC44DCKLnezDsbW43Zf8LspCKBYP\nEY gave no addresses for cold wallets compatible with any of the exchange\u2019s other major cryptocurrencies, like ether and litecoin, though it mentioned that it is investigating three other potential cold wallets which may be related to the exchange.\nOf the Bitcoin wallets provided, five have been empty and inactive since April 2018 (with the exception of QuadrigaCX\u2019s \u201cinadvertent\u201d sending of 104 bitcoin from its hot wallets to these addresses after filing for creditor protection). Only one, the sixth on the list above, has seen recent activity; its last transaction was December 3, 2018, an output that would empty the wallet completely six days before Gerald Cotten\u2019s death. In total, 2,776 BTC ($14 million CAD at the time of writing) passed through the cold wallets. Even factoring in bitcoin\u2019s price at its all time high, these 2,776 bitcoin would only account for just over $74 million CAD \u2014 just under a third of the $250 million the exchange owes its clients.\nThe monitor indicates in the report that QuadrigaCX employees were unable to explain why the cold wallets have been empty for so long. Typically, exchanges keep the vast majority (~90-95 percent) of funds in cold wallets, and Robertson said in her affidavit that, to her knowledge, Cotten stored the majority of user funds in these cold wallets.\nIn the same affidavit, Robertson attested that \u201cmost of [QuadrigaCX\u2019s] business \u2026 was being conducted by Gerry wherever he and his computer were located.\u201d\nGhost Accounts\nSince the monitor can\u2019t find funds in QuadrigaCX\u2019s cold wallets, it\u2019s looking elsewhere, both internally and externally at other exchanges to be exact.\n\u201cDuring interviews with the Applicants\u2019 representatives, the Monitor was advised of fourteen (14) user accounts that may have been created outside the normal process by Quadriga,\u201d the report reads.\nThese \u201cinternally created\u201d accounts were registered under various aliases \u201cwithout a corresponding customer and [were] used to trade on the Quadriga platform.\u201d Deposits related to these accounts \u201cmay have been artificially created and subsequently used for trading on the Quadriga platform,\u201d a practice that could amount to fraud.\nThe report continues to state that the monitor discovered \u201csignificant volume[s] of transaction activity\u201d from each account, including withdrawals to addresses that do not belong to QuadrigaCX.\nLooking into QuadrigaCX\u2019s ties to other exchanges, EY identified accounts at four other exchanges which were under the auspice of either Cotten or QuadrigaCX. Only one of these exchanges has responded to the monitor\u2019s inquiry into Cotten/QuadrigaCX\u2019s account activity, and the information matched with data QuadrigaCX provided relating to the accounts.\nThe report does not disclose which exchanges were used, though the findings corroborate research James Edwards of cryptocurrency research site Zerononcense has published. In his latest transaction analysis, Edwards claims that QuadrigaCX funneled ether funds through various exchanges; namely, Kraken, Poloniex, Binance and Bitfinex.\nA step in the right direction, the monitor indicated that QuadrigaCX\u2019s exchange processes (both its own and with others) are in the preliminary stages of investigation.\nTo get a full picture of the exchange\u2019s activity, it has placed a request with Amazon Web Services, QuadrigaCX\u2019s web provider, to view data related to the exchange\u2019s platform. The accounts are registered as belonging to Gerald Cotten and Jose Reyes, the head of Billerfly, one of QuadrigaCX\u2019s payment processors, who became further entrenched in the exchange\u2019s affairs when his bank account was implicated in drafts representing customer funds. Amazon refused to disclose this information even with Robertson\u2019s power as executor of Cotten\u2019s estate.\n\u201cThe Monitor believes it is imperative that a copy of the Quadriga Platform Data is backed up and secured with the Monitor as soon as possible. The Platform Data will assist the Monitor\u2019s ongoing investigation into Quadriga\u2019s business, affairs and potential assets that may be recoverable for the benefit of the Applicants\u2019 stakeholders,\u201d the report reads.\nSome Good News\nWith all the digging the monitor has done, they\u2019ve only unearthed enough dirt to find even more dirt to sift through before it can get to the bottom of this case. That said, the report included a handful of positive developments, as well.\nFor instance, EY has secured some $25 million in bank drafts that were formerly held in financial limbo between QuadrigaCX\u2019s motley of payment processors and a bank account overseen by the monitor. These funds are now in a disbursement account with the Royal Bank of Canada.\nAnother $245,000 from an account at the Canadian credit union, which was frozen in 2017, has been transferred to the account, and the monitor is waiting for QuadrigaCX\u2019s legal counsel to endorse another $5 million over to the exchange, the last portion of bank drafts believed to be related to customer funds.\nThe monitor also retrieved \u201cminimal cryptocurrency\u201d from one of the exchanges on which Cotten/QuadrigaCX held an account. In addition to this, Robertson has allegedly transferred all of Cotten\u2019s personal cryptocurrency holdings to aid in client reimbursement.\nA Committee of Affected Users is underway, the report reveals, but it is not set in stone yet. It also argues that QuadrigaCX\u2019s plea for a stay in proceedings of 45 days is amenable, given that the company needs to appoint a Chief Restructuring Officer (CRO) to properly handle business matters as court proceedings develop.\n\u201cSubject to the comments above regarding the appointment of the CRO and the extension of the stay of proceedings, the Monitor supports the relief sought by the Applicants ... The Monitor further requests that the Court grant relief authorizing and directing [Amazon Web Services (AWS)] to provide access to the AWS Account to the Monitor and the Applicants,\u201d the report concludes.\nThis article was updated to clarify that QuadrigaCX opened 14 alias accounts on its own exchange, not competing exchanges.", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 5}

If we close below this current level, that will mark a new lower low for the first time in about a week and a half. Although that is bearish, the real strong support level lies just below and is outlined in red in the figure above. The $3,650 level has been a pivot point for months. We saw a test of that level a few days ago, but it was immediately rejected. However, now we are seeing a relatively widespread and high volume as we drift downward toward our support level.\nIn our previous analysis, we discussed the possibility of the symmetrical triangle experiencing a throwback prior to an upward breakout. However, the symmetrical triangle\u2019s upper trendline has failed to provide any meaningful demand:\n\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, Daily Candle, Symmetrical Triangle Failed Breakout\nConsolidations that fail to continue post-breakout often lead to strong reversals. As traders buy the breakout of the triangle, they provide deep liquidity for short sellers. If the supply is high enough to overwhelm the demand, that leaves a tight pocket of bulls underwater. And, if you have an underwater long, the way you close it is to market sell it. If you have underwater longs that get stopped out, that adds additional selling pressure to the already overwhelming supply in the market.\nWe will have more information once the daily closes, but given the level of sideways consolidation over the last week, a downward breakout does not bode well on smaller time frames:\n\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 4-Hour Candles, Downward Breakout\nThe last week saw a fairly tight range with consolidating volume. On the lower time frames, we see a very decisive close below the range on high volume, high spread and very little demand to counteract the selling pressure. We will need to wait for the daily candle to have more information as we assess the market, but for now the signs are pointing toward a bearish continuation. As we test the $3,650 level (the level outlined in red), we would need to see a daily close below to give us confidence in the continuation thesis.\nSummary:\nBitcoin broke short-term support on high volume and high spread. The support came on the heels of a week-and-a-half-long consolidation within a narrow range.The $3,650 level is a macro support level that will likely be tested. If we manage to close below this level, we can expect a continuation to the downside.For now, we need to see how the daily candle closes before we can make a macro assessment of the market. We are pushing new lows on high volume, so it seems entirely likely we will be closing a new low on the daily time frame.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Founder Sergio Abril told Bitcoin Magazine he is \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the interest and support he is receiving from around the world.\nStruck by the potential success of the new Lightning network protocol, Abril created Tippin.me three months ago as a way to enable Lightning micropayments without a user having to set up an LN node.\nAbril told us he is getting more than 200 new users a day, 14,100 new users as of March 6, 2019.\nThe goal of Tippin.me is to make the Lightning network easier to use, by giving users a simple, custodial web wallet to receive and manage small amounts of bitcoin for tips and micropayments.\nTo use it on Twitter, users need only download an application extension to Chrome or Firefox, register, and sign in with their Twitter account. From there, they can share a QR code with fellow tippin.me users to receive tips through the Lightning network.\n\u201cI realized that micro payments could be huge with Lightning Network, but there were still some obstacles that made tipping hard. You needed to be online to get a tip, you needed to generate an invoice every time. It needed to be easier, it needed to be way simpler, and certainly something more appealing. And that\u2019s how Tippin started,\u201d Abril told Bitcoin Magazine.\nSince its launch, Tippin.me has sent out 16,500 tips and generated 195,000 invoices. Abril told us that when Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted about Tippin.me recently, 35,000 people visited his site in one day.\n\n\ud83e\udd2d The Chrome extension that places a https://t.co/NVpjMUDdfJ button in every Tweet is here.https://t.co/Ra3de5dr50#LightningNetwork #LNTrustChain pic.twitter.com/FIx5zBbZfb\u2014 Tippin\u26a1\ufe0f (@tippin_me) February 14, 2019\n\n\nHow Does It Work?\nTo set up Tippin.me, you can use the extensions on Google Chrome or Firefox. Some users have installed the Chrome version in Brave and that seems to work as well.\nYou will also need to install a mobile Lightning wallet, such as an eclair wallet for androids or the bluewallet for IOS and androids from the App or Play stores.\nWhen you sign up at Tippin.me, a small web custodial wallet is created there, linked to your Twitter username.\nWith the browser extension installed, a Lightning icon will show up in your tweets along the bottom, appearing after the reply, retweet, like and message symbols.\nWhen the Lightning icon is clicked, a QR-code will appear and you can scan it with your new bitcoin wallet. (The process of retrieving a proper QR code for that user is handled automatically by the extension itself.)\nCashing out tips is done from the Tippin.me dashboard.\nSecurity Is \"Top of Mind \"\nAs the Bitcoin space weathers another storm, security is again top of mind. we asked Amber D. Scott, CEO of Outlier Canada, whether she would feel comfortable with a Tippin.me wallet.\n\u201cThe risk, as I see it, isn't because the Tippin.me wallets require certain information to be revealed publicly. It's in part due to the custodial nature of the tool, and in part due to its novelty. Tippin.me is still in Beta mode, so there are some risks to users as the system has not yet been battle-tested and there is a greater chance of bugs.\u201d\nAbril told Bitcoin Magazine that the amounts involved are small so this takes some pressure off, but he is still very mindful of security concerns.\nAbril said:\n\u201cI decided to show a disclaimer at the sign up screen on Tippin since day one, to make sure that nobody was holding a big amount. I know that this sign could hold people back, but Tippin was just a side project, a fun experiment, and I didn\u2019t want people to risk too much.\u201d\n\u201cThe truth is that anything could happen, but as long as you don\u2019t keep your bitcoins in there, and do cashouts regularly, you will be OK. Also, let\u2019s not forget that we are talking about small tips, usually just cents.\"\nPromoting Lightning and Bitcoin\nAsked if the recent bear market had shaken his faith in Bitcoin, Abril said:\n\u201cDespite the current market situation, I think that nothing has changed. Bitcoin is the natural evolution of money, and it will happen sooner or later. It\u2019ll keep on growing no matter what.\n\u201cBut we need to make it easier to use if we want to speed up the process. We need to simplify everything to push adoption. A lot. And that\u2019s why I decided to build Tippin.me.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fun way to play with lightning,\u201d said Coin Center Communications Director Neeraj Agrawal. \u201cSmall applications like these are good for onboarding. It got me to finally install a mobile lightning wallet.\u201d\nAsked about the timeline for taking Tippin.me out of beta, Abril noted:\n\u201cI hope to have a viable gold product within weeks \u2026 The truth is that the Lightning Network is still in Beta as well, and that\u2019s one of the reasons I decided to hold on and stay in this phase (If Lightning Network can fail, so [can] Tippin, which is built on top of Lightning Network... So I didn\u2019t want to risk). Luckily, LN (Lightning Network) is maturing very fast, and the system I\u2019m building is really solid already, so things could change soon!\u201d\nWant to experiment with Lightning payments on Tippin.me?

Per a company blog post, Revolut users can automatically exchange \u201cfiat currencies, such as the US dollar (USD) to ether (ETH) or bitcoin (BTC), to XRP,\u201d and vice versa, based on a predetermined target rate.\nCustomers can set it up in simple steps. At the Rates page in the app, you'll select the currencies, and then define the target price you want to exchange them for. The app takes it up from there.\nAs soon as the current exchange rates match the target, the app will make the exchange automatically. If the prevailing exchange rate doesn\u2019t hit the target price, however, there won't be a conversion.\nHowever, Revolut also warned of one caveat: Due to the probability of high exchange rate fluctuations, it is possible for achieved rates to differ slightly from the target rates.\n\u201cJust remember we can\u2019t guarantee that you\u2019ll receive the rate you request, but we\u2019ll try to get the price as close to your target as we can.\u201c\nGenerally, the rule is that whenever there\u2019s high market volatility, no trade will be executed once the exchange rate skews more than 0.75 percent and 5 percent on either side of your target rate for fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies respectively.\nIn addition to that, the feature has a daily exchange cap. Customers can only make fiat exchanges that don't exceed \u20ac10,000 (approximately $11,198 USD) to digital assets daily. Also, customers can make no more than 30 auto-exchange transactions on the platform per day.\nSo far there is a limited number of currencies available for conversion. The auto-exchange feature supports fiat currencies USD, EUR and GBP, and three digital assets: bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and ripple (XRP).\nRevolut started offering trading services for cryptocurrencies back in July 2017. Then in 2018, the company drew comparisons with American trading platform Robinhood when it announced the imminent arrival of commission-free stock trading on its platform.\nThe feature is expected to be released later this year.", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 8}

In addition to subjecting cryptocurrency investors to audits, many of these same users have also been sent \u201ccomprehensive questionnaires to fill out regarding their bitcoin-related activity over the past years.\u201d Reportedly, some sixty audits are actively ongoing.\nThese questionnaires have notably included in-depth sections inquiring into various services to obscure a user\u2019s identity or transaction history. Known as mixing services, protocols such as CoinJoin increases a person\u2019s privacy by allowing them to combine their transactions with several other users, putting several layers of obfuscation between a sender and receiver. When transactions are processed using tumblers and mixers like this, it becomes nearly impossible to tell who exactly sent or received what.\nAudited users were also asked several in-depth questions about their ability to purchase bitcoin and other crypto assets anonymously, directly referencing services such as Changely and ShapeShift. Notably, ShapeShift implemented KYC account registration at the end of 2018, no longer making it an anonymous exchange.\nOther anonymous services to exchange bitcoin include LocalBitcoins, utilizing non-custodial transactions. Some users leverage LocalBitcoins to buy crypto off the grid, settling trades using hard cash and organizing them off the site (these users will enter a trade on the site but use off-site methods of communication to settle it). When hard cash is used in this way, so long as the buyer and seller don\u2019t log the trade on the website, there is no record of the buyer owning said crypto assets.\nIncredibly, the survey also asks users \u201cto list all personal crypto asset addresses that are not associated with their custodial wallet accounts.\u201d\nThe CRA\u2019s interest in such services seems to be related to their potential for avoiding government scrutiny. The CRA\u2019s Project Oversight Director Jared Adams suggested on Twitter that these services could be used for money laundering. According to Forbes, the CRA has been running a dedicated cryptocurrency unit since 2017, with its goals ranging from the auditing of users to a general gathering of information on the crypto asset space.\nAccording to the CRA\u2019s statements, the agency is \u201ccommitted to helping taxpayers understand their tax obligations when using digital currencies, and to remind them that using digital currency does not exempt consumers from their tax obligations.\u201d It went on to state that the audits are only aimed at \u201chighest risk files,\u201d and that they hope to \u201c[promote] a fair tax system for all Canadians.\u201d\nThis attitude is exemplary of a recurring problem between cryptocurrencies and government agencies. The anonymity included in the technology by design makes it particularly difficult for tax agencies to collect accurate records on digital currencies, and this can cause friction in the space. Cryptocurrency research firm CoinCenter, for example, believes that the U.S.\u2019s tax system for crypto is \u201cbroken\u201d and that it shows a fundamental lack of understanding for how these assets function.", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 8}

The hard numbers of the acquisition were previously unknown.\nThe document leak comes after a week of turbulent developments following the February 19 acquisition. Community members, namely Block Digest podcast member Janine, began to raise ethical concerns stemming from the company\u2019s shared past with Hacking Team, an Italian, man-in-the-middle software provider whose malware and spyware has been linked to human rights and privacy abuses around the globe.\nThis revelation invoked strong reactions among some community members, eventually manifesting in the #DeleteCoinbase movement.

The other 33 percent of shares, valued at $8,500 (\u20ac7,500), was held by 360 Capital, a French-Italian venture capital firm registered in Paris which invested $565,000 (\u20ac500,000) in the project in April 2017.\nThe document says that Coinbase agreed to purchase \u201cthe units of the respective total ownership representing the entire share capital of the Company.\u201d Proportional to their shares in Neutrino, from the acquisition, Ornaghi, Russo and Valleri will each receive $2,951,792.91 (\u20ac2,608,916.11), while 360 Capital will receive $4,993,401.86 (\u20ac4,413,374.16).

Slated for launch in the spring of 2019, it would be the first Bitcoin-based prediction market to go live on Bitcoin\u2019s mainnet.\nA prediction market is a novel application of blockchain technology. The betting platforms allow users to secure odds, futures and outcomes with smart contracts. Two users place funds (traditionally, ether) into a smart contract to bet on futures for any given outcome; when the outcome arrives, the smart contract automatically pays out to the winner.\nMost prediction markets are built on blockchains with a more flexible smart contract language, like Ethereum. Augur, for example, pioneered the model when it launched in July 2018 as the first decentralized prediction market to make use of Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 token contract. Other prediction markets have followed suit, including Gnosis on Ethereum and Bhodi on QTUM.\nDespite Augur\u2019s frontrunning status, Hodl Hodl believes that it can improve on aspects of the platform\u2019s operations \u2014 specifically, in its solution to the \u201coracle problem:\u201d How, for example, does the smart contract know who wins the World Cup, if bitcoin closed above $3,850 by midnight on March 8, or who won an election?\nYou need software and people (oracles) to feed this data to the smart contract. The inherent counterparty risk becomes an issue of trust and accuracy: How do you keep oracles honest and how do you verify their inputs? To mitigate this risk, Augur leverages decentralized oracles. Multiple users are in charge of inputting data/results to make sure that the reported results of an outcome are accurate and that the smart contract pays out to the winning prediction.\nDecentralizing the sources of inputs, in theory, should ensure that every prediction market\u2019s payout is consistent with real-world outcomes, but some opponents argue that there aren\u2019t enough participants on these decentralized platform to prevent bad actors from gaming the system.\n\u201cWe're approaching this slightly differently,\u201d Roman Snitko, Hodl Hodl\u2019s chief technology officer, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThe oracle [is] the two parties participating in a contract. In case of a dispute, Hodl Hodl steps in with its third key and is able to influence the decision.\u201d It is the company\u2019s belief that, whereas a decentralized system for judging bet outcomes can be influenced by bad actors, a peer-to-peer contract might be more ironclad.\nTo contrast with the established model of prediction markets, on February 27, 2019, Hodl Hodl announced their own prediction market, the first to be built on the Bitcoin blockchain. Additionally, their oracle system, according to Snitko, \u201cis not decentralized \u2014 we have a central server. But we're non-custodial. In the case of a prediction contract, both parties lock bitcoins in a 2-of-3 [key] escrow. Both of their keys are required to send the locked funds somewhere \u2014 unless they both sign the release transaction, bitcoins cannot be moved from there.\u201d\nUnder this system, there is no incentive to try and dispute the outcome of a bet, as the funds will not be released if the two parties disagree. If someone fudges the results of an outcome and both parties claim the coins, a tiebreaker ensues.\n\u201cIn case of a dispute,\u201d said Snitko, \u201cboth parties may actually never come to a decision to unlock the funds, in which case Hodl Hodl can step in and use its third key along with one of the parties keys to unlock funds in their favor. Hodl Hodl cannot unilaterally move bitcoins to wherever it wishes to because we still need one of the user's keys (which we don't have) to sign the release transaction.\u201d The company warns, however, that forcing the impartial mediator to step in may negatively impact a user\u2019s ability to convince other users to enter new contracts.\nOne solution to this problem could be having a third party mediator who, unlike Hodl Hodl, is not a stakeholder in the situation in any regard. Snitko is entertaining the idea, telling Bitcoin Magazine that \u201cin the future we might have a user group called \u2018mediators\u2019 who would take on the role Hodl Hodl currently performs in case of a dispute \u2014 with a third key.\u201d He added, however, \u201cit's probably wrong to call that party an oracle, as the decision is not made by that single party.\u201d\n\u201cAt launch,\u201d he said, \u201cwe want to keep it as simple as possible and then see what needs to be improved.\u201d\nBitcoin Magazine asked Hodl Hodl to explain how its reputation system works but has not yet received a response.", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 8}

Bitcoin Schmitcoin became popular within the subculture of the Reddit communities and now posts his daily thoughts and market outlook via Twitter and his regular stream on Twitch.tv.\nBitcoin Schmitcoin on Twitch.tv\n\nBitcoin Schmitcoin: YouTube\nAfter days and days of consolidation, bitcoin finally managed to break a new high for the first time in almost two weeks. This new high, so far, has been short lived, however, as it was almost immediately sold into by eager bears:\n\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 4-Hour Candles, New High\nOur current 4-hour candle is seeing a relatively easy retracement after days and days of an upward grind. We managed to close a new high, but it was quickly rejected and, depending on where the currently daily closes, could lead to a macro reversal setup known as a Swing Failure Pattern (SFP):\n\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Potential SFP\nAn SFP is characterized simply as a push to a new high that fails to close above the previous high. This is a tactic often used by large institutions to generate liquidity prior to a market reversal. In our case, since we are dealing with daily candles, this could mean we are in for a test of new lows in the mid $3,500s. If we manage to see a reversal, the first logical level to test is the $3,700 range. If we manage to close a candle below that and our prior low, we could be in for a nasty run to the low $3,000s:\n\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Zone of Support\nThe red zone outlined above has been our latest level of support over the last few weeks. It also proved to be a point of resistance in the past and represents a major pivot level in our current market structure. If we break below this level, it would represent a third failed attempt to hold support and could lead to a strong, powerful move to the downside. We never retested our macro low in the $3,000 level, so we could be in for a major move to test macro support. Three failed attempts to break out of our range (all three with very powerful rejections) show that our market is still very dominated by supply within our current range.\nRight now, our test of resistance is still fresh so it\u2019s a bit early to make a macro market call. But one thing that is clear is the presence of supply. When we look at Figure 3 we can see large daily candles rejecting our tests of the $4,000s and so far we have yet to give a very strong test of macro support. So, it seems logical that after three failed attempts the likely course of action for the macro market would be a test of $3,000.\nAs stated, the move is still fresh so we need to take it day by day. Keep an eye out for the level outlined in red as a close below this would likely confirm a strong continuation to the downside. We have many trapped bulls at our current level and a strong move to the downside could potentially squeeze them out of the positions.\nSummary:\nBitcoin finally broke a new high but was rejected immediately. This rejection sets us for a reversal called a \u201cSwing Failure Pattern.\u201d The failure to close above the new high could mean the a liquidity run took place for large institutions to short the market.On a macro level, the market failed to break out of our multi-month range three times \u2014 indicating supply dominance in the market.If we manage to see a strong continuation, we could easily see a test of the $3,000s before any meaningful upward progress is realized in the market.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

If passed, the measure will go into effect on September 1, 2019.\nIn its current form, the text of the bill itself is brief, providing very few clues as to how such an ambitious task will be carried out. Apart from definitions of basic terms, the bill\u2019s most concrete requirement is that \u201cbefore accepting payment by a digital currency, a person must verify the identity of the person sending payment,\u201d with an exception to be made if both parties are already using \u201cdigital currency that allows the true identities of the sender and the receiver to be known before a person has access to another person\u2019s digital wallet.\u201d\nThe bill also lays some vital groundwork for developing the tools to eventually carry out this plan. It indicates that, if passed, it would have \u201cthe Texas Department of Banking, Credit Union Commission, Texas Department of Public Safety, and State Securities Board\u201d collaborate to develop the identification tools, and in cooperateion with law enforcement agencies.\nRegulators in several countries have had an ongoing struggle to reckon with this technology and integrate it into their financial regulations and legal systems. This Texas bill, for instance, could be incredibly difficult to enforce, even with the cooperation of several regulatory agencies, given the censorship-resistance of cryptocurrency transactions.\nInstead of trying to police the development of cryptocurrency, other states have attempted to accommodate cryptocurrency into their state\u2019s financial business laws. On multiple occasions, Wyoming, for example, has shown a willingness to become a regional hub for crypto-asset businesses. In February, the state\u2019s legislature enacted two cryptocurrency laws, one that allows individuals and businesses to directly own crypto-assets without needing an intermediary for custody, and one that deems that \u201cvirtual currency is intangible personal property and shall be considered money.\u201d\nAs a somewhat incredible cross-party cooperation in these politically fractious times, many crypto-friendly initiatives in Wyoming received bipartisan support, with bills being proposed jointly by representatives from both major parties.", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 11}

Late last night, we saw another test of this support level has failed to break it thus far. On a macro level, we are in a kind of no-man\u2019s-land, following the bounce off macro support in the mid $3,000s:\n\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Macro Support Respected\nThe blue zone outlined above shows the market respecting the support zone following the high volume rejection from the high established in the low $4,000s. Since we managed to establish support on the low TF and high TF market structures, it seems logical that the next move will be a test of supply in the red-dotted zone shown above. If we zoom out even further to the weekly candles, we can see clearly that this low TF range-bound market is nothing more than a weekly resistance test in an attempt to reclaim macro support:\n\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, Weekly Candles, Weekly Resistance Test\nFigure 3 shows a test of the weekly resistance level. So far, we have seen a few tests of the area but nothing that has managed to close above the level. If we can manage to get a weekly close above the level shown above, that would be a very strong, bullish statement to make in the current market structure.\nSo far, we have been rejected twice, but if we manage to close a weekly candle above the resistance level, this could be a great sign of bearish exhaustion considering that level has been heavily shorted for the last few months. If we can close above the current high that\u2019s been established in the $3,900s, that would be bullish on all TFs down to the hourly candles.\nHowever, if this level gets rejected, it would most likely mean a revisit to the lows in the low $3,000 zone. For now, things are fairly bullish as we maintain support on lower and macro TFs. Look out for a close above the weekly resistance level, as this would indicate a change of character in the market structure.\nSummary\nBitcoin managed to establish support with its lower TF range-bound market. This support coincided with a macro support level on the daily candles as well.We are currently in between major support and resistance levels, so the market is drifting up and down as the bulls and bears battle it out.Macro resistance is being tested for a third time.

In his will, Cotten names Robertson executrix of his estate, as well as endowing her as its primary beneficiary. The exchange waited roughly a month from Cotten\u2019s reported time of death to making his passing public, enough time for his widow to go through probate and transfer the estate\u2019s assets to her name.\nCotten\u2019s will itemizes a host of high-end assets that are now under Robertson\u2019s control. The CEO left his wife his Jeanneau 51 sailboat; an airplane, a Lexus and a Mini Cooper (among other unnamed motor vehicles); and properties at 1021 Lamont Lane, Kelowna, British Columbia, 71 Kinross Court in Nova Scotia, 511 and 512 Ringling Court in Nova Scotia and 34 Little Island and Seaview Drive in Nova Scotia to his widow. He also left $100,000 for the continued care of his two chihuahuas, Gully and Nitro.\nAccording to Canadian news outlet the Chronicle Herald, Robertson has taken out a second mortgage on each of these properties and placed at least two in a trust fund called the Seaglass Trust, a strategic legal move that lawyers told the outlet could add a layer of insulation between the assets and creditors in the ongoing QuadrigaCX litigation. Bitcoin Magazine could not independently validate that the trust exists.\nThe Chronicle Herald also reports that Robertson has sold the Kinross property for $1.1 million CAD. A source close to the matter, who asked to remain anonymous, told Bitcoin Magazine that they spoke with a real estate agent who claims to have represented Robertson in the house\u2019s sale.\nCotten\u2019s sailboat was also reportedly listed for sale for nearly $500,000 CAD, though the post has since been taken down (archived link here).\nAnother dozen properties in Halifax valued at roughly $6 million CAD are reportedly under the management of Robertson\u2019s real estate company, Robertson Nova Property Management Inc., according to the Chronicle Herald. Robertson is listed as the company\u2019s director, president/secretary and recognized agent, according to Nova Scotia public records, with the couple\u2019s former Kinross residence listed as its office. In his will, Cotten dictated that his shares in the company are to be jointly shared between Robertson\u2019s mother Carol Terry and her spouse Thomas Beazley.\nAs reported by Bitcoin Magazine, QuadrigaCX customers report receiving funds from Robertson Nova Property Management Inc.

Wood was also impressed with the complementary expertise the two firms represent and the synergy they employed to exploit their expertise efficiently on behalf of their clients.\n\u201cMiller Thompson has additional depth in certain areas, including larger CCAA proceedings and cryptocurrency ...The relationship between the two firms has been thought out carefully with a view to minimizing costs. Cox & Palmer will deal with their areas of expertise, including local litigation practice and court appearances. Miller Thompson will provide expertise in dealing with large creditor groups and cryptocurrency technology,\u201d the judge wrote in the court statement.\n\u201cThey propose a limited initial mandate and a cap on counsel fees in recognition of the reality that it is the users who will ultimately be paying,\u201d he continued.\nDividing labors and setting a cap of $250,000 for legal fees to cut costs for an already cash-strapped creditor base is prudent, Justice Wood points out, as is the co-op\u2019s plan to set up an online communication medium for creditors.\nIn the initial hearing to designate counsel, the judge made note of the role online \u201cchatrooms\u201d for the dissemination of information regarding the situation (he\u2019s referring most ostensibly to Reddit, which has become a fertile ground for discussion and speculation since the fiasco started unravelling).\nMiller Thompson/Cox & Palmer have proposed a \u201creasonable\u201d alternative, the judge claimed, while agreeing that \u201csome presence in social media and online discussion groups is necessary in order to reach the user group members.\u201d This counsel-sponsored medium would hopefully add clarity and legitimacy to Reddit\u2019s unverified accounts.\nThe judge\u2019s decision comes as the Canadian Bitcoin community is vexed with questions over where their money went after QuadrigaCX CEO Gerald Cotten allegedly died in India last December with the only knowledge of the exchange\u2019s cold wallet keys.\nMany theories have cycled through social media, including conspiracies that Cotten faked his death, scuttlebutt of the type that has made the judge wary of Reddit\u2019s use as an avenue for information.\nStill, even disregarding these theories, more questions loom over the debacle than answers, including Jennifer Robertson\u2019s (Cotten\u2019s widow) involvement in the company and activity after the CEO\u2019s death and the exchange\u2019s sources of liquidity, which apparently favored sending cash in the mail or redeeming it to customers in person rather than through bank deposits.\nAs creditor suits mounted following QuadrigaCX\u2019s inability to honor withdrawals, QuadrigaCX filed for creditor protection, which was approved by the court on February 5, 2019. Per CCAA procedures, the court moved to consolidate creditor legal representation, something Justice Wood explicated in today\u2019s court document.\n\u201cThere are two primary rationales given for the appointment of representatives and representative counsel in CCAA proceedings. The first is to provide effective communication with stakeholders and ensure that their interests are brought to the attention of the Court and other CCAA participants. The second is to bring increased efficiency and cost effectiveness to the proceeding as a whole. This latter objective can be attained by streamlining notification to stakeholders through their representatives and eliminating the need for multiple counsel to be retained by individual stakeholders to represent their interests.\u201d", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 19}

First, your cloud provider represents a centralized honeypot that could experience a security breach, allowing cyber criminals to access your data. For example, in August 2018, a fourth man was jailed in the U.S. for hacking into private Apple iCloud accounts and leaking nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence, Kirsten Dunst, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and others. So it does happen. And it will probably happen again in the future.\nThe second and more likely threat is the threat of users falling for a phishing scam. Phishing is a social engineering technique used by cyber criminals to trick people into handing their personal credentials over to a counterfeit website that is designed to look like the legitimate one.\nMeet \"Adrian\"\nAdrian uses a Mac computer and an iPhone for work and personal use. He uses iCloud for file storage. He\u2019s a pretty careful kind of guy \u2014 he likes to make sure all of his files are backed up regularly in the Cloud and synchronized across his computer and mobile device. iCloud is safe \u2014 it has state-of-the art security \u2014 and it is owned and maintained by Apple. This means that Adrian\u2019s data in the Cloud is likely to be safer than on his mobile device. After all, he could lose his mobile at any time or drop it into water.\nAdrian likes to trade crypto. He\u2019s a customer of a crypto company called Coinbase. He prefers Coinbase over other similar solutions because their service is easy to use \u2014 they cater to mainstream customers. Like everyone else, Adrian loves convenience. So, while he cares about security, he cares more about convenience .\nIf you prefer security over convenience, please disregard how you feel right now and take my word for it when I say that you are in the minority. Adrian is in the majority.\nOn February 12, 2019, Coinbase announced that customers like Adrian can now \u201cback up their encrypted private keys on Google Drive and iCloud with Coinbase Wallet.\u201d\nCoinbase is telling customers that:\nStarting today, you can now backup an encrypted version of your Coinbase Wallet\u2019s private keys to your personal cloud storage accounts, using either Google Drive or iCloud.\nThis new feature provides a safeguard for users, helping them avoid losing their funds if they lose their device or misplace their private keys.\nAdrian is a busy guy, so he doesn\u2019t have time to finish reading Coinbase\u2019s Medium post. And he generally likes to skim. Here are the basics what Adrian took away from reading the post:\nYou can now backup your Coinbase Wallet\u2019s private keys to your personal cloud storage accounts, using either Google Drive or iCloud.\nSee the difference? Of course you did. You always pay attention when you read an article. And you were half-expecting me to prove a point. I\u2019m almost certain that some people will actually need to reread both paragraphs to spot the difference.\nAdrian now goes on to store his unencrypted private keys to his personal iCloud account. He overlooked the most important part of Coinbase\u2019s message \u2014 you can now backup an ENCRYPTED version of your Coinbase Wallet\u2019s private keys.\n\n\nOver 90 Percent of All Data Breaches Start With Phishing\n\n\nOne Sunday afternoon, Adrian gets an email from Apple, offering him a special deal on a new iPhone. It\u2019s well-designed as you would expect from Apple, and there are no spelling mistakes or grammatical errors. Most people who have gone through anti-phishing awareness training would fall for this scam.\nSo why would Adrian question it? OK, he did question it. He checked the email to make sure it\u2019s actually from Apple.\n\nGreat. Adrian has now confirmed that the email is really from Apple.\nWhen he opens the link Adrian is asked to sign into his account to confirm he is eligible for the special offer. So, he signs into the website. Or at least he tries. After entering his credentials he\u2019s redirected to an error page. He gives up and doesn\u2019t think anything of it \u2014 he can\u2019t be bothered to check.\nAdrian has just fallen for a phishing scam. His personal credentials to iTunes are compromised. Adrian is no different from most people: He uses the same username and password for his iCloud account because it\u2019s convenient and it\u2019s easy for him to remember. How can anyone expect him to remember 134 different passwords?\nMeet \"Vlad\"\nVlad is a cyber criminal and he\u2019s the one who sent Adrian the spear-phishing email. He now has access to Adrian\u2019s private key. And the rest of the story, as they say, is history. It\u2019s history being repeated. There\u2019s more to this social engineering tactic but it\u2019s still rather easy for Vlad to gather all of the other information that he needs to finish his heist.\nI have advised dozens of executives, including founders of crypto companies over the past two years. When advising them on cybersecurity best practices I learned that no matter how well informed a person is, in regards to cybersecurity, they can easily fall for a sophisticated phishing scam.\nEven I couldn\u2019t tell that the Apple lookalike email above was a fake until I investigated further. I\u2019m not the average consumer \u2014 so what hope do they have? Most people will not investigate to make sure this is a legitimate email. They will open the link, sign into what they think is an Apple website and BOOM \u2014 their credentials are stolen.\n$1.8 million - the average cost of a phishing attack on a mid-size company in the U.S.\n6.4 billion - number of spoofed messages sent every day\n30% - the percentage of phishing emails that are opened by employees\n136% - the increase in exposed losses between 2016 and 2018\nSource: An Osterman Research white paper published August 8, 2018\nWhat else does Adrian store on iCloud? Everything!\nI personally don\u2019t recommend storing anything that is as sensitive as your private keys in the Cloud, even if they are encrypted. But I wouldn\u2019t call out a person for doing it. It\u2019s probably safe \u2014 for them.\nIt\u2019s not OK, however, for a prominent company such as Coinbase, to make such a recommendation to customers. I was extremely surprised by their decision to promote this level of convenience over security.\nI would like to strongly urge Coinbase to reverse their recommendation. Can they be blamed if Adrian decides to store unencrypted keys in iCloud even though it was recommended that he store his encrypted keys? Some would say yes, it\u2019s irresponsible. I received messages across Telegram, Twitter and email from our community members who were exasperated by the recommendation.\nThe Ripple Effect\nGiven that people tend to exaggerate or extend what they have been told, it\u2019s very likely that some customers will now extend the advice given to them by Coinbase. In that context, Megan asks Adrian for some advice on how to store her passwords. Adrian recalls Coinbase advising iCloud as a secure place for private keys, so it must be safe for passwords. So he advises Megan to save her usernames and passwords in her iCloud account.\nUnless cybersecurity becomes part of the fabric of blockchain and crypto with stakeholders taking it more seriously, it will take much longer for this amazing technology and currency to get the mass adoption that it deserves.\n\n\nThis is a guest post by Paul Walsh.

Over the years, this decentralized digital currency came to mean different things for different people. For some, it presented opportunities for prosperity, becoming the best performing asset in their portfolio. For others, this peer-to-peer cash for the internet represents a non-confiscatable digital gold that could enable financial sovereignty. For those who are concerned about civil liberty, Bitcoin\u2019s censorship resistance and permissionlessness define it as free speech money. \u201cYellow Vest\u201d protesters occupying in the streets of Paris found allies in this rebel crypto that promises to end the tyranny of central banks.\nAs Bitcoin reached its 10-year anniversary last month, this breakthrough of computer science now further reveals its value proposition. Perhaps the fundamental ethos of this technology is hidden in the mystery surrounding the identity of its creator, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. The genesis of Bitcoin is rooted in anonymity.\nBehind the mask of this Japanese character, a deeper vision of Bitcoin is found in the story of Japan, the first and only nation to experience the horror of nuclear weapons. The devastation that this country went through at the end of the World War II teaches us consequences of war and calls for people to come together for peace. This commitment to peace is embodied in Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution, with its notable Article 9 clause that renounces war as a means to solve conflicts.\nIn our contemporary post-Cold War world, this enshrinement of peace has shown itself to be vulnerable to international and domestic pressures to destroy it. In recent years, as North Korea\u2019s repeated missile tests threaten stability in the Pacific region, there has been a push toward Japan\u2019s remilitarization.\nNow, from the internet, Satoshi, a representative cultural survivor of atomic bombs, brings to humanity a means to secure this peace, opening a new path for us to never repeat the tragedy of the past.\nMonopoly of Violence\nThe weakness of the Japanese peace constitution is found in its foundation. Article 9 of Japan\u2019s renunciation of the sovereign right of war is part of the constitution that was imposed by General MacArthur after the United States defeated Japan\u2019s imperialism in 1945. The integrity of this model of governance called \u201cdemocracy\u201d that Japan adopted after its surrender relies on the U.S.\u2013Japan security alliance that placed Japan under the umbrella of U.S. protection.\nThe security and stability of this system is backed by a monopoly of violence. Its nucleus was developed during WWII by physicists working on the Manhattan Project and by the establishment of a large, armed industry that has now morphed into the military industrial complex.\nWith creation of nuclear weapons, humanity tried to outdo the force of nature, unleashing power that could bring total annihilation of life on the planet. Around this elusive power, those who are driven by an urge for domination have created a network of security to protect their private interests. The global security state has established a secret law that violates our fundamental right to life: the right not to be vaporized or eradicated by warfare.\nBy using the threat of weapons of mass destruction, transnational corporations engage in conquest of territory. They control world resources, with central banks printing money out of thin air and weaponizing large financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The superpower state has caused the entire world to fear an uncontrolled fission chain reaction in order to keep all nations under the thumb of its military command, imposing petrodollar hegemony. Armies of economists, legislators and regulators apply pressure to maintain monopoly of the market, putting sanctions, trade embargoes and blockades against those who challenge the legitimacy of the corporate state.\nCryptographic Proof\nNow, in this digital age, man\u2019s subversion of nature has come online, forming patronage networks that act like one giant computer. The internet has been effectively militarized with the penetration of intelligence agencies and the CIA cyber weapon, along with giant tech companies engaging in censorship. This occupation of cyberspace is maintained by private paying processing companies like Visa, PayPal and Mastercard controlling the flow of money, freezing assets and restricting transactions.\nBitcoin offers an alternative to this universal security system backed by men with guns. It creates a new model of security based on cryptographic proof that can resist unlimited applications of violence, making a bulletproof network.\nBitcoin is free software where users control the programs. Everyone can read, study and participate in the development of its code. Bitcoin is developed and stewarded by a group of cypherpunks. They are a new wave of scientists who take up moral obligations to shift the balance of power and to help individuals counter illegitimate authority derived from violence.\nCypherpunks don\u2019t conquer nature. They liberate wisdom inherent in nature by keeping its source code open. Cypherpunks write code. They try to preserve a repository of scientific knowledge that belongs to humankind and build applications that benefit all. By using cryptography for social change, they challenge a model of governance that fuels wars of aggression and surveillance capitalism. Through designing a new security based on mathematics, they aim to make the subversive state secret law obsolete.\nSecurity Backed by Nature\nBitcoin\u2019s core consensus algorithm is an innovation that is created through application of laws of nature. Satoshi found the force that governs nature manifested in the law of physics, specifically thermodynamics \u2014 principles concerning heat, temperature and their relation to energy. Combining this understanding of natural law with the knowledge that human nature contains the paradox of man being selfish as well as being altruistic, the creator of Bitcoin found a way to coordinate human actions to build economies of scale.\nTech entrepreneur and author Andreas Antonopoulos acknowledged how Satoshi not only invented a new currency, but also gave us the world\u2019s first perfect market. He described how bitcoin mining is built around a valuable currency and using it as a token of reward, engages miners in a broadcast math competition known as \u201cproof of work.\u201d\nWorking with careful balance of risk and reward, in combination with game theory, Satoshi created a new economic incentive that makes miners work honestly and enforces rules of the network without applying pressure. This process leads to both the creation of money and clearing of transactions. Most importantly, it enables unprecedented security backed by laws of nature.\nNature does not create waste. The market that dynamically adjusts according to a demand with a tight feedback loop every two weeks engages miners to strive for high efficiency in a brutally competitive environment. It channels misused forces of nature in the arms race and redirects energy into building a global security.\nThe law of nature that is now restored in Bitcoin\u2019s noble architecture commands the industrial hardware manufacturers to challenge the military industrial complex. The computing power of specialized hardware, through a method of decentralization, re-networks the supercomputer of the old world. Power that is now redistributed begins to free people who are enslaved by the proprietary software of nuclear programs and state-sponsored terrorism.\nBitcoin mining, largely driven by renewable energy, counters energies that are used to maintain the existing security state that creates overconsumption, pollution and environmental destruction. This newly created network can now start to transform the death-spiraling war economy into a resilient, asset-based ecosystem.\nA Constitution of Peace\nThe way of peace is in harmony with nature. It is a society that acknowledges interconnectedness of all living beings and their freedom of expression. It embraces the equality of all creation in its diversity and solves conflicts through nonviolent means.\nNow, from what was once the land of the rising sun, from the ashes of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a protocol of peace arises. Bitcoin is a new sun, ascending to replace the explosive nuclear power. This sun radiates through the heat generated through the heart of liberty-loving people around the world. With algorithmic regulation, it expands every 10 minutes without ever exploding, circulating an abundant flow of life to all directions across the network.\nCan this cryptocurrency preserve the value of peace and defend against mighty swords, missiles, tanks and atomic bombs? The security of this system cannot be given from outside \u2014 by governments, institutions, politicians and even by cypherpunks. It can only be guaranteed through sovereign individuals across the world freely choosing to adopt this protocol of peace, a way of nonviolence as a new code of conduct for the world they wish to live in. Peace can be ensured through a decentralized network created by users running full nodes and enforcing consensus rules as a universal law of nature.\nIn a piece of mathematics, we can now enshrine a constitution of peace that can act as a truly neutral arbitrator to settle conflicts and disputes among people. This new sort of security can guard our children and a future generation from resource wars. It can shelter people against currency wars and wealth confiscation, protecting the planet from ecological destruction. Through each individual upholding this networked constitution powered by this sublime golden sun, we could end the nuclear age and leave humanity\u2019s destructive past behind.\nThis is a guest post by Nozomi Hayase.

Blockchain tech enables direct ownership of assets, and now the law does too.\u201d Since property law in the United States is in the hands of state jurisdiction, this new step is not only safe from the federal government but also can serve as a model for other states.\n\u201cIt makes perfect sense that Wyoming is the epicenter of blockchain law in the US,\u201d said Long, a Wyoming native. \u201cThat's also why institutional investors, which are prohibited by federal law from directly owning the assets they manage, can rest assured that Wyoming's digital asset custodians are actually solvent.\u201d\nThis is not the only accomplishment made by pro-crypto voices in Wyoming, however. On February 2, 2019, the Wyoming State Senate also passed a bill updating the classification of crypto assets, including a clause to formally label them as currencies.\nAccording to the text of the bill, crypto assets can be considered to have three different statuses for legal purposes: digital consumer assets, digital securities and virtual currencies. All three of these definitions are specifically registered as personal property rather than private property, formally upholding a stance that other jurisdictions overseas and abroad have taken.\nMore significantly, however, the bill also further elaborates on the specific terms and conditions for each of these three statuses. In addition to the respective classifications of \u201cgeneral intangibles\u201d and securities, the bill also states that \u201cvirtual currency is intangible personal property and shall be considered money.\u201d\nIn redefining the legal status of crypto in this way, it formally opens up the possibility for ordinary citizens to treat crypto as an actual currency on a daily basis. This, in turn, could provide the impetus for a more comprehensive tax code or new business use cases.\nWyoming has been cultivating a reputation as a major crypto haven in the United States, in a bid to angle itself as the blockchain hub of the nation. In addition to enabling blockchain into stock certificates with bipartisan support in January 2019, Wyoming has also helped make banking laws more friendly for blockchain companies last December. Many Wyoming legislators are evidently, at the very least, sympathetic to making blockchain a new Wyoming industry and further friendliness can be expected in the future.", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 15}

The new 7nm bitcoin mining processor will feature in Bitmain's soon-to-be-released Antminer mining rigs \u2014 the S17 and T17.\nBitmain also unveiled a mining rig for the Equihash algorithm used by privacy-centered crypto Zcash and an Ethereum-focused ASIC miner last year.\nAt the time, the development of ASIC miners prompted Ethereum's core developers to agree to implement a new ASIC-blocking algorithm, programmatic proof of work (ProgPoW), which restricts the mining hardware on the network.\nSecurity lead of the Ethereum Foundation, Martin Holst Swende, had noted at the time that implementing the code change would hasten the network's eventual transition to a proof-of-stake algorithm, where ether is mined by staking coins, not by burning energy.", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 18}

Yesterday, the market broke north of the channel and it has since begun to march toward a major macro level (red dashed line). This level is very significant; A test of this level will make or break the current market structure. If we fail to break through and fail to close a new high, this could be a strong bearish signal that supply is still highly present in the market and needs to be shaken out before any meaningful upward progress is made.\nAt the moment, we are currently breaking out of a large, symmetrical triangle that has quite a large price target:\n\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Symmetrical Triangle\nThe symmetrical triangle (outlined in purple) is a huge consolidation pattern and has the potential to reach the $5,000 range based on the measured move for symmetrical triangle breakouts.\nIt\u2019s important to note that we are still in a bear market, and it\u2019s possible to see a fakeout of this consolidated breakout.

To partake in cryptograffiti\u2019s charity auction, please visit the donation page and tune in to the live stream here.\n\u201cLiterally and figuratively, the Venezuelan people are bringing down Maduro.\u201d\nThis is how cryptograffiti described his latest work, a charity piece that he will be auctioning off online through a live stream in Colombia. The mural, constructed entirely of 1,000 bolivars, is painted over with a portrait of Nicolas Maduro, the autocratic leader of Venezuela whose power has been constitutionally challenged by opposition leader Juan Guaido since January of this year. In the painting, Maduro\u2019s mouth is censored with a blue bar bearing the hashtag #AirdropVenezuela, an ironic nod to the political and economic repressions the Venezuelan people have endured while also applauding their ability to persevere through this hardship.\nAs usual with the crypto artist\u2019s symbolic and subversive work, the auction comes with a twist \u2014 a deconstructive one.\nWith each donation, a bolivar from the mural will be torn off by a Venezuelan citizen. Broadcasted from C\u00facuta, Colombia, a city bordering Venezuela, the cross-border protest will allow the Venezuelans to vent political frustrations and simultaneously attract donations for aid.\n\u201cThe piece-by-piece dismantling of the bolivars by those choosing to donate crypto is meant to represent a new beginning made possible by a new form of money not controlled by any one authority. There is also symbolism in how these donations have the ability to come from outside of a region known for heavily regulated currency controls,\u201d cryptograffiti told Bitcoin Magazine.\nThe auction will also accompany a live art session where Venezuelan children will create pieces to be sold at a later date.\nSince the death of Hugo Chavez in 2013, the policies of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro have thrown the country into economic and social turmoil. With an economy ravaged by hyperinflation, rampant poverty and crime have furnished a worsening humanitarian crisis. The crisis reached a bloody impasse on February 21, 2019, as Venezuelan forces opened fire on protesters at the Brazilian border after the government refused to accept humanitarian aid.\nIt\u2019s proven difficult for aid to penetrate the country\u2019s borders. But bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have become a vestige of monetary hope for Venezuelan expats who want to send money back home, and cryptograffiti\u2019s auction will leverage crypto\u2019s borderless nature to buy aid from within the country.\nIn a partnership with AirTM as part of their #AirdropVenezuela campaign, cryptograffiti is directing all donations, which can come by way of cash deposits on AirTM, bitcoin and a host of altcoins, to the philanthropic campaign. As a wider effort, AirdropVenezuela\u2019s goal is to send $1,000,000 worth of cryptocurrencies to 100,000 families in Venezuela. Even just $10 worth of cryptocurrencies \u201ccan help a family purchase food, medicine, and scarce imported goods. Access to digital money can help introduce Venezuelans to cryptocurrencies, online freelancer platforms, ecommerce, investments, donations and other income generating web-based opportunities,\u201d the campaign states.\nFor the art auction in particular, the charity collective has set its fundraising goal at $10,000. Fifty percent of these funds will go to rebuilding the auction venue, the Fundaci\u00f3n Renacer, a daycare that provides support for families affected by the financial crisis, while the remaining 50 percent will be distributed with the rest of the funds raised by AirdropVenezuela at the end of April.\n\nI'm in C\u00facuta where Venezuelan refugees are arriving by the thousands for food, medical aid & to live free from oppressive rule. @theAirtm & I have teamed up as part of their #AirdropVenezuela campaign to raise funds for those in need via an interactive mural live-streaming now pic.twitter.com/NDVlHCAgId\u2014 cryptograffiti (@cryptograffiti) February 26, 2019\n\n\nCrypto education company Cripto Conserje will oversee the reconstruction of the daycare, and during the auction, it will host information sessions on how to access, use and store cryptocurrencies, including teaching attendees how to use coins distributed at the event to purchase food kits from one of the auction\u2019s partners.\nThis education will hopefully unlock crypto\u2019s potential for an economically disenfranchised population that needs it most. For Venezuelans, bitcoin and the like can provide a censorship-resistant method to store and transfer value, something AirTM\u2019s services are trying to make more accessible for Latin American and, more urgently, Venezuelan citizens who lack access to robust banking and a sound currency. The application accommodates more than 200 deposit and withdrawal methods, including crypto, to convert currencies to USD in order to store value and protect it \u201cfrom possible devaluations.\u201d\nWhen bitcoin is used in Venezuela, it is often as a go-between for a foreign currency and the bolivar or some other, stronger one like the dollar.\nEduardo Gomez, head of support at Purse.io, for example, told Bitcoin Magazine that when Venezuelan expats send money back home with bitcoin, they will typically sell it through LocalBitcoins to a Venezuelan trader, who will then deposit bolivars into the bank account of the expat\u2019s relative. As the economic situation has only degraded further in 2018-2019, LocalBitcoins has seen rapidly increasing trading volumes in Venezuela.\nOccasionally, your technically minded Venezuelans will sell the bitcoin themselves for USD (or another foreign currency) and deposit that money into a foreign bank account as savings. Either way, cryptocurrencies typically serve just as an intermediary for value transfer, one that circumvents the tight remittance controls and fee gouging that the Venezuelan government effects with its monopoly over currency conversion and international money transfers.\nThe AirdropVenezuela campaign wants to take the extra step in getting beneficiaries to use crypto instead of relying on Venezuela\u2019s failing fiat currency. The campaign will donate and educate these citizens on crypto\u2019s significance in their situation, as well as alerting them to online economies that may allow them to receive crypto as payment, such as freelancing.\nThis is how Gomez, who has been living on bitcoin since 2012, is pulling his family out of poverty. He began receiving bitcoin for freelance translation work online, and after leaving Venezuela, he trades bitcoin for bolivars on LocalBitcoins to send his family funds.\nCryptograffiti hopes his latest work will expose a grim situation which has continued to experience much deserved attention under the international spotlight as of late. But as much as it exposes the severity of the situation, he hopes that the part-performance art, part-visual art will reveal (and convince people of) the solution to these economic woes.\n\u201cAfter reciting the tired \u2018maybe it doesn't apply as directly to you, but Bitcoin is important in authoritarian regimes\u2019 line one too many times, I wanted to do something to contribute to Venezuela and experience the situation first-hand,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking a lot about collaborative art as of late and how it helps spread the message and engage viewers. This led me down the path of a mural that was made up of many different parts that would be interactive in some fashion.\u201d\nAfter the auction is over, two pieces \u2014 Maduro\u2019s left and right eyes \u2014 will be signed by cryptograffiti and one will be sent to the highest bidder based on his or her preference. The other will go to another donor chosen at random.\nCryptograffiti\u2019s auction is the latest in artist-led philanthropy efforts. Billionaire business mogul Richard Branson hosted a charity concert in C\u00facuta last Friday. Branson hoped the concert would raise awareness and some \u00a3100 million for the people of Venezuela, and it attracted an appearance by opposition leader Guaido.\nIn the realm of crypto philanthropy, Bitcoin Venezuela, a charity organization founded by Randy Brito, also exports bitcoin funding for aid inside the country. Subsisting on donations in the ballpark of $100, the organization sends funds into the country to workers on the ground who provide food, clothes, medical supplies and other provisions to struggling Venezuelans. Once the Lightning Torch, a Lightning network payment experiment that has been making global rounds, reaches the network\u2019s channel limit, its creator, hodlonaut, intends to have the final sum donated to the charity.\nImage courtesy of cryptografitti.", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 26}

Sprague, who assumed his position a little over a month ago, states that the country has received only two tax payments so far on the state\u2019s official crypto payment platform, OhioCrypto.com\nIn addition, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re reviewing how [the program] might be either curtailed or might be expanded, and what our counter-party risk is with that vendor.\u201d\nHowever, a spokesperson declined to offer specific details concerning the exact value the state has received in bitcoin-paid taxes, claiming that such tax-related information is covered by financial confidentiality.\nStill, the slow rate of usage won't deter the state, whose lawmakers are hoping to become a major hub for the blockchain industry.\nAs stated earlier, the new tax payment system was established by Josh Mandel, who viewed cryptocurrencies as a legitimate form of money.\nAt the time, Mendel said:\n\u201cOur biggest motive here was to give taxpayers more options in paying their taxes,\u201d going further to tell Bloomberg that the state was \u201cproud to do our small part and take this small step to make Ohio the first state in America to enable taxpayers to be able to pay via cryptocurrency.\u201d\nAccording to reports, the filing process for making these payments includes three steps.\nThe first step is registration. Businesses have to register with the Office of the Ohio Treasurer and set up their accounts on the state\u2019s tax payment platform. From there, they would enter their tax details (including tax period and the payment amount) on the platform, after which time they can pay their taxes with bitcoin from a \u201ccompatible\u201d wallet (these include the BRD, Mycelium and the Bitcoin Core client, as well as others \u201ccompatible with the Bitcoin Payment Protocol\u201d).\nOnce made, the payments are processed by BitPay, the Atlanta-based bitcoin payment processing firm.

Also, the participants in the network should have the option to make real-time choices as they please.\n\u201cIt could be Ripple, and it could be Bitcoin, but it would also probably include other instruments, like stablecoins, and even eventually soon \u2014 hopefully \u2014 Central Bank\u2013issued digital currencies,\u201d Lund concluded.", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 22}

This particular pennant is quite sizable as it is consolidating at the top of a 12% market rally that pushed the price to test the $4,000 range.

A video proving that the exploit code worked was shared on Hilliard\u2019s Twitter account last week.\nHilliard is offering to disclose the vulnerability to Bitmain but under one condition: Bitmain would have to comply to the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL), the popular open source license that the Chinese mining giant is currently breaching, and open source its firmware.\n\u201cBitmain firmware is very buggy in general,\u201d Hilliard told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cand it's important for the health of the Bitcoin network that users be able to fix the bugs Bitmain introduces.\u201d\nThe Exploit\nHilliard, who is perhaps best known for proposing BIP91, discovered the vulnerability several weeks ago by auditing a firmware update file on Bitmain\u2019s support site. While details have not yet been disclosed, the exploit was found in firmware of the S15, the company\u2019s most powerful SHA256 miner in store. Hilliard thinks the same vulnerability almost certainly exists in all of Bitmain\u2019s mining firmware.\n\u201cI\u2019m also quite sure there are many other vulnerabilities in the firmware,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is very poorly designed when it comes to security.\u201d\nWhen exploited, the vulnerability gives users root access to the machine \u2014 which is supposed to be impossible. In theory, this can be done remotely using just the IP address of the miner, and means the machine can be reprogrammed to do just about anything. This includes mining to a different Bitcoin address or having it stop mining entirely. The firmware could also be replaced by different firmware altogether (such as Braiins OS or Dragonmint firmware).\nIn practice, however, it\u2019s unlikely the machines can be remotely exploited at all. For one, as long as the miner is properly firewalled and/or protected with a strong username and password, it cannot be broken into. And second, without access to the firmware\u2019s source code, it's difficult to make compatible custom firmware. As such, this specific vulnerability is perhaps not the main issue. \u201cThe bigger problem is that Bitmain firmware is generally quite buggy,\u201d said Hilliard.\nIndeed, this is not the first time a vulnerability has been found in Bitmain\u2019s firmware. In early 2017, an anonymous security engineer found that almost all Antminer machines could be shut down remotely. Dubbed \u201cAntbleed,\u201d this previous vulnerability could have probably knocked about half of all hash power on the Bitcoin network offline. It was arguably not just a problem for Antminer owners, but a security risk for the entire Bitcoin network.\nThe License\nHilliard and 00whiterabbit have not released the exploit code \u2014 but they are developing a version of it to be released eventually. The two are also willing to disclose the vulnerability to Bitmain, allowing the hardware producer to patch their firmware and fix the vulnerability. But only if Bitmain stops breaching the GNU GPL.\nBitmain\u2019s firmware is built on the Linux operating system as well as cgminer: open source mining software developed by Hilliard and others. Both Linux and cgminer are licensed under the GNU GPL. This widely used open source license allows anyone the freedom to run, study, share and modify the software \u2014 under the condition that the resulting software is free, too.\n\u201cLegally, therefore, Bitmain\u2019s firmware should be open source as well,\u201d Hilliard explained. \u201cBut Bitmain doesn\u2019t seem to care about following copyright law. Unfortunately, closed source firmware is not a good thing to have on the Bitcoin network, as stuff like Antbleed can be hidden in it. It's a centralization risk.\u201d\nIt is not very clear why the mining giant is breaching the GNU GPL. Hilliard suspects it is \u201cprobably to prevent users from overclocking their machines and support costs associated with that.\u201d Others have suggested Bitmain may prefer to keep its firmware closed source because this makes it harder for attackers to find vulnerabilities.\nSo far, Bitmain has not commented on the exploit at all, and its firmware is still closed source. As such, there is little reason to believe the company will change its ways now \u2014 though Hilliard remains hopeful Bitmain will comply with the GPU GPL and encourages users to file a request to have the code open sourced.\n\u201cIn the past they have released what appeared to be the real source, presumably because there was public pressure to do so,\u201d Hilliard said. \u201cSo, maybe?\u201d\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Bitmain to ask what the company knew of the vulnerability that Hilliard found and if it had plans to fix it. We also asked if they had any intention of complying with the GNU GPL. In response, a Bitmain spokesperson issued the following statement:\n\"We are truly grateful to the open-source community in identifying potential vulnerabilities and we are actively investigating the matter. We will continue to do what is necessary to ensure the best and safest possible mining experience for Antminer customers.\"\nUpdate (February 28, 2019):\n\n\nFrom what I can tell @BITMAINtech/@Antminer_main has still failed to fix the vulnerability I found even with this update. https://t.co/ERGeEaiI3C\u2014 James Hilliard (@james_hilliard) February 28, 2019\n\n\n", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 20}

This band of resistance has been mentioned several times in our analyses over the last few weeks as it has proven impossible to overcome for the time being:\n\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Failed Breakout\nThis run to the low $4,000s coincided with a breakout of a rather large symmetrical triangle consolidation shown above. It managed to establish a new, local high but was immediately rejected on high volume and very high spread. This rejection formed a candle called a \u201cbearish engulfing candle\u201d that completely wiped out a week and a half\u2019s worth of gains in just a couple hours.\nThis rejection should not be underestimated as it represents a failed consolidation. Patterns that break out and see 100% retracements to the breakout point often are signs of a potentially strong market reversal. In our case, it would be a reversal of our local uptrend.\nThis rally represents a third failure to break our bearish market structure and likely means we will be visiting the low $3,000s to test support/demand once again. Sitting just below our current market low is a strong, macro support level that could see a test if the demand is weak:\n\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, Weekly Candles, Macro Support Level\nA test of the zone between $2,900 and $3,100 almost seems inevitable, given the amount of failed rallies and constant supply surfacing in the low $4,000s. However, if we manage to continue the uptrend, the milestone we must keep an eye out for is a daily close above the $4,250 level shown in Figure 1. A close above that level will represent the first higher high since we bottomed at $3,100.\nFor now, the market structure remains bearish as we continue the trend of lower highs. The rallies are becoming weaker and the supply is drowning the remaining demand toward the top of our trading range:\n\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, High Volume Rejections\nWhen looking at the health of these rallies, it becomes apparent that the efforts vs. results of the rallies are lopsided. We see a high amount of effort by the bulls to move the price and a relatively low amount of effort from the bears to wipe out days\u2019 worth of progress.\nIf we manage to retest the bottom of the trading range, we will gather more evidence as the market tests the strength of the demand. For now, it appears the bulls are running out of steam. As mentioned earlier, if we manage to continue the uptrend, keep an eye out for the $4,250 level, as a close above it will show a break in the currently bearish market structure.\nSummary:\nOver the weekend, a strong round of selling wiped out a week and a half\u2019s worth of buying pressure.The selling coincided with a failed symmetrical triangle breakout \u2014 this often leads to power market reversals.Bullish pressure seems to be waning as every attempted rally is quickly dispatched by strong bearish pressure.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Currently, Ebang is the third largest manufacturer of cryptomining equipment.\nThere is one main reason that Ebang might have a solid chance of moving up in the mining manufacturing world: Bitmain\u2019s recent financial troubles. Also based in China, Bitmain is currently China\u2019s unequivocal leader in ASIC mining hardware manufacturing. Canaan, the second largest company on the list, is centered in China as well.\nTroubles have been brewing on the horizon for Bitmain for quite some time, however. Last year, the company decided to heavily invest its funds into bitcoin cash, divesting itself of bitcoin holdings in favor of the cryptocurrency\u2019s first forked coin. This quickly spelled trouble on the horizon for the company, as BCH lost money in the bear market; this loss was compounded after bitcoin cash had its own hard fork on November 15, 2018.\nSince then, trouble has continued to plague China\u2019s leading mining manufacturer. In addition to announcing a series of layoffs in late December, in February it was reported that the company had lost $500 million in the third quarter of 2018, with an IPO financial filing as the source. In reference to the CoinDesk article, Bitmain told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cThe rumor is false.\u201d\nUnder uncertain market conditions, Ebang has decided to take a gamble and attempt to capitalize on Bitmain\u2019s rumored instability. According to Ebang\u2019s own figures, the company produced 159,000 units of mining machines in 2017 and more than 309,000 units in the first half of 2018. Ebang went on to state that they \u201cexperienced significant decreases in revenue and gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the preceding three months ended June 30, 2018.\u201d Nevertheless, the plan continues to focus on ramping up production to 400,000 units.", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 25}

Ortiz took control of the identities of over 20 people, stealing a total of $5 million in cryptocurrencies with his SIM swapping technique. He pleaded guilty and accepted the plea deal of 10 years jail time.\nHow SIM Swapping Works\nSIM swapping is a technique that involves a criminal contacting the service provider of a target victim. The hacker will then use personal information acquired about a potential target to persuade the service provider to effect a phone number transfer from the current SIM card to one owned by the hacker. As soon as the swap has been executed, the hacker can request sensitive information including verification codes, one-time passwords and two-factor authentication entries, which are usually sent to a user\u2019s mobile phone as part of a successful porting process. SIM swappers are known to target high-security online domains such as social media accounts, email addresses, bank accounts and cryptocurrency wallets.\nOther High Profile SIM Swapping Cases\nVarious SIM swapping cases have been reported lately, including Dawson Bakies, a tech-savvy criminal who used the same technique to make off with thousands of dollars in cryptocurrencies from over 50 victims across the U.S.\nPer a press release from the Manhattan District Attorney's office, Bakies has been charged by a grand jury in the state of New York, and he currently faces a 52-count charge, including computer tampering, grand larceny, and identity theft. Bakies pleaded not guilty to the charges leveled against him, and he was subsequently released on a $100,000 bail.\nLast year, American crypto investor and businessman Michael Terpin sued AT&T for $233.8 million over fraud and gross negligence on the part of the service provider which resulted in a SIM swapping operation that cost him millions of dollars in digital assets.\nThree million tokens were stolen from Terpin\u2019s crypto account, with a total worth of $23 million, at the time.

News website CoinDesk obtained what appears to be a copy from the Indian government of Gerald Cotten\u2019s death certificate, although his name is misspelled.\nOn January 31, 2019, the exchange went offline posting a statement that they had filed for creditor protection.\nMore than a month after Cotten\u2019s death, the exchange announced that he had the only access to the exchange\u2019s cold storage, effectively locking up the exchange\u2019s funds in offline wallets that, allegedly, no one else at the company has access to.

It comes with built-in, e-commerce plug-ins, has a hardware component for point-of-sale, a toolkit for developers and its own Lightning node to ground the whole outfit.\nThe suite, with its many uses, has a wide reach \u2026 a bit too wide, one crypto analysis group thinks.\nBlock Digest, \u201ca bi-weekly podcast covering the latest technical and market news related to Bitcoin,\u201d argues that Bitfury\u2019s Peach infringes on its users\u2019 privacy to a disturbing degree. To them, the Peach Lightning node is a panopticon from which no data escapes, and each Peach application is the cell through which Bitfury can see personal and financial information about its users.\nDo I Dare Trust a Peach?\n\u201cStay the !#@& away from it,\u201d Rick, one of the Block Digest ensemble, cautions during the group\u2019s breakdown of the technology.\nAn offshoot of the World Crypto Network podcast, the Block Digest cypherpunks treat the subject with earnest disgust, arguing that Bitfury is being disingenuous and even purposefully misleading about how it manages user data.\n\u201cHaving read both versions of the terms of use and privacy policy, there are a number of inconsistencies. A lawyer has said that there are a few things that, if not compliant with GDPR [the EU\u2019s technology privacy regulations], would be violating GDPR for vagueness alone. So yes, we would say there are violations of privacy going on,\u201d Janine, another Block Digest member, told Bitcoin Magazine.\nIn separate correspondence with Bitcoin Magazine, Bitfury push backed on the allegation that it is in violation of GDPR, asserting that it \u201c[complies] fully with all applicable regulations, including GDPR. We believe that our terms of service and privacy policy are indeed compliant with those regulations.\u201d\nStill, after Block Digest and other community voices started raising the alarm about Peach\u2019s privacy implications, Bitfury seemed to take notice and revised their terms of use and privacy policy for the Lightning suite on January 30, 2019.\nNevertheless, Block Digest says that the new versions, even with the alterations ,still fall shy of reassuring users that their data is safe from view \u2014 or of even fully explaining how it is used.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t just say they don\u2019t collect it; they say they don\u2019t have access to it,\u201d shinobi, one of Block Digest\u2019s crew, told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\u201cThere are two things in the code for ability to collect data. The first one is event logs that go through Google analytics, and that\u2019s for navigation in the application.\u201d This first function, he told us, was nothing noteworthy: It just logs events and doesn\u2019t collect information.\nThe second part, however, does collect information. \u201cFor these streaming payments and the payments that use a lightning id without an invoice, all of those are being coordinated through [the] Bitfury server. They can see everything: who\u2019s paying, who\u2019s paying whom, how much they\u2019re paying.\u201d\nBitfury\u2019s Lightning Peach suite allows users to transact with anyone using Lightning through payment invoices, where a recipient requests payment from a sender. Or, they can send payments through the Lightning Peach node, a Bitfury-centralized process, with a lightning id or streaming payment, both of which can only be executed between two Peach users.\nAt the very least, Block Digest acknowledged that Bitfury won\u2019t collect data from a \u201cregular lightning invoice payment.\" So if you receive an invoice from a non-Peach user, even if you\u2019re using Peach\u2019s wallet, that payment isn\u2019t routed through the Peach node and is out of their purview.\nBut anyone using Peach\u2019s streaming payments and Lightning ids will forfeit transaction information, including IP and wallet ID, to Bitfury so that Peach\u2019s Lightning node can facilitate the payment for the user. Given that Bitfury is providing a centralized service, this isn\u2019t out of the ordinary, and Bitfury updated its policy to say this information \u201cis not stored.\u201d\nQuestions and Contradictions\nMost of Block Digest\u2019s most pointed accusations are leveled at what they see as contradictions in Bitfury\u2019s terms of use and privacy policies, as well as a now-omitted clause that originally claimed to keep tabs on user data.\nIn a document shared in confidence with Bitcoin Magazine, Janine recorded changes in Peach\u2019s terms of use and privacy policies. At one point, she says, \u201cIn the older version of the policy, they claimed to collect: \u2018traffic data, location data and other communication data, and the resources of the software that you access and how you use them; time that user spent in wallet (session time); number of sessions within the time unit (for example, month); number of payments within one session; amount of payment; payment type (regular/stream); successful/failed payments; periodicity of channel opening (times per month); lifetime of a channel; number of simultaneously open channels; channel capacity; waiting time for channel opening; waiting time for lightning transaction; number of nodes, which user pays to.\u2019\"\nThis could be justified as crash report data collection \u2014 aggregated network data to diagnose the reason for a crash or bug. Shinobi had a friend run an audit, and he allegedly found no evidence of collecting data for this purpose in the code.\nBlock Digest argues that this retracted list embodies the looming contradiction that Bitfury\u2019s terms simultaneously say they won\u2019t collect, store or see data and that they may share, consult or leverage this data under certain circumstances.\nThe most apparent contradiction, Block Digest argues, comes from Bitfury\u2019s claim in the updated version that data collection is optional, something Bitfury reiterated to Bitcoin Magazine when we inquired about the privacy allegations.\nPavel Prikhodko, head of Lightning Peach, told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cThat data is only collected if users proactively confirm they would like to provide anonymized information via Google Analytics. It enables us to better understand how users interact with our website and software. That data cannot be traced back to an individual user and is a standard optional setting present in the vast majority of modern consumer software products.\u201d\nBlock Digest is unconvinced, mainly because the same terms simultaneously tell users that they don\u2019t have to provide information unless they acquiesce while it also says that, upon generating a wallet, users will \u201cbe required to provide contact information that may include a phone number, email address, username and other information as appropriate.\u201d\nBitfury, clarifying the terms in a Medium post, claims that it doesn\u2019t collect these data points. This is in conflict with the terms of use, Block Digest observes. In the agreement, it says very clearly that \u201cproviding the required data is necessary for you to use the Software. If you do not wish to provide the required data, you cannot use the Software.\u201d\nBitfury also claims that it \u201cdoes not collect, nor have access to ... information on the transactions you perform through the use of the Software,\u201d something that, Block Digest says, doesn\u2019t align with their claims that user data can then be shared or sold to subsidiaries or people buying aspects of Bitfury\u2019s business.\n\u201cIn the policy that was active before January 30th, they say that they would be willing to share or pass over this data to entities who were looking to buy any aspect of Bitfury\u2019s business,\u201d Janine said.\nThe new policy says the same, indicating that data may be shared \u201cto the purchaser or seller (or prospective purchaser or seller) of any business or asset which we are (or are contemplating) selling or purchasing. Except as provided in this privacy policy, we do not intend to sell, share or rent your information to third parties.\u201d\nJanine makes the point that, \u201clegally, saying you intend not to do something is not the same as saying you will not do something.\u201d\nThe outfit worries that, at worst, Bitfury could sell information to stakeholders in Bitfury\u2019s companies, or at best, share information between its subsidiaries, including its blockchain analytics platform Crystal, one of Bitfury\u2019s compliance-focused side projects.\nBitfury denied that they intend to share data with Crystal:\n\u201c... none of the data processed is shared with Bitfury\u2019s public blockchain analytics division, Crystal. The Crystal platform provides a more user-friendly interface for analyzing public blockchain data.\u201d\nIt should be noted that, in the terms of use, Bitfury includes a termination clause in the event a user would prefer to get out of the software\u2019s data agreements:\n\u201cWhen you use the Software, and provide the required data, you can contact us (please see paragraph 11 below) to exercise any of the rights you are granted under applicable data protection laws, which includes (1) the right to access your data, (2) to rectify them, (3) to erase them, (4) to restrict the processing of your data, (5) the right to receiving a file of your personal data and (6) or the right to object to the processing, and where we have asked for your consent, to withdraw this consent. These rights may be limited in some situations. We may, for example, deny your request for access when necessary to protect the rights and freedoms of other individuals or refuse to delete your personal data in case the processing of such data is necessary for compliance with legal obligations.\u201d\nThe Consequence of Big Business\nBlock Digest has other secondary concerns, such as that Bitfury doesn\u2019t want anyone under 18 using their software, but the bulk of their qualms come from the company\u2019s seemingly contradictory and tenuous stance that it doesn\u2019t collect your data \u2014 but could if it wanted to. Most of all, the group disapproves of how this data could be used (for legal and enforcement reasons) and that Bitfury is simultaneously telling people they do and don\u2019t store data.\n\u201cYour personal data will be stored no longer than is necessary for the purpose they were obtained for, our compliance with legal and fiscal obligations, or for solving any disputes but not longer than 6 (six) years.\u201d\n\u201cWe collect, use and store your personal data to provide services to you, to comply with the legal obligations we are subject to, if necessary, for our legitimate interests or on the basis of your consent.\u201d\nThese two separate clauses contradict the earlier statement that Bitfury doesn\u2019t store data, Block Digest points out.\nOther than sharing this data among subsidiaries or selling it in the case of a business transaction, Bitfury \u201cmay be required by law to collect and share personal information provided by you with public or governmental organizations for the purpose of compliance with the law, a court order, or to respond to any government or regulatory request, the privacy policy indicates.\u201d This was one of Block Digest\u2019s greatest causes for alarm, but it\u2019s the same regulatory compliance that makes Bitfury comply with GDPR \u2014 and maybe even why it doesn\u2019t want adolescents using its software.\nThis is getting at the crux of it. As Janine said in our talk, no other Lightning service providers \u201chave data collection policies or terms of service like this,\u201d claiming that \u201cthey\u2019re not big enough organizations to provide one.\u201d\nBitfury is big enough, and the corporation, like many monolithic crypto companies, plays regulations close to the chest and stays hyper compliant to stay out of trouble in an already internationally stigmatized industry.\n\u201cAs far as the terms, Janine\u2019s right,\u201d shinobi said about data collection in our talk, \u201cbut architecturally \u2026 other [softwares and services] are capable of gathering detailed information on your activity, but again, like Janine said, none of them have terms like that. I also don\u2019t really see the kind of history in the space and the move towards more surveillance and regulatory compliance that Bitfury is making with Peach.\u201d\nBitfury told us that it uses \u201cthe minimum amount required for the products to work,\u201d for example, IP address and Lightning ID for streaming payments and Lightning ID payments. Anything else is either optional or only stored for as long as it needs to be for the software to function properly, something that Block Digest says is contradicted in the legal literature.\nSome of these contradictions appear to have been cleared up in the revisions, which could indicate that Bitfury simply fumbled the first drafts of their terms and privacy policy and needed to make some of the language more precise.\nSo who\u2019s right and should you trust Peach? Really, it depends on who you are and what your desired level of privacy is.\n\nThe Implications of Peach:\nThere are contradictions in the terms of use and privacy policy (and in Bitfury\u2019s statement on Medium) about whether or not Bitfury asks for/accesses your personal information and data. In a previous draft, Bitfury mentioned that it collects a host of transaction data, which it now claims it doesn\u2019t collect.The legal language gives them the right to access the data if they want to for the purpose of selling aspects of their business, sharing data between subsidiaries or legal compliance.Bitfury says that they only have access to limited data (IP and Peach ID) for a short time while they route transactions through the Peach node and claims to not store data thereafter (you can transact without data collection implications by using Lightning invoices).The truth is, Bitfury has (and admits to having) access to some data if they need it for legal or business reasons. Which data they have access to and to which extent they would use it is not very clear.That said, most of this data is benign in nature (basic transaction details, for example), but some of it (IP address, phone number, etc.) is not.\nIf you\u2019re not too concerned with privacy, whatever data collection might happen will likely go unnoticed. It\u2019s not unlike the information that, say, Coinbase already has in terms of transaction details and the personal data Facebook and Google have (and are selling, by the way).\nIf you are privacy conscious, however, the structure (and contradictory explanations of) Peach\u2019s data collection structure will likely be off-putting, enabling the panopticon for data that the modern internet has become.\nAll things considered, though, you can transact without your data being apprehended through Lightning invoices, and the amount of data that Bitfury could have on you is pretty negligible. It\u2019s ultimately down to over your tolerance/comfort levels for how the business operates and shines a light on these operations.", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 8}

The new mining operation is in partnership with Seoul-based research and development firm Commons Foundation.\nThe collaboration is backed by the government of Paraguay, whose goal is to make the South American country a cryptocurrency mining hub.\nThe new center, which is a part of Commons Foundation\u2019s \u201cGolden Goose\u201d project, will help to facilitate the innovation of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies across Spanish-speaking countries. Bitfury will provide product and technical support for the project.\nThe facilities used for the implementation of the mining center will sit on about 200,000 square meters of real estate, and it will be powered by two hydroelectric power plants \u2014 Itaipu, one of the largest power plants in South America, and the Yacyreta power plant. Paraguay is known for its supply of cheap and available electricity. At one point, the country generated so much hydropower its factories could barely absorb them, forcing the state to sell the surplus units to neighboring countries at below-market rates.\nThe Golden Goose project is backed by both the government and tax authorities of Paraguay. The mining operations being developed will also benefit from tax relief, an incentive added to encouraging bitcoin mining operations in the country.\nThe site will also be powered by BlackBox AC, a mobile data center owned by Bitfury. The data center provides an amalgamation of efficient design and low cost, which is expected to provide for more effective and affordable bitcoin mining.\nJohn Mercurio, chief communications officer at Bitfury, told Bitcoin Magazine that Bitfury's mobile data centers have the capacity needed to operate a bitcoin mining center at scale.\n\"Bitfury\u2019s BlockBox AC mobile data centers have the capabilities of a full-size bitcoin mining datacenter, making this the ideal solution for mining bitcoin on a large scale with ease. The efficient design and low operating cost of the BlockBox AC datacenter make bitcoin mining more productive and affordable, and allow for the easy expansion of bitcoin datacenter sites.\"\nThe project was also lauded by Sandra Vera, a Paraguay-based attorney who acts as legal counsel to the Commons Foundation. According to Vera, the exploration of emerging digital technologies is a priority of the government of Paraguay, and an alliance with innovative and technologically progressive companies is sure to provide a wide array of economic benefits for the country as well.\nThe total number of mining centers to be opened under this project will be determined by Commons, as the firm is expected to provide further details as time goes on.\n\u201cWe are looking forward to our project in Paraguay with the Commons Foundation, and we believe that this site, powered by Bitfury\u2019s innovative hardware, will help decentralize and further secure the Bitcoin Blockchain for its users,\u201d Mercurio added.", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 7}
{"title": "Blockstream Open Sources Development of Its Proof of Reserves Tool", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/blockstream-open-sources-development-its-proof-reserves-tool/", "birthday": "Feb 6, 2019  4:58 PM EST", "date": "2019-02-06 21:58:00", "content": "Landon Manning is an editorial intern at BTC Media and writes articles for its publications, including Distributed.com and Bitcoin Magazine.\nOn February 4, 2019, blockchain tech company Blockstream announced the development of a \u201cproof of reserves\u201d tool to standardize the authenticity of exchanges\u2019 crypto reserves. The Bitcoin development company has submitted a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) to the bitcoin-dev mailing list for consideration.\nBlockstream stated that it is \u201copen-sourcing the development of the tool for feedback from the industry.\u201d Citing high-profile hacks as a reason why such services would be in demand, Blockstream is hoping to create a \u201cbest-practice standard Proof of Reserves for the industry, that offers broad compatibility with the way most Bitcoin exchanges are storing their users\u2019 funds.\u201d\nBlockstream stated that it the original idea for the tool was to build a means for its Liquid functionaries to prove their Liquid bitcoin (L-BTC) reserves to third-party auditors. But it soon recognized that there were further applications that could reach beyond Liquid and be useful to cryptocurrency exchanges in general.\n\u201cPut in as simple terms as possible, Proof of Reserves allows an exchange to prove how many bitcoin they could spend, without needing to generate a \u2018live\u2019 transaction or exposing themselves to the risks of moving funds.\u201d\nReducing Security Risks\nAs the technology is envisioned currently, the tool will be able to circumvent some of the typical problems associated with proving cash reserves, namely the security risks associated with current verification methods that exchanges typically employ. With the help of the tool, an exchange \u201cfirst constructs a single transaction which spends all of an exchange\u2019s [unspent bitcoin].\u201d\nBasically, this function aggregates all of the cryptocurrencies sitting in the exchanges wallets into a transaction, but instead of sending this transaction \u2014 and creating a potential attack vector \u2014 the tool deliberately \u201csabotages\u201d it. The transaction still shows that the wallets in question have all of the assets, but none of the assets get moved around. In this way, none of the exchange\u2019s actual assets are at risk of being spent or attacked, and the amount of currency is still verified.\n\u201cThis transaction data can then be shared with anyone that needs to verify reserves. They simply import the data into their own Proof of Reserves client to confirm the exchange\u2019s total holdings and the addresses associated with those holdings.\u201d\nRemoving the Need for Trust\nThe other problem that the Proof of Reserves tool is intended to alleviate is the technical barrier that prevents users from checking on the reserves of an exchange they may want to transact on. In other words, it\u2019s difficult for non-technical users to verify the reserves for themselves, forcing them to trust that the exchange is operating in good faith.\nAnd there have been plenty of questions surrounding the veracity of reserve claims in the crypto space which could make customers uneasy about placing their trust in an exchange. On February 5, 2019, for example, a Canadian court granted cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX bankruptcy protection and appointed Ernst & Young as monitors to help the exchange locate any funds it could use to reimburse its customers.\nFollowing the death of QuadrigaCX\u2019s co-founder and CEO Gerald Cotten, the exchange claims to have lost access to some $190 million in deposited funds, alleging that Cotten was the only one able to access his encrypted laptop where the keys and passwords are stored. This has caused many users to question whether or not the exchange actually has the stated funds in reserve.\nThird-party verification of actual cash reserves could help potential users identify whether or not an exchange is operating in good faith and under acceptable standard practices.\nPrivacy Concerns\nThus far, however, Blockstream\u2019s verification tool has at least one area of significant concern: it reveals the entire transaction history of the participating exchanges. If this problem were to persist, the tool could be used to unmask all of users\u2019 transactions with the exchange in question. Although this glitch would obviously be completely impractical for confidentiality reasons, the underlying premise of the tool does work, and the blog post states that Blockstream hopes to create a fully confidential version with the help of the new open-source development process.", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 6}
{"title": "Lightning Torch\u2019s Bitcoin Payment Is Running a Worldwide Marathon", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/lightning-torchs-bitcoin-payment-is-running-a-worldwide-marathon/", "birthday": "Feb 5, 2019  5:48 PM EST", "date": "2019-02-05 22:48:00", "content": "Colin is an associate editor and staff writer for Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0 He's proud to call Nashville his home, where he lives with his family and doesn't eat hot chicken as much as you might think.\u00a0\n\nA lightning network payment has been making global rounds on Bitcoin\u2019s secondary layer. The payment, slowly accumulating in value with each passing, is 3.69 million satoshis strong and still going. Dubbed the Lightning Torch, the payment has changed hands nearly 150 times across 49 countries. Since this article was published, it's even been to space after SatoshiLabs/Trezor CTO Pavol Rusnak broadcast an invoice through Blockstream's satellite network to pick up the torch from Blockstream CSO Samson Mow.\nTraditionally, participants announce their ownership over Twitter to seek out the next recipient. Hopeful torch bearers respond to the tweets with a lightning network invoice, and after choosing a user to trust, the current holder adds a discretionary amount to the payment\u2019s sum and sends it to the next holder.\nThe experiment has been making an impression on the community; so far, Andreas Antonopoulos has been in on it, and most recently, at the time of this writing, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey even took up the flame from Matt Odell.\n\nYo @jack,You ready to carry the torch? Send me an invoice for 2860000 sats.#LNtrustchain #bitcoin https://t.co/7BmDBidKR6\u2014 Matt Odell (@matt_odell) February 5, 2019\n\n\nThe phenomenon is an exercise in restraint, trust and altruism that personifies Bitcoin\u2019s complicated relationship between trusted and trusteless operations and parties. In this way, it\u2019s fitting. The remarkable origin of the initiative is equally as unconventional as its carrythrough: it all arose from the curiosity and educationally incentivized agency of an anonymous Twitter personality masquerading as an astronautical feline.\nKindling the Fire\nHodlonaut, a self-described \u201chodl enthusiast\u201d who has been \u201cfulltime bitcoin\u201d since the middle of 2018, is represented by a space-suit-clad tomcat. Superimposed in front of a lunar backdrop, the tomcat\u2019s expression and soft smile signal optimism. His suit is stitched with a BTC logo on the shoulder and NO2X (No Segwit 2X) and UASF (user-activated soft fork) acronyms on his right chest.\nThe diehard Bitcoin maximalist has been involved with Bitcoin since early 2013, and he\u2019s racked up a respectable following on Twitter. He\u2019s used this platform to ponder Bitcoin philosophy and evangelize like most of Crypto Twitter. But he\u2019s also used it as a chance to put his ideas into action, most recently with the Lightning Torch initiative.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, hodlonaut reflected on the experiment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been interesting to see reactions from some parts of the community. Some scowled at this from the beginning because it was based on community trust,\u201d instead of the same baked-into-the-code trust that inspires mantras like \u201cDon\u2019t trust; verify.\u201d\nHodlonaut is more interested in actions than mantras, so he started testing out whether or not you could trust the community to hold itself accountable \u2014 if community overwatch could make a trust-dependent act trustless in its own way. The experiment began with a giveaway on Twitter, where hodlonaut said he would send satoshis through the lightning network to anyone who replied to his thread. 250 people replied, and good to his word, hodolonaut said he \u201cbrushed up on his typing skills and sent everyone some sats.\u201d\nThis altruism was stoked by the excitement hodlonaut felt when he first bootstrapped his raspberry pi to run lightning.\n\u201cTransacting with lightning network is the exact same excitement I had with bitcoin when I first discovered it.\u201d\nHe wanted to spread his excitement through the community, so he took the giveaway a little further. On January 19, he made the \u201cspur-of-the-moment\u201d decision to send 100k satoshis ($3.40 USD) to a randomly selected stranger who replied to the new giveaway.\n\u201cThis thing,\u201d as he called the idea behind the experiment, \u201cjust fell into my head. I had no ambitions and I just threw it out there.\u201d\n\nSome LN fun.. - I send 100k sats with https://t.co/va7XSnFii0 to the first person I choose to trust that replies to this. - That person adds 10k sats and sends 110k to someone (Either from reply to a new tweet, or this thread).. and so on How many sats before it breaks?\u2014 hodlonaut\ud83c\udf2e\u26a1\ud83d\udd11 (@hodlonaut) January 19, 2019\n\n\nHe may have haphazardly thrown it out, but the community very intentionally caught and carried it on. Hodlonaut\u2019s impulsive act of experimentation has developed into a full-fledged social experiment and movement. After reaching its first bearer, the transnational torch has been routed through each continent (save Antarctica, which would be too impressive) and 39 countries, including the bulk of the EU. Despite its creator initially believing that it \u201cwould go 4, 5, 6 hops and someone would take it and no one would [care],\u201d the torch has passed between 139 unique users 149 times.\nTotal capacity is up to 3.69 million satoshis, and hodlonaut is optimistic that it will reach the lightning network\u2019s ~4.3 million satoshi limit before the experiment terminates, at which point, he intends to ask the final bearer to donate the funds to BTC Venezuela, a cryptocurrency charity.\nDon\u2019t Let the Flame Die Out\nThe flame, while still well fed and protected, has met trouble during its marathon across the world.\nOn two separate occasions, users have treated the torch as a personal boon rather than a community exercise, confirming hodlonaut\u2019s fears that greed may put the torch out. These opportunists have claimed the funds for themselves, refusing to conform to the precedence of passing it along. Their attempts to snuff out the flame, however, have only made it stronger and emboldened the community\u2019s resolve.\nThe first time, a few days in, the torch was lit with 250k satoshis ($8.60 USD), when one recipient took it for themselves. To salvage the situation, the sender decided to relight the torch with their own funds and resend it to a more trustworthy user. The same story happened the second go-around at 2.51 million satoshis ($86 USD). This time, the taker justified his actions with a tweet that read, \u201cI\u2019ll seize it because I can, and no one can stop me,\u201d which hodlonaut interpreted as meaning that you shouldn\u2019t trust anything but code.\nLuckily, Klaus Lovgreen, the person who sent it to this opportunist, followed the example set the first time the torch was threatened and paid the loss out of pocket, sending it to a new user. His \u201cgood deed turned out to be profitable,\u201d hodlonaut said, after he directed users to Lovgreen\u2019s tippin.me page to compensate him for his good will.\n\nAnd there the #LNTrustChain ended \ud83d\ude41Thanks to the more than hundred people who chose to pass it on! \ud83d\ude4f\u26a1\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/wCb25hYX2E\u2014 hodlonaut\ud83c\udf2e\u26a1\ud83d\udd11 (@hodlonaut) January 31, 2019\n\n\nKeep It Rolling\nThe torch has survived two potential roadblocks and has grown out of hodlonaut\u2019s influence. But that\u2019s just the way he\u2019d like to have it, even when the torch was on the verge of being extinguished.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have restarted it because I think this needs to be organic.\u201d\nThe organic nature of the initiative and the community\u2019s willingness to sacrifice personal funds to keep it going have made the experiment in community trust a success. Hodlonaut said that this shows both an increasing interest in lightning and the resolve of a community sparked by an exciting new technology, even in the harsh market climate.\n\u201cA lot of people have been onboarded to lightning. Personally, this is the most community feeling I\u2019ve felt with bitcoin for a long time. There are so many people out there who are willing to educate each other and help people,\u201d he said, expressing that lightning is important for community morale in times of a bear market.\nYou can track the torch\u2019s race to the lightning network cap here. If it makes it to the end, a handful of anonymous donors have said that they will match the final amount (just shy of $150 USD) to be donated to BTC Venezuela. If you are interested in donating to BTC Venezuela or matching the donation as well, please consult the charity\u2019s website or reach out to hodlonaut on Twitter.\nThis article has been updated to reflect new movements of the torch.", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 5}

It was quite an honor to be part of it; the conference was hands down the best Bitcoin event I\u2019ve attended since Jason King hosted Coins in the Kingdom back in October 2014.\nAt the end of the panel, we opened up for a Q&A and one of the questions was something I had never considered before. The gentleman asked if, after moving his bitcoin off Coinbase and onto his cold storage, he would be required to file a Foreign Bank Account Report (\u201cFBAR\u201d) because the bitcoin is located on all the nodes across the world.\n\n\nDavid Silver and Sasha Hodder at Unconfiscatable in Las Vegas. Photo credit: www.justlearnbitcoin.com\nSilver had the right idea telling the audience member that we can\u2019t give legal or tax advice on stage. I attempted to answer using an analogy of the foreign private issuer test \u2014 where, if you are a foreign registered company but at least 50 percent owned by Americans living in America, you must still file American taxes. I thought that if you\u2019re domiciled in America, the private key is likewise located in America, and not relevant for an FBAR. It makes some sense, but I knew it wasn\u2019t the full analogy.\nAfter the discussion, I researched it further and found some simple guidance on FBAR.\nIn summary, if an American owns a financial interest worth $10,000 or more, or has signing authority over a foreign financial account, including a bank account, brokerage account, mutual fund, trust or other type of foreign financial account, they have to let the IRS know about these assets by April 15, 2019. They don\u2019t have to actually pay taxes on them; it\u2019s merely an information request.\nIt seems a stretch to lump the Bitcoin blockchain in the same category as physical banks domiciled overseas. Nonetheless, the civil penalty for not disclosing your $10,000 or more in foreign assets is $12,459 per willful violation \u2014 pretty steep; I understand why the gentleman wanted clarity.\nSince our only guidance on how to handle virtual currency tax is IRS 2014-21, at this stage of the game, it would be a far stretch for the IRS to say anyone not filing an FBAR report for their bitcoin stored on a physical hardware or paper wallet located in America has willfully violated the law. The IRS would have to tell us they consider all private keys to be foreign-owned financial interests first. Let\u2019s hope it never comes to that.\nI remembered @CryptoTaxGirl on Twitter mentioning the FBAR previously and was able to find some great reassurance from her tweets. It turns out she asked this very question of the IRS and was told, \u201cIf you have coins that are stored on a digital wallet in which you have control over your private keys, these coins would not be subject to FBAR reporting. A digital wallet is not a foreign financial account.\nAs for your crypto held on exchanges: that\u2019s considered reportable \u2014 all the more reason to hold your own coins.\nThis is a guest post by Sasha Hodder.

To that end, his company\u2019s mobile cryptocurrency wallet app has announced a new feature which will allow investors to purchase traditional stocks using bitcoin. The new feature is built into the existing Abra app that enables users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies.\nCrypto investors in the 155 countries where Abra has its presence will be able to invest in traditional stocks, such as Apple or Amazon, as well as in exchange traded funds (ETFs), using both cryptocurrencies and fiat directly from their mobile app.\nAccording to Barhydt, everyone should have access to capital markets, regardless of where they live in the world or the amount of capital they have at their disposal. This is where Bitcoin comes in.\nThe world's most popular cryptocurrency has shown its capacity to serve as a democratic form of money by creating an open financial system, and he believes his company's app could change how smaller investors access publicly traded companies and other securities.\n\"We are building Bitcoin-backed investing products because, for the first time, we can truly democratize access to investment opportunities at global scale. It shouldn\u2019t matter where you live or how much you earn to be able to make investments and participate in capital markets. We\u2019re excited to allow anyone to start investing in global equity products and take control over their savings.\u201d\nCryptocurrency exchanges have been offering features that allow traders to do more than buy and sell crypto of late. Last year, social trading platform eToro launched a mobile trading app that will enable investors to invest in fiat currencies, stocks and cryptocurrencies.\n\"Abra is different by offering this on a global scale,\" Barhydt pointed out, in correspondence with Bitcoin Magazine. He said that the Abra app makes it easy for investors to make fractional investments in stocks, commodities, ETFs and indexes.\n\u201cThese are not tokenized securities,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are not creating an ERC 20 chain. All investments in stocks, ETFs, indexes, etc., are collateralized by bitcoin.\u201d\nCrypto Collateralized Contracts\nThe new feature will leverage Abra's Crypto Collateralized Contracts (C3s), a model that allows an investor to convert their bitcoin into different investment options, without having to move money from one wallet to another. The C3s act rather like a stablecoin whose value can be pegged with a reliable price feed to the value of bitcoin.\nFor every security purchased on Abra, the investor enters into an investment contract, a multi-sig smart contract based on P2SH scripts on the Bitcoin blockchain, which automatically determines whether or not an investor has made money based on the price of the asset. For instance, if an investor wants to purchase $200 worth of Amazon shares, he will place $200 worth of bitcoin into a contract and the movement of the stock's price will determine the addition or subtraction of bitcoin from the contract.\nAccording to Barhydt, Abra takes all the risk here, which it hedges in the open market, the instant a user creates the investment.\nBarhydt also touts the broad crypto and fiat offerings on Abra as a unique selling point, as well as its non-custodial nature \u2014 so users hold the fate of their funds in their hands.\n\"Abra does not collect, store, or have access to its users\u2019 funds.

Now, it is the new home to 21 Lectures, a school for bitcoin developers founded by Lucas Betschart. The school is registered in Zug but courses are taught in Zurich.\n21 Lectures (named for the bitcoin cap of 21 million) is the only course for bitcoin core developers in Switzerland, and Betschart is hoping that the high-profile nature of the teachers \u2014 including James Chiang, Christian Decker and Jonas Schnelli \u2014 will attract students from around the world.\nFor Betschart, starting a program like this is an expression of confidence in the future of Bitcoin.\n\u201cBitcoin itself didn't change,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cIt's still the censorship resistant, internet-native alternative to central bank money and, therefore, still very appealing to me from a technological as well as ideological point.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cPeople who understand the value of Bitcoin (not just the price) don't care too much about these short-term market swings.\u201d\nSchnelli, Bitcoin Core maintainer and Shift cryptosecurity expert, says, \"In Switzerland, the Bitcoin ecosystem is becoming more and more established and has a growing international appeal. I am pleased to be involved in a modern and future-oriented further education with 21 Lectures.\"\nDeveloping a Sustainable Business Model\nBetschart says that the program\u2019s primary goal is to get more software developers to contribute to Bitcoin\u2019s open source projects: He and his team are \u201cnot interested in making a profit.\u201d\nA statement on the program\u2019s website lays out its philosophy:\n\u201cWe believe in the power of open source software, creative commons and that all people should be able to access information freely. This is why we publish all our teaching materials freely available to use, share, copy, distribute and modify.\u201d\nBetschart told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cThe plan is to have a sustainable business model to cover the costs of the teachers, rooms and expenses.\u201d\nThe three main sponsors \u2014 Xapo, Shift and BitConsult \u2014 are all contributing to this project.\nXapo, the Hong Kong-based bitcoin wallet and storage company, contributed startup funding. This contribution, paired with Betschart\u2019s own bitcoin earnings, was able to create a self-sustaining school with courses costing $1,500 or the equivalent in bitcoin.\nShift, the Bitcoin software company and makers of the Swiss Bitcoin Hardware wallet, is lending four of its developers as lecturers including Marko Bencun, Jonas Schnelli, Kaspar Etter and Henrik Jonsson.\nBitConsult provides free hardware wallets and other tools to students in the program.\nOnly Bitcoin Taught Here\nThe courses only cover Bitcoin \u2014 general knowledge, protocol, cryptography and Lightning \u2014 and use libbitcoin and the command line tool libbitcoin-explorer for exercises.\nThere are two course levels: a two-day basic course for people with a technical background and some training as developers and a four-day advanced course for graduates of the basic course.\nApplicants will be required to attend in person and the requirement to qualify is \u201ctechnical knowledge and familiarity with the command line.\u201d\n\u201cThe current advanced course of 21 Lectures gives an extensive insight into Bitcoin, but it\u2019s only a starting point: The developers will have to learn and practice more by themselves, although our teachers, as well as the open-source community in general, are always very helpful to get new contributors up to speed,\u201d Betschart said.\n\u201cWe hope to collaborate more with other courses in the future, exchange ideas, content and attendees.

The Monitor is working with Management to retrieve this cryptocurrency from the various cold wallets, if possible.\u201d\nRegarding the liquidation process for distribution of QCX funds to the exchange\u2019s users, the report says that Ernst & Young has established a \u201cDisbursement Account\u201d per the Nova Scotia court\u2019s orders, \u201cand [it] received $150,000 from Ms. Jennifer Robertson\u201d (Cotten\u2019s widow) to kickstart the account.\nThe document continues to clarify that the exchange\u2019s remaining hot-wallet funds (some $902,000 CAD, of which $700,000 CAD is in bitcoin, $130,000 CAD in ether and the rest in bitcoin fork coins and litecoin) will be transferred to cold storage under Ernst & Young\u2019s management.\nIn an affidavit that comprises part of the ongoing legal proceedings in the Court of Nova Scotia, Robertson swore that the exchange had no access to the cold storage because the keys and passwords are stored in one of Cotten\u2019s encrypted wallets.\nAccording to the document, Ernst & Young has also seized Cotten\u2019s computer hardware and accessories, which Robertson originally turned over to retired cybersecurity professional Chris McBryan of McKalian Sensors Inc. to crack.\n\u201cThe devices taken into custody from Mr. McBryan include two (2) active laptops, two (2) older model laptops, two (2) active cell phones, two (2) older \u2018dead\u2019 cell phones and three (3) fully encrypted USB keys. \u2026 The Monitor\u2019s forensic group is currently working with Mr. McBryan to better understand actions that have been taken in respect of the devices and what information has been obtained from the devices to date to determine what forensic next steps will be employed. In addition, the Monitor was made aware of and took steps to retrieve Mr. Cotten\u2019s desktop,\u201d the report reads.\nRecovering Lost Funds\nThe document also confirms that Ernst & Young has contacted nine of the known payment processors that served as QuadrigaCX\u2019s makeshift banking partners. The firm has not yet received the $30 million CAD in bank draft notes that both the court affidavit and the report say are under the auspices of Stewart McKelvey, the law firm representing both Robertson and QuadrigaCX. One of these processors allegedly owes the exchange $25.2 million of the $30 million in bank notes QuadrigaCX holds. Once the banks that these processors work with clear wires for these bank notes, the funds will fall under Ernst & Young\u2019s management.\nQuadrigaCX had been using these payment processors as a stand-in for proper banking relationships. As sources close to the matter, who asked to remain anonymous, told Bitcoin Magazine, QuadrigaCX has a long history of problems in maintaining banking relationships, a tribulation best represented by CIBC freezing $25 million CAD of funds associated with the exchange in 2018. This freeze was one of many unhappy incidents that have come to define the exchange, including losing millions in ether in 2017 to a smart contract bug and a reputation for month-long withdrawal times.\nSpeculation and Rumors\nSince Gerald Cotten\u2019s death, wild speculation over QuadrigaCX\u2019s solvency, the identity of a since-distanced cofounder Michael Patryn and whether Cotten is actually dead have surfaced in the community. A purported QuadrigaCX contractor, one of the seven that made up the company\u2019s employee structure until recently, posted a reddit AMA on r/QuadrigaCX2 with potentially damning accusations that Cotten and Robertson worked in tandem to scam the exchange\u2019s users. These accusations remain unsubstantiated thus far.\nCanadian lawyers will convene on February 14, 2019, in Halifax in a bid to represent some 111,000 users affected by the exchange\u2019s misfortune, Bloomberg reports. In its February 5 ruling, the Court of Nova Scotia granted QuadrigaCX creditor protection, guarding it from further court action until the exchange and Ernst & Young are able to investigate its financial situation.", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 13}

Some coins broke their highest volume seen since the beginning of the bear market, and several others broke straight through overhanging resistance levels. Bitcoin, too, enjoyed a nice rally, rising almost 11% in just a few short hours:\n\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 4-Hour Candles, Early Morning Rally\nThis rally was very strong and sudden, running the stops of many late shorters in the crypto market. Zooming out to the daily view, we can see just how strong the move was as it nearly tripled the previous day\u2019s trade volume on very high spread:\n\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Daily Volume and Spread\nAlthough the daily candle has yet to close, it looks pretty promising for the bulls. The market is currently in the process of testing overhanging resistance and is currently testing the strength of both the bulls and bears.\nEven though the move was strong, it should be noted that we are still trending downward as we continue to make lower highs and lower lows on the daily trend. That\u2019s not to say the trend won\u2019t be broken, but it should be a matter of consideration as we take an objective view of the current market structure.\nAs the price continues to rally, the outlined resistance levels will serve as great milestones to judge the health of the bullish pressure. If we can close the two resistance levels, it seems entirely likely we will see a retest of the overhanging resistance in the low $4,000s:\n\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Important Zone for Changing Market Structure\nLooming just above the outlined zone in blue is a very important and potentially market-structure changing zone, outlined in red in the figure above. The market has been unable to close above this level for months and has been continuously pushed down with every attempt to rally into the region. If we can see a close inside the red zone, we can anticipate strong buyer interest as this represents a change in the market behavior. This will be a very important level to watch as we continue to see upward momentum push this rally further.\nAgain, it should be noted that we have yet to close the current daily candle above overhanging resistance, but given the spread and volume behind the current move, it seems logical the market is good for a bit of a continuation before the bulls lose steam. The outlined resistance levels in Figure 3 will serve as points of interest in the coming days in order to judge the health of the current market. It\u2019s important to wait for the daily close as the market is known for massive slippage due to relatively low liquidity on some exchanges.\nSummary:\nShortly after the London Open, the entire crypto market rallied on very high volume with relative ease compared to the previous weeks of attempted rallying.Several coins have seen record-setting volume for the current bear market, while others have blown straight through their prior resistance levels.Bitcoin is currently in the process of testing its overhanging resistance as the current daily candle has yet to close. There are major resistance levels to consider when viewing the health of the market, but given the strength of the current move, it seems likely we will see a continuation of the uptrend before bears begin to test their hand against the bulls.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Two pension plans from Fairfax County, Virginia, the $1.43 billion Police Officer\u2019s Retirement System and the $3.9 billion Employee\u2019s Retirement System, were the lead investors in what was originally projected to be a $25 million dollar raise. Besides the two funds, a hospital system, an insurance company, a private foundation and a university endowment also invested in the raise.\nAn offshoot of Morgan Creek Capital Management LLC, Morgan Creek Digital is a cryptocurrency asset management and investment firm founded by Anthony Pompliano, Jason Williams and Mark Yusko, and it has invested in such industry heavyweights as Coinbase and Bakkt.\nWith this latest influx of capital, Morgan Creek Digital will invest in early seed-round crypto and blockchain startups, as well as digital tokens and other cryptocurrencies.\nThe raise is the largest for a crypto firm in 2019, and it\u2019s one of the largest to occur during a bear market that is going on two years now. Speaking to Bloomberg, Pompliano said that the price is just a temporary distraction from what could be a lucrative long-term game, and institutions are starting to take notice.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a belief in the institutional world that if the industry will be around for a long time, it will be very valuable. The smart money is not distracted by price but looks at the long-term trends, and believes they\u2019re betting on innovation as a great way to deliver risk-mitigated returns.\u2019\u2019\nThe Chief Investment Officer of one of the raise\u2019s participating pension funds corroborated Pompliano\u2019s claim that institutions are attracted by the digital assets market.

(RNC) on their bank statements. Registered with the Canadian government as Robertson Nova Property Management Inc., the corporation's sole employee, Jennifer Robertson, who is the widow of the exchange's late CEO, Gerald Cotten, is listed as recognized agent, director and president/secretary, according to Nova Scotia public records. The company's office address is 71 Kinross Court, Nova Scotia, the same address as Jennifer Robertson and Gerald Cotten's former home, which recently sold for $1.1 million CAD.\nBitcoin Magazine reviewed a financial inquiry into the individual\u2019s bank account deposit history to confirm that the amounts deposited on the bank statement matched the emails.\nThe reply-to line of the message includes what is believed to be Robertson's email address (jenniferkm.robertson@gmail.com), as well. Robertson, who was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, legally changed her name from Jennifer Kathleen Margaret Griffith to Jennifer Kathleen Margaret Robertson on December 1, 2016.\n\nScreenshot of email to QuadrigaCX user\nOther QuadrigaCX users have reported receiving bank deposits from Robertson Nova Consulting, as well, showing up as ROBERTSON NOVA on their bank statements as payroll deposits (these reports were vetted by a separate anonymous source close to the matter). As was the case with the individual who originally leaked the news to Bitcoin Magazine, these deposits took place in early March of 2017. Clients also noted another email address, jennifer.forgeron8@gmail.com, as a reply-to from RNC Inc. deposits, as well.\nWhether or not the funds came from Robertson, the reply-to implicates her in the exchange\u2019s business dealings, something she swore she was not involved with in her affidavit to the Nova Scotia court at the inception of legal proceedings.\n\u201cI was not involved in the business of the Companies while Gerry was alive,\u201d item 53 of the affidavit reads. However, if a company operated by Robertson initiated the deposits, that could implicate her in QuadrigaCX\u2019s businesses and contradict her statements.\nIf [these] anonymous statements are later substantiated and gain admission into evidence,\" Chetan Phull of Smartblock Law, told Bitcoin Magazine, \"it is possible that the widow\u2019s evidence will be doubted or thrown out for lack of credibility. Many factors would be at play, including the widow's knowledge and intention.\"\nIf users didn\u2019t receive funds from RNC Inc., they may have received them in physical cash instead. The same source who leaked the information on Robertson\u2019s potential involvement in the company also told Bitcoin Magazine that they had hard cash delivered to their home as a withdrawal option from QuadrigaCX.\nThree separate withdrawals came with return addresses to Quadriga Vancouver, British Columbia, though the source said that Canada Post tracking sourced the packages to three separate mailing addresses: Richmond, British Columbia; Calgary, Alberta; and Sherwood Park, Alberta. Given Canada\u2019s vast landscape, the source emphasized that these locations are hundreds of miles apart.\nThese accounts corroborate reports that QuadrigaCX honored, at one point, withdrawal requests with physical cash, something that QuadrigaCX openly advertised as an option on its website when it was still active, multiple sources confirmed to Bitcoin Magazine. Some of these sources received upwards of $10,000 dollars in cash.\nThe developments complicate the role hard cash has played for the company in its troubled history. As the exchange advertised, users were encouraged to deposit and withdraw in-person at the exchange\u2019s outposts. One of these, the Globe and Mail reports, no longer operates as a cash repository for the company, and Aaron Matthews, a QuadrigaCX contractor, owns the property, which he rents out.\nQuadrigaCX co-founder Michael Patryn told Bitcoin Magazine that in-person deposits/withdrawals are not uncommon for the cryptocurrency industry, citing an early exchange venture of his, Vault of Satoshi, as well as other Canadian exchanges Einstein and Coinsquare (which no longer does). Patryn admitted that sending hard cash through the mail \u201csounds less common\u201d and said that neither practices were standard procedure before he parted ways with the company in March 2016.\nLess than common, the practice is unheard of in the industry for an exchange of QuadrigaCX\u2019s stature and repute, which has served over 100,000 users. Given QuadrigaCX\u2019s inability to maintain banking relationships in the past (when it was still operating, the exchange relied on a miscellany of international payment processors to substitute as fiduciary partners), the availability of mass liquid capital calls into question how QuadrigaCX managed to acquire these funds and where they\u2019ve been stored.\nMounting legal action for QuadrigaCX will top another milestone today as law firms from around Canada will meet in Halifax to win the right to represent affected Quadriga users in a class action lawsuit against the exchange.\nThis article has been updated to include public records for Robertson Nova Property Management Inc.", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 14}

However, while December saw figures recede by a small margin, the trading volumes on the exchange fell even further and sat firmly on the $1 billion mark in January.\nIt is worth noting that January\u2019s trading volume levels for Coinbase are the lowest that the exchange has recorded since May 2017.\nHong Kong-based OKEx had seen its volumes for the BTC/USD market growing from October all through December before plummeting 30 percent from around $5.5 billion to below $4 billion.\nCameron and Tyler Winklevoss' Gemini exchange also had an underwhelming year with trade volumes falling below $500 million.\nBinance CEO Changpeng Zhao made an effort to calm fears in November, telling CNBC Africa that business was going well despite the crypto winter.

By the end of the hearing, the presiding judge wouldn\u2019t make a decision on which firm would play counsel for QuadrigaCX\u2019s clients, though he promised a decision within the week.\n\u201cThe decision to delay appointment of representative counsel is a sound one. The Court needs to be able to select the right firm that can present Canadians across the country with expertise and in a cost-effective manner. Most users are in British Columbia and Ontario and so firms with solid representation there would be key, so that customers from those provinces have access to the process,\u201d Christine Duhaime of Duhaime Law told Bitcoin Magazine.\nDuring the session, the Honorable Justice Michael Wood heard testimonies from the four law firms that creditors have turned to for counsel, namely, Bennett Jones LLP; Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP; McInnes Cooper LLP and latecomer Goodmans LLP.\nJack Julian, a reporter for Canadian news outlet CBC, live-tweeted the courtroom proceedings, tallying up a total of 18 lawyers who were present at the hearing. One of these, Maurice Chiasson, represented QuadrigaCX while another represented Ernst & Young, the firm that has been appointed monitor over the case; the rest represented some 200 clients affected by the exchange\u2019s inability to honor withdrawals. These clients reportedly have $50 million CAD tied up in the exchange in the aftermath of the death of its founder and CEO, Gerald Cotten. The $50 million CAD represented today is just a piece of the $250 million CAD debt that the exchange owes its customers.\n\u201cThere are many complicating factors in this motion,\u201d notes blockchain lawyer Chetan Phull of Smartblock Law. \u201cThe \u2018creditors\u2019 are spread out all over the world, QuadrigaCX is running low on funds for its defense, and Justice Wood has one week to decide who will represent all the creditors. This must be a difficult decision for Justice Wood. Relevant considerations will likely include competence with cryptocurrency and international resources. The first factor will be important to address solvency matters as they relate to the accessibility of various cryptocurrency reserves of QuadrigaCX. The second factor will be important to cost-effectively triage client-intake and evidence management for a litigation with such a global scope.\u201d\n\u201cJustice Michael Wood says all contenders are \u2018eminently qualified\u2019 to be representative counsel. They all claim to represent similar numbers of clients with similar total losses. He says he \u2018won\u2019t be flipping a coin\u2019 and will have to analyze the submissions closely,\u201d Julian tweeted.\nOne of the firms, Goodmans, which Julian says has a client with a $1 million claim on the exchange, suggested creating a \u201csteering committee\u201d of seven individuals, which would consist of two lawyers from the other three law firms competing for representation and one from Goodmans. The committee would then be in charge of appointing legal counsel for the affected creditors. Justice Wood ultimately dismissed this proposal, saying it would amount to the firms having to \u201cduke it out,\u201d tweeted Julian.\nAccording to Julian, Raj Sahni, an attorney for Bennett Jones, lambasted the use of online chat rooms as \u201ccompletely inappropriate\u201d for disseminating information in this case. In the fallout after Cotten\u2019s death, Reddit (particularly the subreddit QuadrigaCX2) has become a hotbed of activity for QuadrigaCX customers to swap information, air grievances and cook up what most would consider conspiracy theories.\nTo cut through the noise and give this information legitimacy, one firm, Miller Thomson, suggested curating a website that would aggregate creditor information and answer questions these affected users have in public or private.\nThe proceedings highlighted that most of the creditors are individuals with fewer than $50,000 CAD in the exchange. These affected users are already down significant capital, and the legal counsels stressed the importance of making this process as frictionless as possible to mitigate legal costs for the already cash-strapped creditors. The monitor, Ernst & Young, has proposed a $100,000 CAD cap on fees beginning today, which would exclude fees calculated to this point.\nEven as lawyers are seeking to expedite the counsel appointment process to the capital benefit of their representatives, it became apparent early on that Justice Wood might not reach a decision today. The case is murky and unconventional, he said, and Julian tweeted that the robustness of each law firm contending for legal counsel hasn\u2019t made \u201clife any easier\u201d for the judge regarding his decision.\n\u201cWood says this [is] an odd situation. We don\u2019t have secured and unsecured creditors, third party suppliers, employees etc. Only clients. So it\u2019s unlikely there will be parties clamouring for changes on the next court date of March 5,\u201d Julian wrote.\nAfter a midday recess, the court reconvened and Justice Wood revealed that he would not decide on representative counsel today, as choosing between the four will be difficult. While he said that each is \"eminently qualified,\" Chetan Phull of Smartblock Law said that the ideal counsel will have to have a stellar report card for handling the technological nuance and international breadth of the case.\n\"Relevant considerations will likely include competence with cryptocurrency and international resources. The first factor will be important to address solvency matters as they relate to the accessibility of various cryptocurrency reserves of QuadrigaCX. The second factor will be important to cost-effectively triage client-intake and evidence management for a litigation with such a global scope.\u201d\nOutstanding Issues\nAt the end of the hearing, the court also addressed a number of outstanding issues in the case, including the absence of $30 million CAD worth of bank draft notes that QuadrigaCX claims that it is owed by its payment processing partners. QuadrigaCX is making haste to secure these funds as most of the $300,000 CAD it has in its possession for legal fees are nearly depleted.\n\u201cThe Court learned today that the advisors are almost out of the money allocated, having spent $250,000 in fees in a short time. It remains unclear how additional funds will be secured because there was only $300,000 set aside that was a secured debt to Mr. Cotten\u2019s widow, approved by the three new directors, the Court heard. I think they will have to solve the cash crunch soon by securing banking relationships quickly to deposit the over $20M in bank drafts they said they have,\u201d Duhaime commented to Bitcoin Magazine.\nAs monitor, Ernst & Young commented that it was close to reaching deals with some of these nine processors, though the firm was vague on the progress it has made toward decrypting Gerald Cotten\u2019s hardware, which allegedly holds the keys to the company\u2019s inaccessible cold storage, or in retrieving the $460,000 CAD that QuadrigaCX \u201cinadvertently\u201d sent to one of its cold wallets on February 6, 2019.\nBitcoin Magazine recently broke news that multiple QuadrigaCX users have reported receiving deposits from Robertson Nova Consulting Inc., a company, CBC claims, that Gerald Cotten\u2019s widow, Jennifer Robertson, presides over as president, secretary and director. Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s sources commented that email addresses appearing to belong to Robertson were listed on the reply-to lines of deposit confirmations. The same sources also told Bitcoin Magazine that they had received mass amounts of cash, at times amounting to thousands of dollars, in the mail as part of the withdrawal process.\nWith additional notes from Jessie Wilms", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 14}

Since peaking in the upper $3,600s, bitcoin has seen close to zero bullish follow-through, and the price has begun to drift downward over the course of the last week:\n\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, Hourly Candles, Downward Drift\nDownward-drifting markets like this can often be a sign that distribution is taking place. It represents an overall lack of bullish pressure. And, from the volume profile, we can see that selling pressure has remained constant throughout the week of downward drift:\n\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, Hourly Candles, Sustained Selling Pressure\nWe can see in the figure above that every attempt by the bulls to push the price upward was quickly and easily countered by bearish pressure. The highs are getting lower, and the lows are getting lower, and we can see that every attempted rally is being sold into as supply continuously surfaces.\nSimilar to the lower time frame trend we just discussed, the higher time frame trend is also exhibiting lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, the figure below outlines the key overhanging resistance levels we must break if we want to a sustained rally:\n\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Overhanging Resistance Levels\nBecause crypto is so volatile, sometimes it helps to clear things up by looking at the closing price of the daily candles. Although wicks contain very important information, if we just focus on the closing price we can get a general idea of the macro health of the market. The figure above shows us rallying above our first key level, but it has begun to slowly drift below the level once again. Ideally, we would like to see this overhanging resistance turn into support. We are currently in the middle of testing the first level so it is unfair to say whether or not the test has failed or whether the resistance has turned into support.\nIf we fail to hold support at this level, I fully expect to see a test of new lows, as this has been the trend over the last few weeks:\n\nFigure 4: BTC-USD, 12-Hour Candles, Macro Supply and Demand Channel\nThe entirety of 2019 has been outlined by a very well-defined supply-and-demand channel.

A failure to maintain this level and rally to a new high will most likely yield a test of the lower part of the channel and the next macro supply level in the the low $3,000s.\nRight now, bitcoin is just drifting slowly downward and somewhat sideways.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nWhilst debate raged throughout the Bitcoin community over whether the block size limit should be increased and how, Luke-jr for years stood out for arguing the exact opposite position. One megabyte blocks weren\u2019t too small, he maintained even as SegWit\u2019s block size increase gained broad support, they were too big. No increase, but a decrease was needed.\nNow, the Bitcoin Knots and Bitcoin Core developer is spearheading an attempt to make such a decrease happen, as a temporary measure. And if social media is any indication, the initiative is attracting more interest than many might have expected it would.\n\u201cI don't know if the proposal will be adopted or not, but support has been growing due to the block size becoming more and more apparently a problem,\u201d Luke-jr told Bitcoin Magazine.\nBlock Size Decrease\nOf course, the arguments for decreasing the block size limit are similar to the by now oft-repeated arguments against increasing the block size limit. In short, bigger blocks add to the cost of running a node (making it more expensive for users to enforce the protocol rules), could increase mining centralization (risking censorship resistance), and reduces fee pressure (translating into less hash power security).\nThe most pressing problem of these, for Luke-jr, is the cost of running a full node. This is perhaps best exemplified by the time it takes to initially sync such a node. Getting up to speed with the rest of the network can take days even on modern laptops with a good internet connection.\n\u201cUsers acting on that cost by simply choosing not to run a full node is a problem,\u201d Luke-jr said. \u201cWhen someone does finally attack Bitcoin, it will split the network \u2014 full node users on one chain, and light wallet users on the other.\u201d\nIn case of such a broad scale attack on light wallet users, \u201ca New York Agreement-in-secret,\u201d Luke-jr envisions a worst-case scenario where these users would rather continue to use the invalid chain they\u2019d been defaulting to since the attack, instead of switching back to the original chain.\n\u201cWhich side prevails inevitably depends on the economic pressure of users of each chain. If most people are using light wallets, then full node users will lose out, and the invalid chain effectively becomes simply a hard fork to Bitcoin,\u201d he argued, leaving little room for nuance. \u201cThat means all protocol rules are open to change, including the ones that forbid inflation, theft, etcetera.\u201d\nFollowing Luke-jr\u2019s reasoning, Bitcoin is well into the danger zone already, as relatively few users rely on full nodes to accept payments. And it may be getting worse. Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain grows each day, and while Moore\u2019s Law and similar trends of computational improvements negate the associated problems with this growth to an extent, the Bitcoin Knots lead maintainer thinks technological progress is not yet keeping up. (It\u2019s no exact science, but the drop in reachable node count over the past year could suggest that the blockchain size is indeed becoming a problem for more users \u2014 then again this node count is up over the past two years.)\nOn the flip side, the main argument against smaller blocks is that it would limit the number of transactions the Bitcoin network would be able process, which increases fee pressure, and could out-price certain use cases. (Instead of running full nodes, users may opt to rely on custodial services to save on fees, arguably making matters worse \u2014 not better.)\nBut with the development of the Lightning Network making noticeable progress, proponents of a block size limit decrease believe this downside is largely mitigated. Users would be incentivized to migrate to the overlay network for fast and cheap transactions, furthering its growth and taking the load off Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain at the same time.\nThe Plan\nAs the initiative is still in its early stages, it\u2019s not yet set in stone what the potential block size decrease would look like, exactly. Even the desired limit isn\u2019t settled on, though it would most likely be brought down from the current theoretical maximum of almost four megabytes to a theoretical maximum of two or less. (This would, in reality, result in even smaller blocks; closer to one megabyte.) However, if this were to be achieved, the measure would be designed not to be permanent, so that an increase back to the current limit wouldn\u2019t be too difficult later on.\nThere are at least three rough ideas of how a block size decrease could be achieved.\nThe most notable proposal is a user-activated soft fork (UASF), similar to BIP148, the initiative to trigger SegWit activation in 2017. On the same date as two years ago, August 1, users would enforce the stricter rules for five months, incentivizing miners to comply. If a majority of miners (by hash power) go along, even non-upgraded users would remain compatible with the new rules; they\u2019d just see smaller blocks than previously allowed. A UASF is a risky strategy, however. If less than half of all miners go along, the blockchain could \u201csplit\u201d between upgraded and non-upgraded users.\nAlternatively, miners could impose a smaller block size limit themselves as a soft cap. Soft caps are non-binding limits that miners put on the blocks they mine and were used particularly throughout the first years of Bitcoin\u2019s existence. (Past soft caps were consecutively 250, 500 and 750 kilobytes, as recommended by Bitcoin developers.) This would be a much safer solution but would require that miners reject transactions and, thus, leave transaction fees on the table for each block they mine.\nAs a third option, proposed by Luke-jr, Bitcoin users could limit the size of blocks by making their transactions artificially \u201cheavy.\u201d Under Bitcoin\u2019s protocol rules, these transactions would be counted as if they were larger than they actually are, which means blocks would fill up faster with less actual transaction data. This change wouldn\u2019t require any protocol changes; wallets could offer it today. These transactions do, however, require individual users to choose to \u201coverpay\u201d on fees relative to regular transactions. (That\u2019s assuming miners act economically rationally and charge extra to include the heavy transactions.)\nBlock Size Debate Fatigue\nSome notable proponents of Luke-jr\u2019s initiative include Bitrefill CCO John Carvalho, Block Digest cohost Shinobi and JoinMarket developer Chris Belcher. Yet all of them would only want to go through with the effort if it gains broad backing. That also goes for Luke-jr himself: \u201cSoft forks like this need a lot of community support,\u201d he said.\nBut so far, support within the Bitcoin community appears to range from lukewarm (no pun intended) to skeptical to outright dismissive. Other than Luke-jr, no regular Bitcoin Core contributors have thrown their weight behind the proposal and no Bitcoin company of note has stated support; and while the proposal is generating a bit of buzz on social media and in chat rooms, a majority of commenters still seems to reject the idea.\nEven many of those who agree that a decrease would be a technical improvement in and of itself don\u2019t believe it would make too much of a difference. If blocks are smaller for several months or even several years, Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain size will still be large. Whether tomorrow\u2019s new users need to sync two days or three days may not be the deciding factor in whether to use a full node or not. Besides, there are other solutions that could make running a full node more attractive, some of which may well have much more effect. (Though, as Luke-jr points out, none of these solutions exclude also decreasing the block size limit.)\nWhat\u2019s more, years of in-fighting has made the Bitcoin community wary of commencing another block size battle and dealing with all the controversy that comes with it. After a long-fought \u201ccivil war,\u201d there appears to be little appetite to invest more time and energy in reviving the struggle on the same parameter \u2014 thereby, quite possibly, draining any momentum from the initiative even before it gets well underway.\nIndeed, even Luke-jr himself doubts he\u2019ll be the one carrying the initiative to the finish line this time.\n\u201cAlthough I may be the only one popularly pushing it \u2014 I don't have time to champion another BIP148, I fear,\u201d he said, noting how exhausting the previous UASF attempt was. \u201cI think the only way it will happen is if the community takes the lead on it.\u201d", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 15}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nDarknet markets are going as strong as ever, if Chainalysis data is to be believed.\nIn its latest Crypto Crime Report, published earlier this week, blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis reports that darknet market activity has nearly doubled throughout 2018. After a slump in late 2017 and early 2018 due to the closure of two major online marketplaces for illicit activity \u2014 AlphaBay and Hansa \u2014 volume has since almost completely recovered to early-2017\u2019s all-time high levels, surpassing $600 million worth of bitcoin for the year.\n\u201cLaw enforcement has been working hard to stop illicit activity on darknet markets, and there have been some notable successes like the closure of AlphaBay,\u201d the report notes. \u201cOverall, these markets continue to thrive, however, as participants simply move their business to other platforms and technologies.\u201d\nWhack-A-Mole\nDarknet markets, the online market places for illicit goods and services that operate on hidden services and use bitcoin (and sometimes altcoins like litecoin and monero) for payments, have been around in their current form since 2011, when Ross Ulbricht founded Silk Road.\nAlthough this pioneering darknet market was shut down by law enforcement in 2013, others have since taken its place. What\u2019s more, the size and volume of these markets have only grown over the years. According to Chainalysis data, trading volume at identified darknet markets was over $700 million dollars worth in 2017 \u2014 where Silk Road never accounted for more than $200 million a year.\n\nThe Silk Road\u2019s biggest and best-known successor, other than Silk Road 2.0, may have been AlphaBay, with Hansa following closely behind. In the summer of 2017, both AlphaBay and Hansa joined in Silk Road\u2019s fate, however, and were closed down by law enforcement. Silk Road 2.0 had already been shut down in 2014.\nYet, once again, in the greater scheme of countering darknet markets, this only proved to be a stop-gap solution. In what Chainalysis describes as \u201cplaying whack-a-mole with darknet markets,\u201d alternative and new platforms took the place of the old, and after an initial drop, overall trading volume rebounded as well. Throughout 2018, this totaled over $600 million, Chainalysis estimates, with more than $2 million a day toward the end of the year.\n\u201cDarknet market activity has been remarkably resilient over the last few years, despite continued efforts by law enforcement to shut down illicit activities,\u201d Chainalysis writes in its report. \u201cWhen one darknet market closes, others pop up to take its place.\u201d\nChainalysis points to the Russian-language Hydra as one of the main successors of AlphaBay, which has doubled its activity since the latter was closed in 2017. Other major darknet markets that are active today include Dream Market and Wall Street Market.\nBitcoin and Darknet Markets\nWhile bitcoin is still the currency of choice on most darknet markets, Chainalysis does believe that this type of activity has come to constitute a much smaller share of total bitcoin usage over time. While up to 7 percent of transacted bitcoin value in 2012 and 2013 \u2014 the peak of the Silk Road \u2014 was related to darknet markets, this is now well below 1 percent, Chainalysis estimates.\nThe blockchain data analytics firm also found that the bitcoin price has little effect on its use for these kinds of illicit activities.\n\u201cDarknet market activity is relatively price inelastic; that is, you don\u2019t see a drop in this type of activity when cryptocurrency prices fall. In fact, in 2018, when Bitcoin volumes dropped by 78%, darknet market activity nearly doubled,\u201d the report notes.\nThis inelasticity is in large part because users of these markets often merely use bitcoin as a vehicle to move value around \u2014 not for speculative purposes. Consumers buy bitcoin with fiat currency on one end of the trade, and dealers sell the bitcoin for fiat currency on the other. Indeed, Chainalysis found that more funds were flowing to darknet markets toward the end of the week (as buyers move to purchase goods), while dealers generally move their bitcoin out on Mondays to cash in their proceeds.\n\nFinally, Chainalysis describes how, as law enforcement is getting better at shutting down darknet markets, a new and potentially even more resilient model for darknet market activity is emerging. Moving away from centralized platforms, the analytics firm reports that an increasing amount of trading is taking place on encrypted messaging apps.\n\u201cTop law enforcement officials tell us that criminals are migrating increasingly to encrypted messaging apps including Telegram and WhatsApp to execute illegal transactions. When conducted through these apps, transaction activity is decentralized and person-to-person; there\u2019s little risk that law enforcement will shut down the entire network by closing a website,\u201d the report reads.\nYou can download the Chainalysis report here.", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 31}

Last October, Fidelity announced the creation of a platform for institutional traders to invest in cryptocurrencies, using over-the-counter trading and cold storage to ensure the security of the various assets.\nAs the first quarter of the 2019 fiscal year is well underway, Fidelity is making moves to turn this proposal into reality. These sources claim that bitcoin will naturally be the first crypto asset offered on the platform, though \u201cether custody is expected to be next.\u201d\nFidelity did comment directly on the imminent plans for this custody service, although they made no guarantees of the projected launch date. \u201cWe are currently serving a select set of eligible clients as we continue to build our initial solutions,\u201d they said. \u201cOver the next several months, we will thoughtfully engage with and prioritize prospective clients based on needs, jurisdiction and other factors.\u201d\nCustody is a commonplace service in the world of markets but is significantly less common in the crypto asset investment space at the institutional level. Relying on third-party actors to protect securities from the risk of theft or fraud, most crypto custody takes place within the realm of startups. With the recent announcement that New York state will condone crypto custody, however, many financial banks are looking to get in on the action.\nAn institutional custody service from a titanic asset manager like Fidelity, which deals with trillions of dollars of properties, could give a boost to bitcoin\u2019s slow progress with Wall Street.", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 30}

The filing has all the bureaucratic trappings of those that came before, but it will reset the clock on the SEC\u2019s decision-making time frame for the institutional-grade product.\nSince its introduction to the industry in 2013, the bitcoin ETF has been praised as the key to unlocking Wall Street\u2019s formal access to bitcoin\u2019s market, and, by proxy, the key to flushing fresh capital into the market to send it to new heights. A role call of rejections, delays or reviews has punctuated each effort, though, and a handful of outstanding applications (which are pending review by the commission) were, until now, the remaining contenders in Bitcoin\u2019s multi-year wrestling match with the SEC.\nThis refiling has Cboe, VanEck and SolidX reentering the ring after the joint venture retracted a long-standing filing last week amidst the U.S. government\u2019s multi-month shutdown. Jan van Eck, VanEck\u2019s CEO, feared the obstruction might jeopardized the filings chance at approval, as regular talks with SEC personnel ceased when the shutdown took effect. Rather than take the risk that the ETF might get tossed aside, the venture opted to withdraw its proposal.\nWith the government now reopened, the trio is trying again (for VanEck and SolidX, this will be the fourth filing between the participants). Once the SEC lists the proposed rule change on the Federal Registry, the SEC will have 240 days to make a decision (for those of use keeping track, no later than October).\n\u201cWe are actively working with regulators and major market participants to build appropriate market structure frameworks for a Bitcoin ETF and digital assets in general.

The market now finds itself cruising toward prior lows. On expanding volume and spread, the bitcoin market appears ripe for a continuation of the downtrend:\n\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Broken Support\nAlthough the current daily candle has yet to close, unless there is a strong influx of demand hitting the market, it stands to reason that bitcoin will be closing a new daily low for the first time since mid-December. Following the stopping action in the low $3,000s, the bitcoin market remained coiled for over a month. However, today marks the first break of these levels once marked as support. To illustrate how coiled the market was and how potentially large the following move could be, check out the 3-Day Bollinger Bands (bbands):\n\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 3-Day Candles, Bollinger Bands\nThe figure above shows a very tightly wound, consolidated market \u2014 a market that previously took several months to consolidate. In just over two months, bitcoin has found itself prepped for another potentially large move. The first logical pitstop on its move is the retest of the prior low in the low $3,000 area. As we move up in timeframes, the weekly candles are showing a zone of support between $3,000 and $3,150:\n\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, Weekly Candles, Next Macro Support Level\nThe $3,000 level is one of the few established levels that has proven to hold up during a support retest. And, since we have already seen major, climactic volume from the last major sell-off to $3,100, it seems logical that we\u2019ll get a slightly deeper test of the $3,000 values.\nFrom there, we will have to reassess and see how the macro view looks if we can manage a retest of that support zone. A weekly close below that level is a decisively bearish move so we will have to keep an eye out for where the weekly candles close. It\u2019s entirely possible that this level will hold up well under a test given how much buyer interest there was last time around. But for now, we will have to play it candle by candle and see how the bulls react to a retest of the low.\nSummary:\nBitcoin finally broke its multi-week support level.The break came about on expanding volume and price spread. Expanding volume and spread coupled with a major support break is a sign of bullish exhaustion and will likely lead to a test of deeper support.There is a major support level just below a current low in the $3,000 area. There will likely be buyer interest in this zone, but we will have to measure the response to a test of deeper lows as the market presents itself.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Organized by the Bitcoin Foundation, it was centered on Bitcoin specifically and the more pragmatic issues that Bitcoin was trying to solve, particularly in the areas of Bitcoin technology, Bitcoin mining, Bitcoin business and regulatory issues.\nWriting for Bitcoin Magazine at the time, Vitalik Buterin commented, \u201cFor long-time Bitcoin users, events like this are particularly emotional; here, for the first time, we are able to see fellow Bitcoin users, whom we have loved, worked with and had heated arguments with over forums or Skype/IRC chat for many months or years as something more than just a username. Entire companies, existing only \u2018on the cloud\u2019 before this day, are finally reunited.\u201d\nThis summer, billed as \u201cA Peer-to-Peer Conference,\u201d Bitcoin 2019 will be held at SVN West in San Francisco, California, hosted by BTC Inc, from June 25\u201326, 2019. In a blog post announcing the event, BTC Inc CEO David Bailey noted that Bitcoin 2019 was so named to harken back to that earlier conference \u201cwhen the Bitcoin community was unified and nerds filled the hotel lobby until the early morning while dreaming of what Bitcoin could become.\u201d\nThe Bitcoin community has grown considerably since 2013, and it has experienced its share of growing pains along the way. People who are passionate about the technology have had differing viewpoints about its direction. As a result, even as Bitcoin has matured and the blockchain ecosystem has evolved, the community itself has become somewhat fractured.\nBailey sees Bitcoin 2019 as an opportunity to help rekindle the \u201csense of shared wonder and spontaneous commitment to realizing Bitcoin\u2019s potential,\u201d as it was back in 2013.\n\u201cWe want to be able to provide a platform that brings together leaders in the Bitcoin community, along with creators, developers, newbies and enthusiasts, in order to allow for new ideas to freely flow among the people who care most about building the Bitcoin of the future,\u201d Bailey told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\u201cWe want to help drive the conversation beyond simply scaling Bitcoin. We want to showcase what\u2019s possible to build with Bitcoin, without breaking BTC\u2019s consensus rules, which are rigid.\u201d\nAttracting and Supporting New Growth in Bitcoin\nBailey\u2019s hope is that this event will bring together people from across Bitcoin\u2019s ideological and political spectrum. He is quick to point out that this is not a \u201cBitcoin Maximalist\u201d or an \u201canti-any-other-crypto-or-fork\u201d event; however, it is unmistakably a Bitcoin/BTC conference.\n\u201cWe\u2019re working hard to help curate the content of the conference so that people who aim to be unifying with fresh ideas and cool projects built on Bitcoin are able to have their voices heard,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to argue how big a block needs to be or what Satoshi\u2019s original vision was \u2014 that debate has already happened. BTC is BTC. Everything else is not BTC, and this is an event for BTC.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cWe are coming at this from the perspective that this is a Bitcoin BTC event, but it\u2019s not \u2018anti-other-crypto.\u2019 Regardless of what other projects people have worked on or supported, we want people to not feel excluded from Bitcoin. Just check everything else at the door and come build Bitcoin with us \u2026 at least for a couple of days at the conference.\u201d\nTo that end, Bitcoin 2019 has reached out to a wide array of industry leaders and developers to participate in the event. Among the preliminary list of speakers are Bill Barhydt, Matt Corallo, Diego Gutierrez, Dan Held, Jimmy Song, Erik Voorhees, Jihan Wu and Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s own Aaron van Wirdum. More speakers will be announced in the near future.\n\u201cThis is not a pay-to-play event,\u201d Bailey emphasizes. \u201cThe easy part is finding the showcase-worthy projects. We actively seek out and learn about the cool things that are going on. We talk to people all over the world constantly about their new projects they\u2019re working on. The hard part will be deciding which ones we will be able to carve out time for at the conference.\u201d\nAnyone interested in participating in Bitcoin 2019 as a speaker, panelist or presenter is encouraged to contact the organizers.\nIn order to make the conference accessible to the greatest number of people possible, tickets will initially be priced at $100. There is also a virtual hackathon \u201cfor ideas built atop and around Bitcoin and the Lightning Network\u201d associated with the event in the works.\nBitcoin 2019 is powered by Bitcoin Magazine and produced by BTC Inc.\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 30}

This is made possible through its integration with payment processor Simplex, according to a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine.\nThe credit card option has a daily limit of $20,000 per user and $50,000 monthly limit per user. For every transaction that goes through the Simplex gateway, a user will be charged 3.5 percent of the transaction or a $10 flat fee, whichever is higher.\nUsers won\u2019t be able to trade the fiat directly with other traders. Instead, they must go through Binance to exchange their fiat directly for bitcoin, ether, litecoin and xrp.\nBinance is the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume according to CoinMarketCap, accounting for over $650 million in trades every day. Before now, traders had to purchase bitcoin or a slew of other altcoins on another platform before transferring it to Binance for trading. With the new credit card integration, the idea is to have traders pay for any crypto of their choice with ease.\n\u201cThe crypto industry is still in its early stages, and most of the world\u2019s money is still in fiat. Building fiat gateways are what we need now to grow the ecosystem, increase adoption and introduce crypto to more users,\u201d Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao remarked in the press release.\nNimrod Lehavi, co-founder and CEO of Simplex, also commented on the partnership, arguing that fast credit card payments are \u201ca key factor in wider adoption of crypto in general.\u201d\nThe service works in the U.S. except for six states, including New York and Washington State.

Find out what happened to him earlier on Day 1 , on Day 2 , on Day 3 , onDay 4, on Day 5 and on Day 6.\nI woke to the sound of thin but consistent rain against the sailboat. A gentle storm soon rolled in to softly rock the harbor\u2019s rustbucket bedfellows, a few spurts of lightning distant and crackling across the bay.\nDustin wasn\u2019t up yet so I made a cup of coffee (gods be praised) and went above the deck of the Velela \u2014 the name Dustin\u2019s sailboat came with when he bought it four years ago. The previous owner (a marine biologist) was inspired by the jellyfish of the same name, which can hoist a sail-like fin in the air to propel itself more quickly through the water.\n\nThe Velela resting in the harbor.\nAfter Dustin got up (and we wolfed down some bacon-n-egg burritos), we made preparations, which included stuffing a rubber skiff into his Honda Fit, and we set out on the open water. The day was graying as we left the docking area, with a misting of rain so faint you could barely feel it on your skin.\nOnce we\u2019d motored out far enough, Dustin hoisted the sails. Swelling with the bay\u2019s untamable winds, the sails vaulted us forward and leaned the boat over to the right \u2014 a bit more than I would have liked.\n\u201cThis is safe, right? It\u2019s not going to tip over?\u201d I asked apprehensively.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t exactly call sailing a safe activity,\u201d Dustin said with a smile that managed to be both carefree and severe.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not going to tip over, is it?\u201d\n\u201cProbably not,\u201d he joked. \u201cBut really, there\u2019s a huge weight in the middle of the hull, so we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\nWe were headed for the city\u2019s waterfront, a 10-mile trek, give or take. The wind was against us, though, so we had to get there by tacking, a maritime navigation technique that involves sailing diagonally with the wind and cutting an angle to switch back toward your destination (basically making a zigzag pattern).\n\nRoughly 10 miles out from San Francisco, the city\u2019s skyline faintly visible to the right.\nDustin pulled out what he called the autohelm, a smart tablet (even the boats in Silicon Valley have iPads) that keeps track of speed, depth, GPS, trajectory and supposedly can even steer the ship using this USB-plunger attachment on the wheel, which looks uncannily like the suction sections of those automatic pumps for milking cows.\nHe put it to work, the mechanic whir and churn of the plunger struggling to keep the boat on course as the weather worsened. I had the feeling that, under better conditions, the autohelm would have performed admirably.\nThe heavy force of the wind and waves, though, eventually overpowered the automaton\u2019s control over the boat. Dustin \u201cfired\u201d it and took the wheel.\nLooking out to my right, I noticed a blackened cloud, dark and gnarly, billowing up, the kind that looks ready to dump at any moment. The rain was falling a bit more steadily (though not too heavily), and the wind was picking up, causing the waves to chop savagely away at the haul.\nBefore I could convey my concerns, Mother Nature decided to blow them into the open. A gust of wind bruised the sails and sent the ship tipping and the boat's contents flying below deck. The vessel was at an angle when the clatter of Dustin\u2019s belongings became audible as they were flung about in the cabin.\nShould have kept that skiff at hand. And now that I think about it, where are the life vests?\n\u201cLet out that line!\u201d Dustin commanded, taking on the urgent persona of a captain as he strained to turn the boat against the lean. \u201cAs much as you can!\u201d\nI released a line connected to the bow\u2019s sail and it went slack. Dustin rushed to the midsection while I took over the wheel and he let down the mainsail, finally disarming the wind. The entire ordeal, which felt like it took some time, probably lasted a minute at most.\n\u201cI think we should turn back,\u201d I observed brilliantly.\n\u201cYou think so?\u201d he said with a heave of nervous laughter.\nWe got back (thankfully) right before the boat\u2019s motor died, but we were still eight spots away from Dustin\u2019s space in the dock. With the help of two good samaritans, we towed the sailboat back to its place with painstaking attentiveness. Dustin didn\u2019t relax until she was safely moored.\n\u201cWhew! I\u2019m still up on adrenaline!\u201d he hollered when the boat was docked\nMost people get stressed into a knot when their car battery dies. Imagine that happening except it\u2019s a boat in open water and it almost capsizes. Oh, and the boat is also your house.\n\n\n\nI said goodbye to Dustin over another burrito and sent him some sats for the trouble. After we parted ways, I grabbed a Lyft and headed just south of the Tenderloin district to cryptografitti\u2019s place.\nThe apartment is on brand for an artist. Sterile, with neutral tones of chrome and white across each room, the flat was extremely well kept. Art of various styles decorates the place: a postmodern painting detailing San Franciscan life, which he had commissioned by a local artist, hangs above a tannish-brown, leather sectional; a puzzle-piece coffee table to accompany the couch; and a metal-matted two-piece fixture in the kitchen with a surface that looks like cells under a microscope that his sister made for him.\nAnd, of course, his own art is on display in his studio.\nOne original, United Nodes x 100, hangs directly behind his work desk, while two variants of Currency Exchange lie in the back-left corner and on the desk. Next to the one on the desk is one of his latest: the abstract of the Bitcoin white paper made from USD.\nThe rest of his office is lined with shelves that are stuffed with various supplies, including the white gloves he wears in each of his videos. On one of the shelves, a bag of hundreds of credit cards for a piece he made to commemorate the late Hal Finney. I was curious as to how he got his hands on that many cancelled credit cards.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a trade secret. They\u2019re all used,\u201d he said. (You can buy them on eBay, by the way).\nWe talked art, bitcoin culture and the experiment in a conversation that seemed to intertwine all these topics together.\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s all about teaching people about bitcoin through art. I wanted to anchor the work in something that people were already familiar,\u201d he said.\nHe\u2019s certainly made an impact. The former DJ subsists off the money he makes from his art, and he takes regular commissions, mainly from wealthy, fellow enthusiasts who want an original of the subversive fusion of fiat and digital economies that cryptografitti\u2019s art represents.\n\u201cI want to remind people that the materials I use in the work are short-lived and, therefore, so is the entire status quo. And if the old monetary realm is no longer, what should the new one look like and why?\u201d\nCarrying on the conversation we had the night before at Stookey\u2019s, he said again that it\u2019s not all that surprising fewer merchants accept bitcoin now. The party\u2019s over and everyone\u2019s gone home. The people who were just there for the good times left with the bull market; but, in the bear, the people who really give a damn are sticking around to deal with the aftermath.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like when you have a party and your good friends stick around afterward to help clean up after the revelers have left. Go to Bitcoin meetups nowadays and you\u2019ll find the people that care and are willing to put in the work,\u201d he said.\nHe doesn\u2019t think enthusiasm is dead, it\u2019s just dampened and embodied in a very dedicated core community.\n\u201cThe excitement is still there, it\u2019s just shifted focus to Lightning,\u201d he said. It\u2019s likely that Lighting is the very thing that may make my experiment easier, if I choose to do it again in the (distant) future.\nBlack Swan, one of his latest pieces, exemplifies this excitement. The Lightning Network-only auction had 100 plus participants and sold to the lowest bidder \u2014 less than 1/100th of a penny. Part-performance, part-visual art, cryptograffiti said he wanted the piece to provoke people to appreciate innovation without fretting about price.\n\u201cMy work is rooted in activism. When I can motivate people to get involved, it brings more awareness to whatever I am trying to convey. In this case, a lowest-bidder-wins auction was my way of ensuring participation/reach in the project while highlighting the capabilities of the lightning network.\n\u201cThe fancified promo video that accompanied the art was meant to contrast with the absurdly low micropayments and poke fun at MSM who tend to focus more on price than the groundbreaking tech being built,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nCatching a few hours of R&R after my visit with cryptografitti, I still had one thing to do before I could call the week quits. I couldn\u2019t get a room at 20 Mission due to San Francisco boarding codes, but I was still game to visit the hacker community house that Kashmir Hill shacked up in during the weekend of her week on bitcoin. I had made arrangements with Berkeley, the community\u2019s head honcho, to visit that night.\nThe Uber that took me there was yet another Prius, the fifth (maybe sixth) I\u2019ve ridden in this week.\nI buzzed myself in with the house\u2019s callbox, entered the foyer and made my way upstairs to a labyrinth of hallways and rooms (the community houses 40 or so people).\nA resident came in shortly after, toting an LED-glowing electric unicycle that had an extended handle like a rolling suitcase. I asked him if he knew where Berkeley was, and he pointed me in the right direction.\nWe made introductions and Berkeley offered me a La Croix, another in a set of San Franciscan constants that include whole bean coffee, 20-somethings ripping Juuls, and Uber rides in Priuses.\nBerkeley actually helped Jered Kenna, the cofounder and now owner of 20 Mission, found Tradehill, a once-upon-a-time bitcoin exchange that accounted for 15 percent of the coin\u2019s daily trading volume back in the day when Mt. Gox accounted for 80 percent.\nHe reiterated some of what Hill talks about in her piece: how 20 Mission was much worse for wear before Kenna first cleaned it up.\n\u201cBefore that it was basically a seedy crack hotel. Squatters lived there, but it was abandoned for something like 18 years,\u201d said Berkeley.\nAs we talked, we walked around the house and I surveyed the murals that decorated each hallway. Local artists had done them, including the ones that enliven the house\u2019s glorified courtyard: an open-air space in the middle of the building that\u2019s accessible only through windows and is floored with roofing tiles.\n\nOne of the house\u2019s many murals.\nAt the corners of some of the hallways, street signs with titles like \u201cLitecoin Lane,\u201d \u201cEthereum Blvd.\u201d and \u2014 thank God \u2014 \u201cCoinye West.\u201d\nThe signs made me wonder if the house has an active crypto and general tech community, seeing as it\u2019s billed as a hacker community. They still accept bitcoin for room and board, but the house\u2019s tech focus shouldn\u2019t be overstated, Berkeley told me.\n\u201cWe have some people working on crypto, but it\u2019s not like everyone is in crypto. For example, we just had a guy here who is a doctor, so it\u2019s a mix.\u201d\nDoctors, lawyers, professors, service workers, developers \u2014 folks of all kind live in the community.\n\u201cWith 40 rooms, there are lots of different people. We\u2019re decentralized.\u201d\nUnfortunately, none of the crypto-focused professionals were around to chat, either by virtue of being busy or because they were hiding from \u201cthe media.\u201d That was all right by me; I understand their need for privacy, and given America\u2019s current media climate and public sentiment, I didn\u2019t find it shocking that they didn\u2019t want to show their faces to a nosy reporter (the industry\u2019s professionals seem to approach the press with serious skepticism).\nSatisfied with the tour and the talk, I thanked Berkley and went on my way.\nBack at the castle, I had a last supper from Curry Up Now (courtesy, as always, of Bitrefill-funded Uber Eats), relaxed and, just like that, the week was over.\nI went to bed thankful I\u2019d be able to use my fiat debit card in the morning.\n\n\nAs Kashmir Hill did in her original journey, Colin is accepting BTC tips to help him along the way.\nTip jar: 3CnLhqitCjUN4HPYf6Qa2MmvCpSoBiFfBN\nColin is an associate editor and staff writer for Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0 He's proud to call Nashville his home, where he lives with his family and doesn't eat hot chicken as much as you might think.\u00a0\n", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 28}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nTwo \u201cprominent professional hacking groups\u201d are responsible for the majority of publicly reported hacks of cryptocurrency exchanges and other cryptocurrency organizations, concludes a report published by blockchain data analytics firm Chainalysis this week. According to the report, simply called the Crypto Crime Report, the groups generated around $1 billion of hacking revenues for themselves so far.\n\u201cHacking dwarfs all other forms of crypto crime, and it is dominated by two prominent, professional hacking groups,\u201d the report states. \u201cTogether, these two groups are responsible for stealing around $1 billion to date, at least 60% of all publicly reported hacks.\u201d\nHacks\nExchanges, wallet providers and other custodial services have been prime targets for cybercriminals for years. From the MyBicoin theft and Bitcoinica hacks in Bitcoin\u2019s early days, to the infamous Mt. Gox collapse due to stolen funds and the Bitstamp and Bitfinex hacks more recently, to the Cryptopia theft just several weeks ago, hacks and thefts are a recurring theme in the cryptocurrency space.\nNow, Chainalysis\u2019 report suggests that many of the same people may be responsible for most of these kinds of hacks. By tracing the movement of funds on from hack to exit point (the exchange where funds were ultimately converted into fiat currency), Chainalysis believes it has been able to pinpoint two prominent hacking groups. Dubbed \u201cAlpha\u201d and \u201cBeta\u201d by the blockchain analytics firm, these two groups, together, would have been responsible for about 60 percent of publicly reported hacks, worth a total of $1 billion, with an average of $90 million per hack.\nFurthermore, the Chainalysis report notes that both Alpha and Beta went through lengths to shuffle the coins they stole, seemingly in an attempt to obfuscate the source of the funds. This mostly involved a huge amount of transactions moving the stolen funds from address to address, the report notes: \u201cThe hackers typically move stolen funds through a complex array of wallets and exchanges in an attempt to disguise the funds\u2019 criminal origins. On average, the hackers move funds at least 5,000 times.\u201d\nThis shuffling was combined with periods of inactivity, presumably to wait until interest in the hacks would die down before converting the cryptocurrency proceeds into fiat currency.\nMotives\nInterestingly, Chainalysis did find that Alpha and Beta are shuffling their loot around using different, independently distinguishable strategies. The blockchain data analytics firm even believes this reveals something about the nature and intent of the two groups.\n\u201c[W]e suspect that [\u2026] Alpha, is a giant, tightly controlled organization partly driven by nonmonetary goals,\u201d writes Chainalysis. \u201cThey appear as eager to create havoc as to maximize profits. Alpha seems much more sophisticated, expertly shuffling funds around in a way that suggests they want to avoid detection.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Beta \u2014 the smaller of the two \u2014 appears less organized, less skilled at moving the funds around, and more focused on the money itself, according to the report: \u201cThey don\u2019t appear to care very much about evading detection, just about getting a clear route to convert illicit assets to clean cash.\u201d In one case, Beta is said to have cashed out more than $32 million in one go.\nBoth groups have been successful in funneling much of their proceeds to exchange it for fiat currency, Chainalysis writes, as more than half of all the hacked funds were converted in less than four months, and about three quarters of the hacked funds were cashed out within six months. This was largely done by using regular exchanges, according to the report, which Chainalysis believes was possible because \u201cexchanges and law enforcement have had limited ability to track hacked funds.\u201d\nThe report does not detail which hacks were analyzed, where the proceeds were cashed out, or any more identifying information about the Alpha or Beta groups. Chainalysis did not respond to inquiries by Bitcoin Magazine before time of publication.\nYou can download the Chainalysis report here.", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 1}

As Palestine is not internationally recognized as a country, Hamas\u2019 militant arm frequently clashes with Israeli forces.\nJust recently, spokesmen for the group made an appeal on Telegram, requesting for bitcoin and publishing a Coinbase address.\n\u201cThe Zionist enemy is fighting the resistance by trying to cut its support by all means,\u201d the request claims, asking \u201call supporters of the resistance and of our just cause to support it through Bitcoin, through means that we will announce soon.\u201d\nSoon after this announcement, Israeli crypto startup Whitestream reportedly began detecting transfers of bitcoin to this wallet address. It is uncertain whether or not Coinbase will block the account associated with the transfers, lest it fall afoul of international anti-terror laws.\nIn late January 2019, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu blocked a multimillion dollar aid package to the Gaza Strip, under the pretext that this money would be used \u201cto pay salaries of Hamas civil servants.\u201d In light of this development, it seems as if Hamas is looking toward more untraceable funding mechanisms.\nThe cryptocurrency space is, by this point, no stranger to use cases that involve illicit activity. The Silk Road, for example, made huge steps toward making bitcoin a household name through the widespread smuggling of illegal drugs. Given the borderless and flexible online utility of cryptocurrencies, it makes sense that terrorists and militants are starting to consider the potential of an untraceable currency to fund operations, a trend that appears to be growing.\nGovernments have long been wary of cryptocurrency terrorist funding, and a handful of bills have circulated through the U.S. Congress that would strive to police and stanch this activity.", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 4}
{"title": "Living on Bitcoin for a Week in San Francisco", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/living-bitcoin-week-san-francisco/", "birthday": "Feb 4, 2019 3:02 PM EST", "date": "2019-02-04 20:02:00", "content": "When I decided, maybe against my better judgement, to live on bitcoin for a week, the plan was met by a combination of cautions and jokes from friends and loved ones: \u201cJust don\u2019t starve,\u201d \u201cWell, it\u2019s the New Year, a perfect time to start a new diet,\u201d \u201cWill you be able to eat?\u201d, \u201cHave you really thought about it?\u201d\nI had \u201creally\u201d thought about it and it seemed not only sensible but necessary. Nakamoto\u2019s white paper calls Bitcoin an \u201cElectronic Cash System,\u201d and I hadn\u2019t stressed the cryptocurrency\u2019s utility as an actual method of payment.\nMy experiment would likely validate the strong opinions of skeptics (to whom bitcoin is either some nebulous scam at its worst or an outrageously valued trinket for prodigal hobbyists at its best) and that camp of maximalists who believe that bitcoin isn\u2019t and never was digital cash.\nIt\u2019s a problem that Kashmir Hill ran into when she did her own experiments, more so in 2013 than 2014. In 2013, her final conclusion was that she had \u201csurvived\u201d the week, but by 2014, she had herself a ball spending bitcoin. She went from conquering San Francisco\u2019s hilly landscape on foot and bike in 2013 (and the occasional, simple pleasure of pizza and cupcakes) to the luxury of Uber rides, wine tours and even a strip club visit just a year later.\nShe did well for herself the second go at it. I want to be able to do even better.\nThat as my mindset going into my own version of the experiment, picking up five years later from where Hill had left off. If she survived on her first attempt, then I damn well ought to be able to thrive, I thought, going into it.\nBoy, was I dead wrong.\nA day or two in was all it would take to break this expectation as I soon learned that my experience would be unlike either of Hill\u2019s. I anticipated great merchant adoption and with it a greater variety of services through which to use my bitcoin. I thought I was walking into a more vibrant Bitcoin scene than half a decade ago, an opportunity rich with ways I could offload my coin.\nInstead, I found (at least in San Francisco) that fewer merchants take bitcoin now than they did before and that the Bay area\u2019s Bitcoin community, excepting those still active in it, had receded into altcoin enthusiasm and the flowering industry of \u201cblockchain not Bitcoin\u201d that had become the new darling of tech VCs and entrepreneurs.\nThose still involved in the community took care of me though, and the week was just as easy or as difficult as I wanted to make it.\n\n\n\nLiving on Bitcoin Day 1: \u201cThat\u2019s Not Going to Work\u201d\nI set out to live on bitcoin for a week in San Francisco.\nLiving On Bitcoin Day 2: Being \u201cUnbanked\u201d Has Been Easy \u2026 But Also Hard\nOn Day 2 of living on bitcoin experiment in San Francisco, I go on the hunt for some bitcoin-friendly eateries.\nLiving on Bitcoin Day 3: Brother, Can You Take a Sat?\nI desperately comb the streets of San Francisco, hoping to find someone \u2014 anyone \u2014 who will accept payment in bitcoin on Day 3 of my experiment.\nLiving on Bitcoin Day 4: The Uphill Climb\nLiving on bitcoin has been a bit of an uphill battle. On Day 4, I try out some gift card options and move into the Crypto Castle.\nLiving on Bitcoin Day 5: An In-Store Buy At Last (Spoiler: It\u2019s Pot-Related)\nI finally make a point-of-sale purchase with bitcoin, hunt for Coinbase\u2019s headquarters and chat with a young entrepreneur.\nLiving on Bitcoin Day 6: An Artist, a Dev and a Moon Boy Walk Into a Bar\u2026\nI continue my San Francisco experiment, spending bitcoin and attending a meetup in a crypto-friendly bar with some great, diverse company.\nLiving on Bitcoin Day 7: A Supposedly Fun Thing I\u2019d Definitely Do Again\nI finally wrap up my week of living on bitcoin in San Francisco with visits to 20 Mission and bitcoin artist cryptograffiti. But first, I\u2019ll have to survive a storm out on the Bay.\n\n\n\nSaying that I thrived while on bitcoin would be pushing it, but saying that I survived would be an embellishment.\nSo I\u2019ll put it another way: I subsisted. Plain and simple, I got by without buying into a strip club\u2019s tit-for-tat (tit-for-bit?) or splurging on a high-dollar meal like Kashmir Hill did in 2014 (though I could do that here in Nashville, dropping fat sats for a meal at Flyte). Sure, the drinks at Stookey\u2019s weren\u2019t cheap, but they weren\u2019t a bottle of Dom either. I got by without even buying a meal from a merchant during my trip, relying on bitcoin-bought Uber Eats credit and friends to keep me fed.\nMy experience was both anticlimactic and blindsiding. I could have done it anywhere, something that I describe in the write-ups as fascinating and frustrating at the same time. I didn\u2019t need San Francisco to spend my bitcoin (a city that, the week made quite clear, didn\u2019t really want my bitcoin). Bitcoin didn\u2019t need the merchants, though, to be useful; infrastructure, like Paxful and Bitrefill, made it useful.\nAs the series unfolded on social media, plenty of other bitcoin-to-gift-card services, like Fold App and Bidali, reached out to me on Twitter, reaching for a chance at a PR plug (don\u2019t get me wrong, though \u2014 I respect the hustle). I used what I knew going into the experiment, though out of the three exchanges that I demoed (Paxful, Bitrefill and Gyft), I stuck with Bitrefill for its convenience and efficiency.\nI probably should have tried some of the other options, and I fully support any company building this infrastructure because, without it, the experiment would have been over by day two (or I would have had to swallow the probability of a seven-day fast as I wrestled with how much I cared about my journalistic integrity).\nSo I learned that this experiment is either too easy or too impossible, depending on how you frame it. What else I learned (in a strictly Silicon Valley context):\nThe general public\u2019s enthusiasm for Bitcoin has been dampened with the market.Interest in altcoins and blockchain has, in part, replaced this enthusiasm.Because of this interest, there\u2019s at least one place (The Boba Tea Shop) that accepts a motley of altcoins but not bitcoin.Fewer places accept bitcoin now than in 2013\u20132014.Places stopped accepting bitcoin either because their payment processors went under or because transaction times and fees were outrageous during the peak of the 2017 bull run.Transaction times were pretty quick and fees weren\u2019t high (none of my transactions took over a minute the whole week unless I opted for a low fee).Even if merchant adoption has waned, infrastructure using bitcoin to leverage services (e.g., Bitrefill, Paxful, etc. for buying gift cards) has progressed.Bitcoin ATMs aren\u2019t as cool as they sound.Merchants who don\u2019t accept bitcoin will either be annoyed/amused/confused when you ask if they do.An unfortunate number of places that used to accept bitcoin don\u2019t exist anymore.You still can\u2019t buy coffee with bitcoin (unless you buy a gift card first).Pretty much all resources for locating bitcoin-accepting venues (like coinmap.org or Edge wallet\u2019s merchant finder) are outdated.Mobile wallets are still too clunky and unreliable for mass adoption.You don\u2019t need a payment processor to do a point of sale and I wish businesses would understand this.Bitcoin OGs are still around.If you decide to live on bitcoin for a week, they will help you out.You could get hammered on bitcoin in San Francisco with liquor-by-the-drink (or bottle).Bitcoin is (obviously) best as a store of value.Because of this, it has its faults as a payment method, but the community is aware of these faults.Coinbase has become a monolithic entity that is hard to penetrate.This experiment is not all-encompassing and would play out much differently elsewhere.\nThat last point might be a bit foolhardy to make before I actually try it, but I was told on day one by a Czech booth exhibitor that Prague would be a breeze. Aaron van Wirdum corroborated this claim, adding that his home in the Netherlands (specifically Amsterdam and Rotterdam) would be a great testing ground for the experiment. Jared Harrell, a community manager at Quantstamp and Canadian native, told me Vancouver would be worth visiting while pouring praise on the Canadian bitcoin community\u2019s constitution and significance (my editor, another proud bitcoin Canuck, has also implored me to have a go at it in Canada).\nI\u2019ll get there eventually (I hope). I intend to replicate this science experiment to get a larger sample size, and I have a hunch that I\u2019ll get different results in different jurisdictions. For now, New York, Canada (Quebec/Ontario), Czech Republic (Prague), Netherlands (Rotterdam/Amsterdam) and the U.K. (London) are on my list of test subjects, and, for the new experiments, I\u2019ll attempt a heightened level of difficulty for the variables (including not using Bitrefill, Paxful, Gyft, etc.).\nLatin America is another place that comes to mind, probably the place that best exemplifies why this experiment is worthwhile. As the economic and political situations in Venezuela worsen, bitcoin\u2019s relevance in the region is on prominent display, and its utility is infecting neighboring countries as a diaspora of Venezuelan refugees pours across the economically battered country\u2019s borders.\nAt the end of my experiment, I had the privileges of eschewing my bitcoin wallet in favor of my real one and I was elated to get to use cash (whether physical or digital) again. For those (and they\u2019re out there) living unbanked or under the duress of a faltering monetary system, the experiment never ends \u2014 it\u2019s a struggle they reckon with daily.\nSo I also learned that, over the course of the week, I didn\u2019t need to live on bitcoin, so the choice to was gratuitous and a bit opportunistic (it gave me something fabulous to write about and has supplied my cocktail-party-conversation reserves with endless new material). But I also learned that, if I needed to, I could live on bitcoin, just as a growing population of underserviced and financially neglected citizens across the globe could right now.\nBitcoin is monetary sovereignty, and this experiment is being stress-tested every day.\nYou didn\u2019t need me to show and tell you that but that also doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t do it again.\nIf you have tips or places you think Colin should visit, drop him a line on Twitter (@AsILayHodling) or email (colin@bitcoinmagazine.com).\n\nColin is an associate editor and staff writer for Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0 He's proud to call Nashville his home, where he lives with his family and doesn't eat hot chicken as much as you might think.\u00a0\n", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 4}

These members of the WBTC DAO are a mixture of liquidity, infrastructure and custodial partners. The token\u2019s network will rely on some of them to facilitate BTC to WBTC swaps for its users.\nTo exchange their BTC for WBTC or vice versa, users must enter into a request with a WBTC merchant, someone who basically \u201csells\u201d (or more accurately, distributes) WBTC to users in exchange for bitcoin (or bitcoin in exchange for WBTC) and go through KYC. These merchants act as a go-between for the user and the network\u2019s liquidity pool, the custodians.\nThat merchant takes this request to a custodian, who will either deny or honor the request and mint or burn WBTC for the user. Minting and burning takes place directly between the merchant and the custodian through an atomic swap, a protocol that allows users to trustlessly trade assets cross-chain \u2014in this case, BTC and WBTC.\nTo trigger the process, a merchant would submit a minting request to an Ethereum smart contract while simultaneously sending bitcoin to the custodian.\n\u201cThe custodian then waits for 6 confirmations on the bitcoin chain, and approves the minting request on the Ethereum network, and the approval triggers the mint operation in which the merchant gets the WBTC,\u201d Yaron Velner, the CTO of Kyber Network, told Bitcoin Magazine.\nThe user is not involved in this swap in this first swap in any way. To claim their tokens/bitcoin, the user then has to enter in either an atomic swap or a trusted exchange with the merchant.\nKyber Network and Republic Protocol will kickstart the network as its first merchants, and\nEight Wrapped Bitcoin community members(AirSwap, Dharma, ETHfinex, GOPAX, Kyber Network, Prycto, Ren and Set Protocol) will kickstart the network\u2019s WBTC and BTC liquidity vehicle as merchants, while BitGo will be the sole custodian to start.\nMembers of the WBTC DAO will oversee a multisignature wallet that will handle the permissions and keys necessary for assigning or retracting merchant and custodian roles.\nThe (Peg) Ins and Outs\nThe project promises to bring Ethereum smart contract utility to bitcoin and the benefit of bitcoin\u2019s liquidity to ether\u2019s token market.\nCurrently, Ethereum dominates the decentralized exchange (DEX) landscape, and there\u2019s no way for traders to directly trade their bitcoin for tokens (they have to go through centralized exchanges for that). Giving traders the option to import bitcoin to Ethereum to trade its value as an ERC-20 token, WBTC could unleash a sea of bitcoin liquidity into Ethereum\u2019s Decentralized Exchanges \u2014 this is likely why IDEX, the largest DEX on Ethereum, is involved, along with Airswap, DDEX, ETHfinex and others).\nAs an ERC-20 token, WBTC can also execute smart contracts, meaning dApps could use the token (like WBTC community partners Compound, Dharma, dYdX, bZx, Gnosis, Maker and Set protocol), and developers can start building new applications on WBTC. Wholesale, the project sells itself as \u201c[combing] the benefits of Ethereum and Bitcoin, making it simple to handle the wrapped currency with only the Ethereum node.\u201d\nIt\u2019s an ambitious project, bringing together crypto\u2019s two most valued networks, one that wants to utilize the best of both cipher worlds. It\u2019s one, though, that Wrapped Bitcoin is backing up with immediate utility and liquidity at launch, but it\u2019s also one that comes with tradeoffs.\n\u201cKyber Network and Ren have procured an initial amount of WBTC tokens from their own Bitcoin inventory to provide initial liquidity and make WBTC immediately available for swaps with users. BitGo will be the initial custodian,\u201d a press release states.\n\u201cEight initial merchants will be facilitating conversion between WBTC and BTC: AirSwap, Dharma, ETHfinex, GOPAX, Kyber Network, Prycto, Ren, and Set Protocol.\u201d\nThe token service is starting centralized, and you have to go through KYC to be verified with merchants to submit token minting or burning requests. BitGo will be the sole custodian from the beginning, meaning that all swaps will be conducted by the blockchain and wallet services company.\n\u201cVarious decentralized and centralized exchanges have also procured WBTC inventory to support liquidity for the token with the live supply of WBTC observable on the WBTC dashboard,\u201d the press release also states.\u201d WBTC will also have usage on a handful of dApps out the gate, including \u201cbZx, Compound, Dharma, dYdX, and DApps and wallets integrated with Kyber Network.\u201d CoinGecko, the project\u2019s market data partner, will be covering WBTC data.\nCautions and Clarifications\nThe service is fairly centralized out of the gate, something the project recognizes in its whitepaper, describing its structure as a \u201cfederated governance model.\u201d Even if the merchants are distributed (and sparsely at that for the time being), BitGo\u2019s custody of pegged-in bitcoin is both a counterparty risk and single point of failure. Of course, BitGo has multisignature and cold wallet services to mitigate these risks.\nBut for a project that brands itself as giving users an out from centralized services like exchanges, it offers a similar degree of centralization with just a few more steps (instead of submitting your coins to the custody of a centralized exchange, you\u2019re putting them in custody with a separate company and then using the tokens of credit this company gives you (instead of the credit you\u2019d use on the centralized exchange) to trade them elsewhere.\nStill a functional bitcoin-to-ethereum bridge is a novel addition to the industry's architecture, something that RSK is working on and Blockstream could theoretically build with Liquid. And, as Vitalik Buterin said on Twitter, Liquid\u2019s federated sidechain is semi-subject to the same centralization as Wrapped Bitcoin, but Liquid\u2019s liquidity partners are more evenly distributed (and don\u2019t require a third party for custody).\nWBTC, like Liquid, could sufficiently decentralize in the future given enough adoption, Buterin concludes.\n\nSidechains like Liquid work in exactly the same way. Granted Liquid currently has more participants, but I hope WBTC can decentralize somewhat over time too.\u2014 Vitalik Non-giver of Ether (@VitalikButerin) January 30, 2019\n\n\nWrapped Bitcoin lists BitGo as its \u201cinitial\u201d custodian, leaving a vague sense that more will come in the future, but they will have to be regulated to hold the bitcoin, the project\u2019s whitepaper makes clear If its influence fans out, more merchants and custodians could provide some risk mitigation and help the project decentralize. Its website has open applications for partnerships, keeping with the initiative's claim to be a community-driven effort.\n\u201cThe fundamental design of WBTC and the continuing commitment of all members to openness will form the essential building blocks for a transparent process framework and governance structure. Relying on these foundational principles, WBTC will remain a firmly community-led initiative into the future, focused on driving continued innovation for the enhancement of the entire ecosystem.\u201d", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 1}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThis article is a direct follow-up from our Taproot explainer. If you haven\u2019t read that article, you should probably do so first.\nIf Taproot is deployed on Bitcoin, many smart contract constructions will look just like regular transactions on the blockchain. As long as all participants agree on the outcome of the contract \u2014 a \u201ccooperative close\u201d \u2014 the clever combination of Schnorr and MAST offers both data efficiency and privacy.\nHowever, if a Taproot smart contract is complex enough \u2014 that is, if there are many potential outcomes \u2014 the Merkle path that needs to be revealed in case of an uncooperative close would still be data heavy.\nA follow-up proposal by Bitcoin Core contributor Gregory Maxwell, \u201cGraftroot,\u201d could provide similar benefits as Taproot but without this downside, offering even more smart contract flexibility.\nGraftroot\nWith Taproot, all participants in a smart contract combine their public keys to create a \u201cthreshold public key,\u201d from which they can spend with their \u201cthreshold signature.\u201d For Graftroot, all participants create such a threshold public key as well. But this time, they do not tweak this threshold public key.\nThe participants do create the different scripts: the alternative conditions under which the money can be spent. But, with Graftroot, they all sign the different scripts to create threshold signatures corresponding with these scripts. Any participant that wishes to use a particular script as a fallback takes and stores that script and the corresponding threshold signature. These signatures can later prove to the world that the script was a valid alternative, a \"delegation\", agreed upon by all participants.\nSo, let\u2019s say that Alice and Bob establish a smart contract where both of them can spend funds together, or have Alice alone spend it after a week, or have Bob alone spend it in combination with a secret number. In this case, Alice and Bob combine their public keys to create a threshold public key from which they can later spend the funds if they provide the threshold signature. (They do not create this threshold signature yet \u2014 only when they spend the funds.)\nThen, they also create and immediately sign the alternative scripts. Alice keeps the threshold signature corresponding to the script that lets her spend the coins after a week, and Bob keeps the threshold signature corresponding to the script that lets him spend the coins in combination with a secret number. (Note that the threshold signatures and corresponding scripts alone don\u2019t suffice to spend the coins; they just prove that the scripts are agreed on by both Alice and Bob. The conditions specified in the scripts still need to be met to spend the coins.)\nThe next day, when the time comes to settle the contract, Alice and Bob will likely agree to sign the settlement transaction. They, together, create a threshold signature to spend from the threshold public key, and no one else learns about the alternative spending conditions, or even that more than one person was involved. It looks like a regular transaction.\nBut, if the cooperative close fails for some reason, whoever can meet an alternative condition gets to spend the coins alone. If Bob has the secret number, he reveals \u201chis\u201d alternative script in combination with the threshold signature corresponding to the script. The rest of the world can check the threshold signature against the threshold public key, and will conclude that all participants in the smart contract agreed on the alternative script. Bob can, therefore, rightfully spend the coins with the secret number. Alternatively, if a week has passed, Alice can reveal \u201cher\u201d alternative script in combination with the threshold signature for the script and spend the coins. In either case, no one learns of the alternative backup script.\nThe main benefit of Graftroot is that it no longer matters how complex a smart contract is or, more accurately, how many possible outcomes there are. While the above example only includes two alternative scripts, a Graftroot construction could include hundreds, and it wouldn\u2019t make a difference. Alice and Bob could even add more conditions after the original smart contract was constructed!\nA downside, however, is that Graftroot is interactive. Participants must communicate with each other to sign the alternative scripts, even before spending the coins. Additionally, participants will need to store the threshold signatures for the alternative scripts; if they lose this signature, they lose their fallback.\nGraftroot\u2019s Development\nSo, when will Bitcoin users be able to utilize this tech?\nThe good news is that with Segregated Witness, a feature called \u201cScript Versioning\u201d allows for a relatively easy rollout of these types of changes \u2014 Schnorr signatures, Taproot, Graftroot \u2014 in a backwards-compatible manner.\nStill, ideally, the Bitcoin Core contributors working on these kinds of upgrades \u2014 this includes Pieter Wuille, Anthony Towns, Johnson Lau, Jonas Nick, Andrew Poelstra, Tim Ruffing, Rusty Russell and Gregory Maxwell \u2014 would prefer to roll out all these improvements at once. While script versioning makes upgrading easy, it does require that transactions reveal which protocol upgrade is being used. So while Graftroot could perfectly hide that alternative scripts were available, the script version could still reveal that the transaction is using Graftroot. Deploying multiple protocol upgrades at once avoids this to an extent, as they'd all use the same script version. On top of that, deploying several upgrades at once benefits software compatibility.\nOn the other hand, a \u201crelatively easy rollout\u201d is still a huge undertaking when it comes to consensus changes on a security-critical protocol that is running 24/7, sometimes with varying interests and preferences when it comes to upgrades. Each potential feature has its own trade-offs, so combining many at once could also lead to more objections. And, of course, combining more features into a single upgrade doesn\u2019t make the development process any easier either.\nFor now, therefore, Schnorr signatures and Taproot are prioritized, to be proposed as a single package. Graftroot could be a step after that.\nThis is a general outline of the Graftroot concept; implementation specifics may vary.

Mallers also spoke with Bitcoin Magazine to elaborate on some of the inner workings of the project.\nZap\u2019s new PoS protocol was recently put to the test at a Chicago cocktail lounge, uploading the menu onto the app and allowing customers to use a QR code for tipping. Mallers built a device to allow the establishment to run the app, a \u201cRock64 board (4GB ram) with a Samsung SSD (1TB).\u201d Mallers said that the current hardware rig \u201cis very similar to a Nodl (nodl.it) device\u201d and that \u201cthe founder of Nodl (ketominer) was very helpful with advising the build out of the box.\u201d\nSelf-sovereignty was a huge design concern for rolling out this app, so for the final product \u201ctotal costs for the device hardware were under $200, and that was non-manufactured and ordered from Amazon. This allows the merchant to be fully validating, always online, and not reliant on any third party. The most powerful position any merchant can be in.\u201d\nLooking forward, Mallers said, \u201cI'd like to help Bitcoin enter a more consumer-facing era, and build this new relationship with end users via the Lightning Network. However Zap can best help Bitcoin achieve adoption and success, is where Zap will go.\u201d\nWith the first test launch successful, he went on to state that he\u2019s seen a lot of demand from people in specific industries, \u201clike marijuana for example, that struggle with banking relationships and are very interested in Zap PoS. We plan to continue working on the app(s) to get them to a point where they are helping real people. You can definitely expect more to come.\u201d\nThe Lightning Network has already been heralded as a technology with the potential to completely transform the industry, with a way to circumvent the scaling problem associated with Bitcoin. Many companies have been taking notice of the network\u2019s advantages and have made their own attempts to capitalize on it. BitFury, for example, has recently rolled out Lightning Peach, its own set of tools for the Lightning Network, including a PoS system.\nFor Mallers, spreading the use of the Lightning Network was the principal driver behind building the Zap PoS application and holding the Chicago event. \u201cWe want to humanize the Lightning protocol [and] present it in a way that is digestible, understandable, easy to communicate with, etc.\u201d\nThe road to large-scale adoption won\u2019t be easy, of course.\n\u201cGetting all of this right doesn't take genius insight, rather learning from repeated efforts,\u201d said Mallers. \u201cIt simply requires time and persistent ambitious effort towards a common goal.\u201d\nNevertheless, Mallers seemed confident in the overall feasibility of this technology. \u201cThe benefits are clear. There is no more powerful position to be in than a self-sovereign merchant. Nobody can deny you payment, no paybacks, no down time, no banking issues, no border restrictions, attracts new customers, etc. There is literally only upside in this.\u201d", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 25}

Bitcoin Magazine has asked a number of long-time members of the space to reflect on their experiences, and published author Simon Dixon spoke with us about some of his observations over the years.\nDixon has been a participant in the space for years, speaking at the first Bitcoin conference in Prague and writing the first published book to include Bitcoin. Most notably, Dixon was also the founder of the multi-million dollar investment platform BnkToTheFuture, one of the most successful in the space. Using his long experience with the industry, Dixon was able to answer several questions about Bitcoin\u2019s progress.\nBitcoin Magazine: What changes have you noticed in the valuation of Bitcoin? The dips and highs the market has subjected it to have varied wildly over the years.\nSimon Dixon: What we\u2019re seeing, over the years, is that liquidity was ultra-low in the early days and volume has significantly increased. We still have a very volatile asset based upon people not knowing what impact Bitcoin\u2019s going to have in the world. What we have seen is that with each cycle, each boom and bust, the percentage correction seems to decrease, and it seems to be converging toward less volatility.\nWhat about the levels of awareness? Do people in your experience still react with as much skepticism when Bitcoin is mentioned, if they\u2019re even informed enough to have skeptical opinions?\nWhen I first got involved in Bitcoin and I told people about it, most people had a perception that it was a scam, a Ponzi scheme \u2026 or, if they researched a bit further, a currency just for drug dealers. What I have noticed more recently, especially after the 2017 boom, was that almost everywhere I traveled in the world, no matter what country I went to, no matter who I spoke to, almost every single person that I would speak to from very different walks of life had at least heard of Bitcoin. Many of them still had the perception that it was either a scheme, scam or currency just for drug dealers, but many others had different perceptions. Awareness has definitely increased, and now it\u2019s time to turn that awareness into a greater understanding of what Bitcoin actually does.\nBitcoin has certainly come a long way since the earliest days of crypto anarchists and skepticism of state and financial institutions. How would you characterize the shifting relationship between world governments and Bitcoin through the years?\nBitcoin has been tested by every single regulator, government theory and ideology out there. So, originally Bitcoin was just something that governments would ignore, and, in the early days, we had China making some opinions about what Bitcoin was, as well as different countries. But now we\u2019ve seen the different schools of thought and regulatory ideologies around this. Some governments believe it\u2019s property, others a commodity, others a security or currency. The reality is that Bitcoin has all of these properties, and governments react in different ways. We have seen Japan embrace it, we\u2019ve seen China ban it, and still Bitcoin continues. We\u2019ve seen companies try to ban it, and that really has no impact. Most of the early objections of governments trying to shut us down have been disproven.\nIf Bitcoin has proven itself so successful in working with governments, how do you see its ultimate mission of becoming a new world currency?\nI think it has actual feasibility as a world reserve currency. It was originally created as an alternative to the global system, and it allows people to send money peer-to-peer, in a way that can\u2019t be censored or confiscated, with a monetary policy independent of any individual fiat currency or government agenda. I think we\u2019re much closer to achieving that goal.\nWe\u2019ve seen Bitcoin become the world reserve currency of cryptocurrencies. We\u2019ve seen people transition from using it as a transactional currency to this thought of it being a store of value. People have started to rethink of it as something that you hold rather than something you transact with all the time.\nWhat I think we\u2019re going to see next is the fact that it is independent of every government, and that it\u2019s perfectly placed for central banks to start accumulating it as a hedge against some of their traditional fiat currency assets that they are holding. I believe that Bitcoin is on the path to becoming the world reserve cryptocurrency, as long as it can solve the scalability issues.", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 25}

A narrow range of $200 has caused a weeks worth of activity to coil and consolidate in preparation for bitcoin\u2019s next move:\n\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Narrow Range\nThe figure above shows just how narrow the range has been over the last week as the market has continued to grind out support and fail to break above overhanging resistance. The thick, blue line shows a prior support level that is now resistance. The lower highs and the lower lows are continuing to show signs of diminishing demand and continuing supply on the macro scale. However, if we look at lower time frames, we do see some signs of potential accumulation:\n\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 4-Hour Candles, Potential Accumulation Range\nA closer look at the narrow range shows a well-established horizontal boundary (shown in green) with consolidating volume. The one and only candle that breached the lower boundary of the range occured on low volume and was immediately rejected on relatively strong demand pressure. The consolidating volume and tight, narrow spread at the lower boundary of the trading range is often a sign accumulation is taking place. However, it should be noted that these low volume/low liquidity conditions make it fairly difficult to read trading ranges.\nIf this range proves to be an accumulation, we should look for a daily close above the blue level, and, ultimately, a close above the green trading range shown below:\n\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Immediate Resistance and Support Levels\nIf we manage to close above the green trading range, we can expect to see a test of the upper, macro range (upper blue line). From there we will have to reassess and see if we can close above that level. However, if we pop a new low and close below the current, green trading range, that would likely yield a shove to retest prior lows in lower $3,000s. For now, we are currently tightly coiled and ready for the next big move. Due to the low volume/low liquidity conditions, the volatility is high and it is advisable to wait for a daily close to gain a more objective standpoint of the market conditions.\nSummary:\nA tightly bound market has the market ping-ponging within a $200 range over the last week.There is a decent argument for an accumulation range on low time frames, but the markets are highly volatile so its best to wait for the daily signals for a stronger view of the market.Because the market is so tightly bound between support and resistance levels, a close below or above the outlined levels will likely yield a strong continuation in the direction of the breakout.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

With this new exchange, users will be able to avoid touching the blockchain when they decide to buy or sell bitcoin for cash.\nThe new exchange was founded by former Neo & Bee Managing Director Danny Brewster, who says he is on a mission to restore his credibility after his last venture infamously failed in spectacular fashion.\nHow It Works\nBrewster is also behind AAO Global, a company that provides store operators with digital kiosks that can be used by customers to purchase anything from prepaid cell phone minutes to Xbox Live subscriptions. The plan is to add FastBitcoins.com as one of the 5,000 voucher options on these hardware terminals.\n\u201cWe take away the current pain points blocking normal people buying bitcoins; there is no complex process involving signing up to a Bitcoin exchange or network and having to convert your money,\u201d said Brewster. \u201cCustomers can now just walk into a Fastbitcoins.com partner shop and buy bitcoins with the same ease and speed as buying a prepaid telephone/cell-phone credit/top up voucher.\u201d\nThe FastBitcoins.com terminal was originally debuted in December 2018 when a reporter bought 10 pounds worth of bitcoin from a touchscreen in the back of a London taxi.\nIn addition to the terminals, FastBitcoins.com also plans to sell physical bitcoin gift cards, integrate with existing bitcoin wallets, and build a FastBitcoins.com mobile app.\n\u201cWe are also building relationships with other distributors for integrating with our FastBitcoins.com systems to enable the sale of vouchers through their existing hardware,\u201d added Brewster.\nFastBitcoins.com also has a partnership with crypto payment platform Bitrefill, which means any of the gift cards and other services sold via Bitrefill will also be available for sale via the FastBitcoins.com terminal. Additionally, FastBitcoins.com voucher codes can be purchased via Bitrefill.\nEarlier this month, Bitrefill also stepped into the Lightning space when it launched Thor, a service that allows customers to open Lightning channels on demand.\nFastBitcoins.com\u2019s fees start at 6 percent to buy bitcoin and 3 percent to sell for unregistered users. Fees become lower if the user is willing to register an account or verify their personal information.\nIn terms of buy and sell limits, Brewster stated, \u201cYou must be registered to sell to us, and the limit depends on the retail locations near the user and their limits for paying out cash. The buying limits depend upon jurisdiction, but you can buy up to \u00a3250 worth of bitcoin in the UK per voucher without an account. However, we do have monitoring in place to ensure the structuring of transactions isn't occurring.\u201d\nCurrently, FastBitcoins.com's products and services are available at locations in the U.K., but the company plans to have some locations set up in Canada before March as well. Locations set up in the U.K. right now include convenience stores, money transfer agents, a tattoo parlor, and the aforementioned London black cab.\nBitcoin Magazine was able to try out the FastBitcoins.com system before launch. An image of a test voucher was shared by FastBitcoins.com, and it was easily redeemed for bitcoin via the Lightning Network after entering an email address and copying and pasting a Lightning Network invoice.\n\nTippin.me was used as the destination for redeeming the voucher via the Lightning Network. Thankfully, FastBitcoins.com had a Lightning channel open with Tippin.me.\nDanny Brewster\u2019s Controversial Past: Neo & Bee\nThose who are new to the Bitcoin space may not be familiar with Brewster\u2019s controversial past.\nBack in 2014, Neo & Bee was building a \u201cbitcoin bank\u201d and payment system in Cyprus. This was not long after the bail-ins happened in the European country, and there was a lot of hype around the Neo & Bee project. Shares of Neo & Bee\u2019s parent company, LMB Holdings, were made available via the Havelock Investments platform, which was sort of a more centralized precursor to the ICO mania seen in 2017.\nNeo & Bee seemed to collapse as soon as it was open for business. In short, Brewster was facing allegations of fraud, LMB Holdings trading was halted on Havelock Investments and Brewster ended up leaving Cyprus to go back to the United Kingdom.\nBrewster claimed a threat was made on his daughter\u2019s life after he returned to the U.K.\n\u201cRegular messages directing me to hang myself were commonplace for the first year,\u201d said the former Neo & Bee managing director.\nAccording to Brewster, he eventually met with Cypriot police in the U.K. for a five-hour interview regarding the various allegations against him on the condition that he did not have a lawyer present.\n\u201cI knew I was innocent,\u201d said Brewster. \u201cI attended what turned out to be a five-hour interview and made a recording using my mobile phone. By the end of the interview the officers stated that the case would now be closed and passed to the Attorney General's office for them to close it, because it was evident that no crime had been committed and the allegations were false. They also offered the advice to see those responsible in court for the accusations they have made, in an effort to recover the financial losses caused by their actions.\u201d\nAt the end of 2014, Neo & Bee was listed, behind the collapse of Mt. Gox and the ongoing trial of alleged Silk Road administrator Ross Ulbricht, as the third biggest crypto scandal of the year, as rated by CoinDesk.\nMastering Bitcoin author Andreas Antonopoulos and Adamant Capital founding partner Tuur Demeester both posted their accounts of what had happened with Neo & Bee, as Antonopoulos consulted for them and Demeester had bought one share in the company.\nAccording to Brewster, the company\u2019s issues started with a simple accounting error. He shared his full take on the saga in a 2017 interview with Bitcoin Uncensored.\n\u201cWhen all that was happening I was polishing my coding abilities and building FastBitcoins.com,\u201d Brewster told us.\nFor Brewster, FastBitcoins.com is part of his plan to make Neo & Bee investors whole again. The business is structured in a way where it never holds customer funds, and they offer complete transparency when it comes to exchange rates and fees.\n\u201cGiven my past, I am fully aware that I will be under more scrutiny than anyone else in the Bitcoin community,\u201d said Brewster. \u201cBut I see this as an opportunity because it also puts more onus on me than anyone else in this space to deliver a safe and trustworthy service.

At the time of this article, the market is testing the support level but has yet to close and continue below. We did see a temporary close below the support level, but there was a very short-lived rally on low volume shortly after popping the fresh low.\n\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Secondary Support Level\nJust below our immediate support level exists a secondary support level (shown in red) established by a market pivot a few weeks ago. It\u2019s not entirely surprising that the drop inspired some eager bulls. It is still too early to tell, but the temporary support level doesn\u2019t appear to be inspiring much demand. The price spread is low, the volume is low, and the rally was immediately stifled on modest volume. As mentioned in our previous analysis, this is kind of a no-man's-land due to the market indecision within this range.\n\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Upper and Lower Bound of Current Range\nThe figure above shows the overhanging resistance (shown in blue and red) that rejected the bullish attempts to break out. We can clearly see that the daily candles at the top of the range closed lower and lower, ultimately being rejected with high volume and high price spread.\nSimilarly, the market has seen lower and lower closes at the bottom of the range with lower reactionary volume and tighter spread. This sort of market behavior is indicative of high supply presence combined with relatively weak and waning demand.\nCurrently, we need to see if the market breaks and closes below the current low. If we manage to close below the current level, we can expect to see a test of the next support level in the low $3,000s. However, if we manage to exhaust the bears at this level, we can fully expect to see a test of the upper boundary of the range once again.\nWe are firmly bound in this price range, and a breakout of the range in either direction will likely yield a strong continuation in the direction of the breakout. As always, we must wait to see where the daily candle closes, but for the time being, the current market seems to be leaning toward a test of the lower support.\nSummary:\nFor the last week, bitcoin has been pretty tightly coiled in a relatively narrow range.We closed a lower low on the daily candles but have yet to break through support.The currently price level is bordering on the no-man\u2019s-land of the no-trade zone inside the range. If we manage to close below the current support level, we can expect to see a test of the low $3,000s.

{"title": "BetterHash Protocol Lets Pool Miners Regain Control Over Their Hash Power", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/betterhash-protocol-lets-pool-miners-regain-control-over-their-hash-power/", "birthday": "Jan 25, 2019  3:42 PM EST", "date": "2019-01-25 20:42:00", "content": "Crypto: Trading, Mining, Research, and Education.\nOne problem that concerns many is the centralization of mining within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Fortunately, there are talented developers working to solve this problem and Matt Corallo, full-time Bitcoin developer at Chaincode Labs, is one of them. His BetterHash Mining Protocol is intended to significantly decrease the problems associated with mining pool centralization.\nWhat Are Mining Pools?\nFirst, it is important to understand there are different types of miners on the network. For the purpose of this article, we\u2019ll refer to a \u201csolo miner\u201d as someone who mines alone, a \u201chasher\u201d is someone who mines in a mining pool, and a \u201cpool operator\u201d controls the mining pool.\nSolo mining is risky, as there is only a relatively small share of hash power contributing to the generation of the block. When a solo miner finds a block the reward may be larger, but the payouts will be less frequent. For this reason, many miners join pools so that they can receive frequent payouts of smaller amounts. Pooling is when a number of miners (hashers) join together and pay their block rewards into a single pot. When any of them finds a block, instead of getting the entire block reward, the amount gets distributed to all of the hashers in the pool proportionate to the amount of hash rate they contribute to the network (minus a fee for the pool operator). This way, a smaller hasher receives consistent payouts on a daily \u2014 and, in some cases, hourly \u2014 basis.\nOverall, the primary function of a mining pool is to provide consistent payouts to miners so that they can reduce their risk. Mining pools also serve important secondary functions that improve the overall network. For instance, a smaller and less technical miner may not want to deal with the complexities a pool operator faces such as block propagation, block creation and other highly technical matters. Joining a mining pool gives less-technical miners a simple way to access the network so they can focus on their strengths, such as running an efficient mining business or locating cheap power.\nHowever, because of this, currently only a few, large mining pools dominate the network, which results in a high degree of centralization within the system.\nWhat Is Stratum?\nStratum is the protocol layer between mining pools, clients and mining hardware. Users connect and communicate with the pool through the Stratum protocol. On a mining hardware device such as an ASIC, there is a control board which runs a variant of software, such as CG Miner, which then \u201cspeaks\u201d Stratum and connects to the pool. The pool tells the ASIC what to work on, and the ASIC responds by submitting back shares to the pool. A share is work that an ASIC has done, essentially not-quite valid blocks, but enough to prove that the miner has contributed work for the pool.\nCorallo\u2019s first objective for BetterHash is to replace Stratum and improve upon its weaknesses. In Corallo\u2019s Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP), he describes some of the current drawbacks of Stratum:\n\u201cDifficult to implement and poorly documented, the design of the Stratum protocol requires pool operators to build and distribute block templates to their clients. Without a diverse body of miners constructing block templates, the network's censorship resistance is jeopardized (e.g. pool operators may use their position of power to restrict the flow of protocol upgrades).\u201d\nWith Stratum, a pool operator confirms that each miner has contributed work for the pool. The pool operator is also responsible for creating a block template which handles transaction selection. With the inability to create a block template, miners have no control over what they are mining. A pool operator controls the entire pool\u2019s hash rate.\nThis is problematic because a pool operator, or a small group of pool operators, could potentially collude by using this hash power to perform malicious attacks on the network. A bad actor with this amount of hash power could initiate a 51% attack and perform double spends or censorship on the network. Alternatively, if a malicious actor were to hijack a pool\u2019s DNS server or IP space, an attacker could steal hash rate until all the miners power cycled their ASIC hardware.\nBetterHash vs. Stratum\nBetterHash is intended to prevent these kinds of attack vectors because it is designed to allow users to run their own full node and build their own block template. Building your own block template means you can select your own transactions; for example, transactions which may have otherwise been censored. Additionally, miners can select which blocks they are mining on in order to prevent double-spend attacks.\nAlthough block templates are customizable, pools will continue to act as they normally would, redistributing block rewards relative to hash power with the same business properties and payout frequency.\nCorallo commented in an interview with Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song:\n\u201cWe could have just one pool for the entire network, and it wouldn\u2019t really be a big deal.\u201d\nBetterHash Protocol Overview and the Advantages of Weak Blocks\nBetterHash is comprised of a set of protocols which, when combined, are intended to provide more documentation, efficiency, security and decentralization to mining pools. In Matt Corallo\u2019s BIP, he describes the two main protocols in \u201cBetterHash: Work and Pool.\u201d\n\u201cThe work-carrying protocol replaces both getblocktemplate and Stratum when passed directly to mining hardware, while the payout protocol manages all pool<->client communication. The segregation of these functions provide pool participants with the ability to construct block templates with transactions they (or another pool of their choice) have selected while the pool oversees the distribution of payouts.\u201d\nThese protocols provide hashers with the information on how they should build a coinbase transaction (the block reward) as well as where to send the mining reward. Additionally, they provide users with the information on how to upload shares to the pool so miners can prove they have contributed work for the pool. Overall, the separation of these two protocols enables hashers to create custom block templates while still receiving the economic benefits a mining pool offers.\nAn additional feature of the pool protocol is the ability to send weak blocks, which helps pools optimize block propagation. Corallo describes this protocol in his proposal:\n\u201cThe Pool Protocol has an optional additional feature for pools which wish to optimize block propagation, whereby clients send WEAK_BLOCKs to the pool server so that uploads of full blocks are efficient.\u201d\nWeak blocks are not a new idea, but they can be beneficial when implemented successfully. Weak blocks are shares that users frequently submit to a pool. Remember, a share is work that has been performed by mining hardware but is not enough for a full block. Every time the pool finds a new block with the same difficulty as an old weak block, the pool can send a compressed version of the weak block and compare it with the new block. Users of the pool submit valid shares via WINNING_NONCE or SHARE/WEAK_BLOCK messages. This comparison allows the pool to upload full blocks faster and ultimately increase mining efficiency.\nAlthough BetterHash is intended to give back power to the miners, it takes technical knowledge to create a block template. Not all miners want to deal with these complexities. For this reason, Corallo explained that he is not expecting less technical miners to switch to BetterHash overnight:\n\u201cPools optimize software on behalf of their users. For this reason, I don\u2019t think a lot of pools (hashers) have interest in adopting a protocol (BetterHash) like this when it requires them effort such as managing and running a full node.\u201d\nCriticisms of BetterHash\nWhile many are optimistic about BetterHash\u2019s potential to decrease mining centralization, Corallo\u2019s proposal has received some criticism. One of the most prominent criticisms of BetterHash came from Eric Voskuil, Libbitcoin developer and founder of Bitware Co. Voskuil\u2019s primary argument is that BetterHash does not meaningfully decrease decentralization. He described his perspective on GitHub as well as in a Twitter discussion:\n\u201cThis proposal [BetterHash] does not increase the security of #bitcoin through increased decentralization, it merely shifts the point of centralization. This is essentially the same flaw that he [Matt Corallo] produced in his work on relays.\u201d\nThe reason BetterHash is criticized for \u201cmerely shifting the point of centralization\u201d is because pool operators still maintain a large amount of control as they could force hashers to censor certain transactions at the threat of not receiving payouts.\nIn response to this argument, Corallo told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cWhile it is true that pools could still exert influence over their clients by telling them to run certain rules or they will refuse payouts, this requires active action on the part of both the pool and the client. Today, a pool could simply switch without telling their users and it would require some significant effort on the part of the clients to even discover this, let alone inform other users of the same pool and switch to a competitor. With Betterhash, a pool would need to inform their users, at which point it would be easier for users to switch pools than to switch out their nodes.\u201d\nAlthough the software to build a mining pool and use BetterHash is currently available, no large mining pools are using it. Today, Corallo continues to work on (among other things) increasing the adoption of BetterHash so miners will have additional options in the future.", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 25}

BitPatron, a Bitcoin-friendly version of the website, has recently come to the surface as a possible alternative.\nA Series of Bans\nOne of the first well-known bans dates back to August 2018 when James Allsup, a far-right political commentator, was banned from the funding platform.\nIn December, a wave of media attention ensued when another alt-right activist and spokesperson, Milo Yiannopoulos, was shut down almost 24 hours after he had set up an account to fund his \u201cmagnificent 2019 comeback tour.\u201d Patreon\u2019s reasoning for removing Yiannopoulos\u2019s account was due to his past association with the Proud Boys, a violent, far-right political group (whose founders were kicked off of Facebook and Twitter recently as well).\nOnly a day after Yiannopoulos\u2019s ban, British YouTuber Sargon of Akkad had his account removed for violating Patreon\u2019s hate speech guidelines by making racist and hateful remarks toward minority groups.\nAnother notable example occurred when Patreon had to close an account against their will when Mastercard required them to remove the account of Robert Spencer, a political activist and author of several \u201ccounter-Jihad\u201d books.\nIn response to Spencer\u2019s removal and other account bans, Jordan Peterson, professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, and David Rubin, creator and host of The Rubin Report, announced they were leaving Patreon because of the way that the platform has handled these situations.\nBitcoin and BitPatron\nBitcoin is a censorship-resistant currency. One of its many valuable attributes is that nobody can tell anyone what they can or cannot do with their bitcoin. As long as someone is able to receive bitcoin (which, by design, is very easy to do), no transaction from anywhere can be stopped.\nBitPatron is a direct response to Patreon\u2019s proclivity to censor content on the platform. It will offer a similar crowdfunding platform as its predecessor, but will allow users to support creators with bitcoin.\nBy using Bitcoin and Lightning as payment methods, BitPatron expects to offer lower fees than its competitor. BitPatron\u2019s payment processing system is built on top of BTCPayServer, an open-source payment processor for Bitcoin and Lightning. According to the website, there is no minimum pledge amount, compared to Patreon\u2019s $1 minimum. Total fees for the platform are 4 percent, much lower than Patreon\u2019s 10 percent.\nThe platform\u2019s co-founder believes that, more than just offering users a lower fee competitor to Patreon, BitPatron\u2019s focus on bitcoin is about free speech.\n\u201cPatreon publicly admitted that Mastercard required them to remove accounts. This is where Bitcoin and BitPatron come in. Bitcoin is censorship-resistant, free-speech money, and BitPatron is taking a leading role at building a Bitcoin-based, censorship-resistant platform that gives the power back to the community where it belongs,\u201d Vin, co-founder of BitPatron, told Bitcoin Magazine.\nBut BitPatron is still not a completely, \u201canything goes\u201d platform yet. A spokesperson for the company told Bitcoin Magazine: \u201cFor now, we are planning to monitor and block only in extreme cases, such as illegal pornography, threats or calls for violence, or terrorism-related content.\nHe added that ideally, in its purest form there would be no centralized control, but there\u2019d be some sort of decentralized algorithm to perform the necessary checks. \u201cThat's why we are considering blockchain platforms that would allow users to self-host their content and be responsible for it.\n\u201cWe want to remain a platform for every voice, which is, in our opinion, a far greater task than monitoring \u2018hate speech.\u2019 We therefore need to make sure that the platform remains interesting for voices of the entire spectrum.\u201d\nWho Is It For?\nBitPatron will first allow podcasters and video creators to offer exclusive content to their supporters, and it also has plans integrate with Discord groups to support chat rooms.\nIn the bigger picture, a platform like BitPatron could support content creators from all walks of media. It is a platform where people receive financial support from others all across the world in a seamless and instant way with a censorship-resistant currency.\nAccording to the platform, the public beta will go live next month.", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 18}

Binance Jersey will allow trading of popular cryptocurrencies bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) against the euro (EUR) and the British pound (GBP).\nThe exchange will launch with four trading pairs, including BTC/GBP, ETH/GBP, BTC/EUR and ETH/EUR.\nIn a statement, Wei Zhou, Binance\u2019s chief financial officer, called the island \u201can undisputed pioneer in blockchain development leveraged by this strong framework and talent pool.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cBinance Jersey hopes to increase Jersey\u2019s competitive advantage in banking from other jurisdictions competing for cryptocurrency-related business as the island\u2019s cryptocurrency regulation allows.\u201d\nBinance and Digital Jersey first partnered in June 2018, with both companies signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) such that Binance could \u201cdevelop a compliance base and cryptocurrency exchange in Jersey.\u201d The partnership was also meant to help Binance develop a better understanding of the regulatory and economic environment of Jersey Island, particularly with compliance with anti-money laundering and know-your-customer (KYC) laws.\nAt the time, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao explained why they chose Jersey as their latest destination. \u201cWe have chosen Jersey to be the next big step in our global expansion strategy for its clear and pro-crypto investment and regulatory environment. With its local economy based on a major currency (GBP), and its proximity to the UK and Western Europe, we are confident the cooperation with Jersey will not only benefit the local economy, but also form a strong operational foundation for our expansion into the rest of Europe.\u201d\nJersey is not part of the EU; however, it maintains a special relationship with the EU through the U.K. It is only regarded as being a part of the European Union for trade in goods; otherwise the Island is not a part of the EU. (Its formal relationship is set out in Protocol 3 of the U.K.'s 1972 Accession Treaty.) The island has made its intention known to Great Britain that, post-Brexit, it intends to preserve its relationship with the European Union, as well as with the United Kingdom.\nJersey could serve as a contingency plan post-Brexit for Binance, following in the footsteps of Coinbase, which opened a Dublin office last year. Binance officials were unavailable to elaborate on these potential plans.\nRegistration on Binance Jersey started immediately, as Zhao noted in a tweet:\n\u201cBinance.je is overwhelmed with registrations. There is a backlog of KYC verifications already. More resources are allocated to reduce it. In the mean time, we appreciate your understanding and patience.

Find out what happened to him earlier on Day 1 , on Day 2 and on Day 3.\nI woke up in a state of amazement: In my three days of living on bitcoin, I had managed to survive on a handful of services and the generosity of friends.\nHungry for any place that would let me spend it, I was more determined than ever to call up every single store in the Bay Area that might accept bitcoin. A few, like Bamboo Asia and Ramen Underground, were closed yesterday, so I still had a small, if shrinking, beacon of light at the end of a tunnel of rejection.\nMost places weren\u2019t open yet, so I had a call with my editor, who was keen to hear about how it had been both too simple and hopelessly difficult.\n\u201cWell hey, there\u2019s the angle,\u201d she suggested.\nIt was an angle, but it was also a dead end of sorts. I needed to find someplace to finally spend my bitcoin to make my day-to-day purchases different for a change (though going shop-to-shop in unsuccessful attempts to spend it and acting like a hungry lunatic on Haight street could also be considered \u201csomething different\u201d).\nA bit of work, a bit of coffee, a bit of social media trumpeting and it\u2019s 11:00 a.m. Excited by the prospect of hopefully going out for lunch for once this week, I called up Bamboo Asia first.\n\u201cHello, is this Bamboo Asia?\u201d\n\u201cYes it is,\u201d a woman responded over the phone.\n\u201cDo y\u2019all still accept bitcoin?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cDo you still take bitcoin?\u201d\n\u201cBit \u2026 coin?\u201d she stuttered, a bit confused.\n\u201cI take that as a no, then?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, thank you,\u201d I hung up.\nStrike one.\nNext up: Ramen Underground:\n\u201cYes, hello, do you take bitcoin?\u201d\n\u201cBit what?\u201d\n\u201cBitcoin, the cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\u201cOh. No.\u201d\nStrike 2.\nThen, I dialed Numa, a sushi joint that had slipped through yesterday\u2019s round of solicitations:\n\u201cDo you accept bitcoin?\u201d\n\u201cDo we have corn?\u201d\nUh, no.\n\u201cNo, no, do you take bitcoin \u2014 as a method for payment?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know what that is,\u201d she said hesitantly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s internet money. It \u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh, no, no, no \u2014 no, not that, sorry.\u201d She quickly cut me off.\nStrike 3.\nWell, in reality, there were many more strikes than that. I even called Siegel\u2019s Clothing Superstore and Tuxedo, just for hell of it.\nOver the phone, the question like an incessant recording (at this point, everytime I ask, I close my eyes and squinch my face up in embarrassed anticipation for the answer).\n\u201cI \u2014 I don\u2019t think so, but let me check \u2014 can you hold on a minute?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d I answer, excited at the prospect of potentially something to go on.\n\u201cFor the current sale, I\u2019m sorry, no, they don\u2019t accept bitcoin. No Apple Pay. Just Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and, of course, U.S. cash.\u201d\nYep, I expected as much.\nThere was one last hope, but I was beginning to doubt that even Stookey\u2019s, a bar I\u2019d been told takes bitcoin by someone other than Google, would take it. If all else fails, maybe I\u2019ll get to spend it there \u2014 eventually.\n\n\nAs night rolled around, I got ready to transition to the Crypto Castle. Queen Liz had granted me two night\u2019s stay: On Tuesday, I\u2019d be on the couches upstairs, but for Monday, I\u2019d be sleeping in Jeremy\u2019s room.\nOh. Ok.\nThe gesture took me aback for a second but it made sense for the bohemian-tech aesthetic that the house has going for it. That I would sleep in a millionaire\u2019s bed one night and then a couch the next was humorous and exotic in a very benign way to me.\nIt was a short walk from Christian\u2019s apartment, only half a mile, but distance can be deceiving when San Francisco's hills tack on a couple hundred feet of elevation gain. Lugging my belongings in a 50-gallon hiking backpack, my daypack slung over my right shoulder, I schlepped myself up the hills that were sloping at a crazy 45 degrees.\nI was partially heaving when I topped the hill, turned right on Kansas Street and stopped in front of the castle\u2019s telltale blue door with a \u201cBitcoin Prefered Here\u201d sticker in the window. I pressed the buzzer.\n\u201cYes, who is it?\u201d\n\u201cColin \u2014 the Bitcoin journalist,\u201d I responded, and soon heard the door\u2019s unlatching click.\nHans, an Italian expat developer with a machine-learning background who\u2019s relatively new to the space, let me in. He has rich olive skin and curly black hair, and an apprehensive but affable personality.\nWe walked over to Jeremy\u2019s room as Hans recapped some of what Liz had told me.\n\u201cI\u2019m finishing up some work right now, do you mind?\u201d he asked as we entered the room. Apparently, Jeremy\u2019s room is a free-for-all space; he would likely have it no other way.\n\u201cOf course not \u2014 work away,\u201d I told him. I mean, it\u2019s not really my place to dictate what he can and can\u2019t do in a room that isn\u2019t mine to begin with.\nThe in-and-out style of the house\u2019s residents made for some brisk but pleasant introductions. I would meet Teddy, a tall, lanky and balding Ethereum-to-EOS developer who works with Hans. He\u2019s a bit jumpy and is into Soylent (and keeps offering me some to drink). Diego, another developer who used to play soccer at Boston College, would also come through with Kingsley, an Australian venture capitalist.\n\n\nI posted up upstairs and did some work, shot the bull with Crypto Castle denizens and made plans for the rest of the week. I also reviewed Kashmir Hill\u2019s 2014 living on bitcoin series. She had held on to some of her coins (she had a few left) and they had appreciated in value from 2013 to 2014.\nHer second series is even more entertaining than the first. With her bitcoins\u2019 increased purchasing power, she could access more exotic experiences: She spends it on winery tours, a nice (boy, I mean nice) dinner and even a riotous strip club experience.\nReading her accounts, I feel a wave of envy and the sense of a missed opportunity. She had so many more ways to spend her bitcoin; in reality, five years later, my bitcoin doesn\u2019t have the same reach and San Francisco has basically zero merchant presence. Even if I had 2\u20133 bitcoin like her at the time of this experiment, I wouldn\u2019t have a way to spend it (unless I wanted to drop it on bottles at Monarch, but that\u2019s not really my scene).\nToward the end of the day, the reality that I hadn\u2019t had one, in-person exchange with a merchant of any kind deeply depressed me.\nWhy the hell am I even doing this, and why I am spending so much money here?\nI could be doing this anywhere. I could be doing this back home. Even there \u2014 in little ol\u2019 Nashville with its tinkertoy tech scene \u2014 I could have at least bought dinner at Flyte, the only restaurant in town to accept BTC. But it\u2019s a pricey dine, so by the time the week was up I would have been out a month\u2019s rent (or a week\u2019s rent in San Francisco).\nDinnertime approaching, I decided to use a Whole Foods gift card to stock up on provisions. It was a five-minute walk from the castle, and Kashmir had used gift cards she purchased from Gyft on her second go-around, so I thought it was permissible to buy one off of Bitrefill myself.\nAt least I could tear into the San Francisco Whole Foods\u2019 hot and cold takeaway bars, an unmatched cornucopia of grocery store self-serves. Turkey pot pie, steak fries, tabouli, butternut squash, kale salad, chicken salad, couscous, shrimp, croquettes, yams, all crammed into the brown to-go box. I also got some Peet\u2019s coffee and almond croissants for the house (should have gone for whole bean because of course this house would also have a grinder).\nWhile the young woman at the counter dealt with the somewhat clunky process of redeeming my gift card \u2014 after I\u2019d had to go through the even clunkier process of buying bitcoin before buying said gift card before being able to buy the groceries in store \u2014 something Hill observes in her article resonated with me.\nNeither the cashier at Whole Foods nor any my Uber drivers/deliverers that week knew that I indirectly paid for those goods and services with bitcoin.\nThe process was more time consuming and labor intensive than paying in fiat, but it was also liberating in this way.\nBitcoin had provided me the opportunity to purchase those groceries, just as it had allowed me to buy all my Uber Eats food up till now. The merchant/drivers didn\u2019t know where the credit came from, nor where or how it was bought.\nFor Uber, KYC is a given. But with gift cards, you can use bitcoin to transact in near complete anonymity. You can bank like a ghost if you want, and you can buy most everything you need without leaving a trail of credit or debit. Like cash, bitcoin can be used as an anonymous transfer of value \u2014 you just need to transmute it into a different payment method for real-world use first. If you want to increase your anonymity, you can take steps to mask your network activity. (e.g., I started using the privacy-focused Samourai wallet on the fourth day after my BRD wallet became too unreliable).\nWith these thoughts, I returned home (unfortunately, uphill again). After hanging with the castle\u2019s crew and eating my meal, I took my rest in the bed of a guy who probably didn\u2019t even know I was sleeping there but would doubtless not care.\n\n\n\nColin's adventures continue...find out what happens on Day 5 here.\nAs Kashmir Hill did in her original journey, Colin is accepting BTC tips to help him along the way.\nTip jar: 3CnLhqitCjUN4HPYf6Qa2MmvCpSoBiFfBN\nColin is an associate editor and staff writer for Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0 He's proud to call Nashville his home, where he lives with his family and doesn't eat hot chicken as much as you might think.\u00a0\n", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 18}

If you remove decentralization, it\u2019s not an interesting project. There have been lots of centralized issuers of money \u2014 that\u2019s what causes inflation and why your savings lose purchasing power daily. The response by altcoiners is to argue that decentralization is a spectrum or, barring that, that Bitcoin is centralized.\nFirst, decentralization is not a spectrum. It either has a single point of failure or it doesn\u2019t. Centralized things are called centralized because there\u2019s a single point at which everything can fail. You either have a centralized point of failure or you don\u2019t. There\u2019s no real in-between like altcoiners would have you believe. Altcoins all have one or more of these properties which create a single point of failure:\nA creator that\u2019s still involved;A development team that forces upgrades on all the users (hard forks); orA foundation/organization which directs what the coin will do.\nSome have more than others (ETH has all three vs. XMR which has just the second); in that sense, you can say something has more single points of failure than others. Nevertheless, the fact is that if at least one single point of failure exists, the token is centralized. A government could very well control the coin with whatever regulations it wants through that single point of failure. They could, for example, arrest the creator, tax the dev team or nationalize the foundation or organization. The method by which an authority can take over doesn\u2019t really matter here: The fact that it can is what is of concern. Centralized coins have the potential to be taken over relatively easily.\nThe question here is whether bitcoin mining is a single point of failure. Could a government or other authority control Bitcoin through controlling a single entity in mining? Much has been speculated about this and that is the subject of this article. What would it actually take to \u201ctake over\u201d?\nWhat Miners Can Do\nThe miners\u2019 job is to secure the network. They do so by finding proof of work. Having 51% of the network hash power gives a single miner the ability to attack the network. That, however, is not the same as controlling the network. The attack is limited in nature and affects only the account holders attacked (say, an exchange). This is in contrast to forcing upgrades on the network, which can reset entire balances, inflate the currency or change all sorts of incentives. The latter is real control of the entire network, a real choke point, as the network rules are dictated by a single group. The former is a possible way in which some participants become vulnerable. These are two different things!\nThis distinction is crucial as altcoiners often conflate the two. The two vulnerabilities are not the same. The first is an attack vector with a lot of conditions required to execute, affecting a limited number of people; the latter is the possibility of complete takeover. Think of the former as a weakness in your army defenses and the latter as a takeover of the army for whatever purposes the conqueror pleases. The former still requires the attacker to fight out in the open. The latter is something that can be accomplished without the knowledge of anyone but the inner circle.\nIt is with this in mind that we call altcoins centralized. They can be taken over, conquered, changed by the whims of a few people. Controlling a large amount of mining hash power is not the same as that and the vulnerabilities are limited, not to mention very expensive to execute. This is the difference between a single person in charge of a bank account (who can thus embezzle, run away with the money, etc.) vs. a possibility that a valid wire transfer can be forced to wait a long time before being deposited.\nRequirements of a 51% Mining Attack\nTo bring this home, let\u2019s go through how a 51% mining attack must be executed. In order to execute a 51% attack, you first need more hashing power than the rest of the network. This means getting lots and lots of mining equipment, which costs a good deal of money. The equipment currently has long lead times and acquiring the latest generation of miners is notoriously difficult as such equipment tends to be very profitable. Using old equipment is an option, but the savings and convenience of such equipment is more than offset by the inefficiency. Either way, obtaining and running the equipment necessary is really costly. This requires incredible capital investment in order to compete with miners who are mining honestly and making a good deal of money doing it.\nFurthermore, not only do you need the equipment, but you also need the electricity. Most bitcoin mining is done at the margins of electricity profitability for power suppliers. Mining tends to move to where the power is and not vice versa. So using hydroelectric dams, solar panel farms and geothermal at the margins tend to be how mining equipment is powered. Typical miners get rates of anywhere from $0.025/kWH to $0.06/kWH. These tend to be the absolute lowest rates, and most power companies require very long contracts to supply at rates this low.\nDue to the increasing price and, thus, energy requirements, obtaining sufficient electricity to run a mining farm has become much harder over the past few years. When the Bitcoin network was small, it was perhaps possible to obtain enough electricity to run equipment that could supply 51% of the hash power, but that\u2019s become less and less feasible over time. The power consumed by the Bitcoin network continues to grow, and an attacker would need to obtain a significant amount of electricity in order to successfully execute the attack.\nThere probably are some power companies that can supply 51% of the total network energy consumption at once, but good luck trying to convince them to sell you that much in a single burst. The power business is one where consumers are locked into lots of long-term contracts: A short-term, intense burst of power for a week or two is not practical, and if it is possible, it tends to be very expensive. Remember, there are factories, businesses and farms \u2014 not to mention homes \u2014 that rely on the electricity that these power plants supply to continue operating. These can\u2019t simply be shut off to supply a hypothetical attacker with electricity.\nIn other words, as an attacker, you\u2019re going to need access to some serious amounts of electricity, which is not likely going to be available to you without controlling the power source yourself. So not only do you have to control 51% of the potential hashing power, but you\u2019ll likely need to generate the electricity yourself.\nProfit-Driven Attacks\nThe capital costs of doing a 51% attack are enormous. You\u2019ll need a large supply of really good mining equipment and a ton of electricity, neither of which you can buy off the shelf. This means that you\u2019ll likely need to produce your own mining equipment and possibly produce your own electricity. This likely requires years of lead time to produce the equipment and long-term contracts to get the required electricity. Economically, investing this much capital would only make sense if you could profit enough from the attack as to make the venture worthwhile. There are several ways to attempt to profit from this, including shorting the market or attempting a double spend, but they all require some off-ramp to take the money and run. This used to be much easier but is no longer due to the AML/KYC laws surrounding most exchanges.\nFurthermore, getting an operation like this together means that the attacker has enormous revenue potential through honest mining. This is much less risky and requires much less capital investment up front as you don\u2019t need 51% of the network.\nIn other words, economically, it really doesn\u2019t make any sense to do a 51% attack due to the costs and risk involved. Altcoins with a much lower hash rate are much more economical to attack this way.\nSovereign Attack\nThe only real potential for 51% mining attacks come from state-level actors. Assuming it\u2019s a single sovereign, such an entity would need to not care at all about the cost, have access to incredible amounts of energy and have motive to attack Bitcoin. Again, this does not give the attacker control of the network, just the ability to attack a small slice of it. Leaving aside motivation, let\u2019s look at the practical logistics.\nIn order to pull off something like this, even a sovereign nation would need to coordinate a lot of pieces to make it work. A government would need to get a large supply of hashing power, either through its own factories or through commandeering the needed equipment. This is not likely to be secret for very long and the community would likely be able to prepare. Similarly, a government would need to get a large supply of electricity in the same way. Again, this is not likely to be secret for very long. The coordination necessary would be at military levels and this is not something that most governments know how to do.\nAnd all this for what? A single double-spend that screws over a particular exchange? Again, such an attack does not destroy Bitcoin. The rest of the network keeps chugging along and if the attack is sustained, there are decentralized ways to nullify even the most hash-heavy attacks. This is not a single point of failure in the least because, simply speaking, Bitcoin won\u2019t fail that easily.\nWhy Altcoiners Are Obsessed With 51% Mining\nSo the question then turns to why so many altcoiners bring this up so often.\nFirst, it\u2019s one of the only things that\u2019s even slightly perceived as a vulnerability in Bitcoin. Remember, altcoins are competition to bitcoin and like any good competitor, it helps to FUD your competition to make yourself look better. It\u2019s a great way to distract people from the shortcomings of the centralization that their altcoin clearly has.\nSecond, they\u2019re usually trying to sell proof of stake or proof of storage or some other nonsense. This is their way of showing the benefits of their system. Most altcoiners support their altcoin because they really want their coin to be bitcoin. They want to be rich like Trace Mayer but with their coin. That\u2019s another whole article I need to write, but it\u2019s an understandable emotion driven largely by envy.\nConclusion\nMining attacks are overblown, mostly by people that are trying to print their own money (or at least be the elite in the new currency). 51% attacks are too costly to be economical, have too little a payoff to generate much money and are too limited to hurt more than perhaps a few companies or individuals.\nIt\u2019s even possible that a 51% attack that screws an exchange out of 100 BTC or so wouldn\u2019t necessarily be a bad thing for Bitcoin.

{"title": "Living on Bitcoin Day 3: Brother, Can You Take a Sat?", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/living-bitcoin-day-3-brother-can-you-take-sat/", "birthday": "Jan 17, 2019 4:01 PM EST", "date": "2019-01-17 21:01:00", "content": "This is the third instalment of reporter Colin Harper's \"Living on Bitcoin\" experience in San Francisco. Find out what happened to him earlier on Day 1 and on Day 2.\nI woke up on day 3 and made a pact with myself: I had resolved to not rely on Uber Eats that day.\nI still think that buying this credit from an exchange like Bitrefill or Paxful is in line with the experiment, but I haven\u2019t made a PoS purchase yet and I want to make today about going out and actually using bitcoin with merchants.\nOnly once I ventured out to actually try this did I realize that the trend I unearthed yesterday would become an insurmountable obstacle.\n\n\n\nI woke up in a bed this time (one had been freed up after Christian\u2019s roommate and friends left to move to LA). Like the day before, I immediately hit the coffee and continued to work on the write-up of the previous day. Little of note happened. Christian left to go back to Nashville to then go to Miami for a conference. Riggins, who had slept on the couch the night before, went with him.\nTo prep for a day of no Uber Eats, I looked up some of the places that I hadn\u2019t checked with yet to see if they still took bitcoin. The preliminary results were disheartening. Bamboo Asian and Ramen Underground are closed on Sundays. Three Babes Bakery no longer accepts crypto and neither does Elixart, even though their Nevada location does. So my prospects here in San Francisco were looking grim.\nSurely somewhere, I thought.\nResolved to make something of the day, I decide that I should just throw myself out there and see if I could stumble upon a place that would take BTC. If all the online bitcoin-as-payment finders had it wrong, maybe there were a few stores that did accept it but weren\u2019t listed.\nClinging to this hope, I ordered an Uber for Haight-Ashbury, starting off my search with a toy shop called Woot Bear that supposedly accepted bitcoin. I wasn\u2019t holding my breath.\n\n\n\nAn Uber pool took me a block away from Woot Bear and Haight street. Walking that way, I took out a sign I had prepped for my promenade in San Francisco\u2019s hippie district.\n\u201cIf you buy me food or coffee, I\u2019ll send you bitcoin. I\u2019ll help you set up a wallet and be your friend!\u201d\nI figured the absurd gesture would be in character for Haight-Ashbury\u2019s rabble of itinerants, tourists, burnouts and homeless population. People probably thought the sign was asking for handouts. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time I would be mistaken for homeless (happened earlier this year while passing out Thanksgiving meals around Nashville).\nWoot Bear\u2019s caretaker was out for lunch, so I walked around, sign in front, and went searching for food (I hadn\u2019t eaten yet) or any place that would take my coins. I didn\u2019t expect to waltz into a place and find that they take bitcoin, no more than I expected someone to take my sign seriously. Still worth the attempt. The reactions themselves when I asked were worth it.\nFinding a thrift store I visited last time I was in San Francisco, I went in and glanced at a few shirts. A tall woman with jet black hair was preoccupied with her phone behind the cashier\u2019s desk.\nAfter browsing some flannels, I walked up to ask a question I already knew the answer to.\n\u201cYes?\u201d she asked, a little annoyed, looking up from the phone after I had loomed over the desk for a few seconds.\n\u201cWhat are the chances you could be swayed to accept bitcoin?\u201d\nLips pursed on a to-go drink straw, she slowly shook a lowered head.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I expected as much,\u201d I said resignedly.\nA little farther down the strip, I walked into a run-of-the-mill smoke shop. I asked the dude working it if they accept bitcoin.\nHe just shook his head.\n\u201cKnow of any places around Haight that do,\u201d I asked, grasping at anything I could get.\n\u201cNope. Cash is king here.\u201d\nCash is king, I thought. Yeah, no kidding, bucko. What\u2019d you expect?\nI slipped into probably half a dozen more shops, receiving the same result and a mixture of reactions. One young, nose-studded barista looked like I had offended her with my question, another was simply amused and gave me a free coffee. Most young dudes that I asked would just laugh at the question, answering, \u201cNo, sorry!\u201d with a grin. The majority of people were simply confused. Some probably didn\u2019t know what it was, but they knew that they didn\u2019t accept it.\nA bit defeated, I went back to Woot Bear. Now that it was open, I asked the shopkeeper if they still accept bitcoin.\n\u201cBitcoin?\u201d she asked, pausing her phone conversation for a moment. \u201cOh, no, I\u2019m sorry we don\u2019t anymore.\u201d\nI expected as much \u2014 past results were becoming indicative of future ones.\nI asked her why they\u2019d stopped. She told me that, apparently, the payment processor they used was no longer operational.\nStill, she went on to sing bitcoin\u2019s praises emphatically to the fellow who was still on the other end of her phone call.\n\u201cBitcoin was great!\u201d she told him. \u201cIt was fee-less and it would automatically convert to money in your bank account.\u201d\nShe was treating it like some arcane truth, stammering while explaining how they used to use it and the value it carried.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d she ultimately confessed.\n\n\n\nPhone calls, store visits, solicitations, holding that sign like a lunatic. Nothing would bring me the opportunity to spend bitcoin.\nI left Woot Bear \u2014 the coincidental significance of its name including \u201cbear\u201d only now starting to register \u2014 with my confidence in disrepair. Still, I tried a few more shops to no avail and had an encounter that I won\u2019t recount here for fear of being put on an FBI watch list.\nStopping to record what just happened (and clueing my buddies in \u2014 we have a running tally on surreal encounters), I was interrupted by an older, flustered, Indian man.\n\u201cIs that you?\u201d he asked, pointing to my sign as it rested on the shop\u2019s sandwich-board sign.\nThinking he was interested in my sign (he was the first person to stop to read it), I enthusiastically replied in the affirmative.\n\u201cWell, stop it. This is my sign, my shop.\u201d The man gestured at the storefront.\n\u201cOh, sorry, I was just typing something up \u2014 just using your sign for a second.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I don\u2019t care if you need it for a minute,\u201d he said as he stepped farther out on the sidewalk, seemingly to monitor my loitering.\nWalking to the panhandle of Golden Gate Park, I was resigned to not finding anywhere on Haight that would take bitcoin, but not to finding nowhere that would take it.\nPosted up on a bench outside a public basketball court, I called up a few places I had left to check with.\nNothing.\nThey\u2019d all stopped taking bitcoin some time ago. A tone of brisk agitation usually followed my questions.\nFrustrated, I gave up. The constant Google queries, calls and typing \u2014 all my activity had been eating into my phone\u2019s battery \u2014 with hunger eating at my concentration: I\u2019d had enough. My phone was at 5 percent, so I called an Uber and retreated to the apartment.\nI\u2019m typing this in the Uber and it\u2019s honestly hard to focus with this empty burning in my gut.\nSan Francisco\u2019s roller coaster landscape didn\u2019t help. Most of what I wrote in the Uber was crap.\nBack at the apartment, I ordered Curry Up Now again. The deconstructed samosas and sexy fries were very much a transcendent experience, probably both because they were undeniably delicious and because my stomach was ready to turn in on itself.\nI was fed, but I wasn\u2019t satisfied. My pact was broken: I couldn\u2019t use bitcoin in any stores or restaurants, and the reality was becoming very clear that I likely wouldn\u2019t get the chance.\nI wasn\u2019t thriving like I would have hoped \u2014 or really expected. Sure, saying I\u2019ve been surviving wouldn\u2019t be quite right, because it\u2019s been unequivocally easy to use Bitrefill to get more Uber credit. But there\u2019s no diversity in purchases, just travel and food. Not only have I not been able to spend it in the city, but I haven\u2019t been able to experience the different ways that I could spend it.\nFrustrated and disappointed, I watched the Saints play (and beat) the Eagles in the NFC division round and wrote a little more. Another night of being fed by a friend, as Michelle cooked risotto and had her folks over.\nBefore dinner was served, I heard Michelle talk about the experiment with them. Her mother took to the topic with quick fascination but diagnosed the potential difficulties with it.\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s going to be tough, but if he can do it anywhere, it would be here,\u201d her mom said.\nLet me tell ya, lady \u2014 you have no idea.\n\n\nColin's adventures continue...find out what happens on Day 4 here.\nAs Kashmir Hill did in her original journey, Colin is accepting BTC tips to help him along the way.\nTip jar: 3CnLhqitCjUN4HPYf6Qa2MmvCpSoBiFfBN\nColin is an associate editor and staff writer for Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0 He's proud to call Nashville his home, where he lives with his family and doesn't eat hot chicken as much as you might think.\u00a0\n", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 17}

Another company executive also received a sentence of two years for his role in these crimes.\nThe report claims that Komid fabricated over 5 million accounts to falsify trade orders and drum up fake volume. The scam allowed the executives to net roughly $44M (50 billion won) in fees from trades that were executed against the fake orders. This figure doesn\u2019t take into account the business the exchange might have generated from extra, legitimate customers they might have attracted by posting these fraudulent figures.\nThe judge stated that CEO Hyunsuk Choi \u201chas repeatedly committed fraud for many unspecified number of victims for a long period of time,\u201d and expressed concern about possible ramifications on public confidence in the industry.\nKomid is not the only Korean company to have been involved in scandal recently, as UPbit also saw its executives arrested on similar charges of artificial inflation.\nAs reported in the Korea Times, these arrests involved not only the direct operators of the exchange itself, but also its parent company, Dunamu.\nAccording to the Korea Times, \u201ctwo top-level officers and one employee of UPbit, including Dunamu\u2019s board director chairman surnamed Song\u201d were indicted on these charges, as these falsified exchange numbers allowed UPbit to rake in more than 120 billion won ($106.8 million).\nThe prosecutors have evidently discovered two severe instances of this volume falsification, dating from October to December of 2017, and then again on December 18, 2018. Allegedly, the executives of UPbit used a bot program to falsify some 254 trillion won ($225 billion) worth of trades.\nOfficials at UPbit, for their part, have completely denied these allegations. In their public statement, they claimed that they \u201chave provided liquidity to [their] corporate account and have not benefited or traded in this process,\u201d adding that during the period of October to December 2017, \u201cthe company provided liquidity to the company\u2019s corporate account in order to stabilize the trading market at the beginning of the service opening.\u201d\nThe Korea Times indicated that none of the accused parties at UPbit has been taken into police custody yet.\nProsecutors in South Korea are well-accustomed to dealing with all manner of scams and fraudulent activities in their nation\u2019s crypto space. Not only is their closest neighbor, North Korea, a direct sponsor of some of the most ambitious crypto-hacking groups, but it has also been scant weeks since the last time a South Korean exchange made headlines for defrauding its millions of customers.", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 22}

Find out what happened to him earlier on Day 1 , on Day 2 , on Day 3 and on Day 4.\nI woke up in a millionaire\u2019s bed today, something I never thought I\u2019d say because I ain\u2019t gonna make a million bucks, and I always doubted I could\u2019ve finagled my way into the bed of someone who had.\nJeremy\u2019s room is your prototypical festival bro living space: Bob Marley poster in one corner, jam band festival posters for Camp Bisco and Gathering of the Vibes (among other music festivals) tacked above a 50-inch, Toshiba plasma screen, which was leaning against the wall and propped up on the box it came in. A tangled cluster of conference passes (many speaker or VIP) hung from a back wall above the felt loveseat.\nBelow one of the room\u2019s three windows, there\u2019s a bookcase sectioned off into six cubbies, which include Hunter S. Thompson, Michael Lewis, Truman Capote, and some self-help and econ/business books. Almost poetically, a book called Ego is the Enemy appropriately placed in a cubbie diagonally opposite to the one housing Tucker Max\u2019s Assholes Finish First.\n\n\n\nOn the third floor, I made the coffee I bought at Whole Foods, warmed one of the croissants and did some work.\nOver Slack, my colleague Aaron van Wirdum suggested I try a map called Bitcoin Map on the Google Play store to see if it had any bitcoin-accepting places listed that I could be missing. I pulled it up, browsed some places I had previously tried but knew no longer did. Then, I glanced at Haight-Ashbury on the map one last time and noticed a smoke shop and one-time hookah lounge that accepted bitcoin.\nOn the off chance, I called them up.\n\u201cDo you guys still accept bitcoin?\u201d\n\u201cYes, we do.\u201d\n\u201cSeriously?!\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nExuberant, I let a triumphant expletive slip and thanked the woman, assuring her that I would be by later that day.\nIt would be a smoke shop that becomes the first place where I can spend some bitcoin, I thought to myself.\nWith that victory, my spirits were lifted and I began to make preparations for my day. Needing to get more credit for Uber, I tried out Gyft, a gift card purchasing platform that made Hill\u2019s second run at this in 2014 so much easier. Vinny Lingham started it, and the platform accepts other forms of payment than just bitcoin.\nI couldn\u2019t use it though. I tried to buy an Uber gift card, but my Samourai wallet wouldn\u2019t accept the BitPay QR as valid (which, given Samourai\u2019s general crypto maximalism, made sense and also seemed to sum up the difficulties of the experiment to that point). I opted for Bitrefill again.\nThen I started doing some research on Kraken and Coinbase\u2019s locations in San Francisco. According to Google, they have the same office address, which I found odd.\nPutting the address into my Uber app, I decided to make my way to the heart of San Francisco\u2019s Financial District to see if I could pester my way into either or both offices. \u201cJust show up and ask to talk to people,\u201d Hill\u2019s advice echoed in my head.\nThe addresses I got on Google led me to a mailing address, but then a bit of sleuthing got me addresses (supposedly) of the actual offices for both Kraken and Coinbase. Kraken\u2019s, though, turned out to be a FedEx, which led me to think that my informant was screwing with me or that Kraken had registered that address intentionally so as to not be bothered.\nCoinbase\u2019s office was right, so I cut the informant some slack. I secured a receptionist\u2019s number from the security desk in the lobby but didn\u2019t really have time to make an appointment for later. This wasn\u2019t 2013 anymore: I couldn\u2019t just drop in on their three employees in an apartment office anymore. This was 2019 and Coinbase had become a unicorn with more than 500 employees and six offices in three countries.\n\n\n\nThe rain was light but steady when I was searching for Kraken and Coinbase\u2019s offices, but it would come down progressively harder the longer I walked. I passed a Target on my route in which I could have bought an umbrella (Paxful and Gyft have Target cards), and it highlighted a problem with banking on bitcoin through gift cards. You have to preplan your purchases, or else you have to stop, connect to wifi, and use an exchange that takes bitcoin to buy new cards before you can redeem them.\nIt seems obvious, but it\u2019s not as seamless as cash, debit or credit. Even so, there aren\u2019t so many hoops to jump through \u2014 just enough to make doing so outside in the rain an inconvenience.\nMy denim jacket was thoroughly soaked, so I stopped inside a Starbucks and ordered a coffee with a Starbucks gift card I bought on Paxful. I ordered a seasonal latte, basic white boy that I am, but I had the barista only pump about a third of the usual flavor shots into it because I don\u2019t like drinking syrup.\nWhile downtown, I visited Quantstamp\u2019s offices, as Christian had set me up with a buddy of his who worked there, Jared let me in and we talked crypto. He mentioned a bubble tea cafe nearby that used to accept crypto, but it proved to be yet another red herring, making me worry that maybe the smoke shop on Haight might not either.\nUbering back to the castle, I sent some additional funds to my Samourai wallet ahead of my trip to the shop. Rachel wanted to come along, partly I think for the fun of it but also because she was fiending for some Juul pods and was banking on my generosity to secure her some.\nWe reached the smoke shop shortly before close as one employee was busy allocating merch to a back closet. It was what you expected from a smoke shop: pieces, bongs and actual tobacco pipes in various sizes and in a motley of translucent, glass-infused colors. They sell smokes and vaping supplies too, but no Juuls or Juul pods (to Rachel\u2019s great dismay).\nApproaching the counter, I try to confirm what I\u2019d been told over the phone.\n\u201cY\u2019all take bitcoin, right?\u201d\n\u201cBitcoin? Yes, I think,\u201d said the middle-aged, Asian woman, hesitantly. \u201cWe used to at least. Ask him,\u201d she says, pointing to the man stacking the backroom with inventory.\nHer husband, a middle-aged, white guy with glasses, a mariner\u2019s cap and close-shaven beard, who looks like he might read communist theory and know his way around a VPN, dashed my bitcoin-spending hopes with his answer.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Honey, do we still have the payment processor?\u201d he asked.\nThey didn\u2019t. Snapcard, which may have very well been the same defunct-processor that Woot Bear used, was no longer in service, so they stopped taking it some time ago. They had originally decided to start accepting bitcoin in 2013-2014 when it was \u201ccool\u201d to do so, and the husband was kicking himself for not doing it sooner.\n\u201cPeople would want to come in and buy rolling papers and we didn\u2019t want to take it, which was stupid,\u201d he chuckled.\nI asked if they still had a Coinbase account to which I could send bitcoin, but the wife said that her son held the account and they didn\u2019t know how to use it. After a few more failed attempts at trying to find a solution, I gave up, thanked them and left the shop.\nAs I left, I was convinced there was some grand conspiracy to keep me from spending bitcoin, until the woman peeked her head out of the shop to beckon us back.\n\u201cI think we figured it out,\u201d she said.\nEager and a bit antsy, I leaned over the counter to observe her Coinbase app while I tried for the items I had picked out (a glass piece that\u2019s totally not for me and white sage for the castle). As it turned out, they weren\u2019t verified with Coinbase, so they could only buy/sell on Coinbase and not send/receive. This annoyed me: Why do one when you can\u2019t do the other?\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok,\u201d I said, resigned at this point.\nBut the woman insisted. She was nice enough to let me just scan the QR code for her son\u2019s wallet, and she even gave me a five buck discount on the piece.\nEffusive, I thanked them and asked for their names, which they prefered I not publish here. Apparently, San Francisco is not too friendly to tobacco shops.\n\u201cThe city is trying to annex the smoke shops,\u201d the husband told me. That coupled with the stigma of bitcoin and the illicit drug market\u2019s symbiotic dependence on the dark web (and the fact that the business is basically a head shop) made them wary enough of potentially damaging publicity.\nThe fact that the transaction almost happened then didn\u2019t, only to almost not happen and then succeed was representative of how the experiment has been panning out so far. The bitcoin PoS was makeshift, but it finally happened, and I was happy enough to finally get the first IRL transaction out of the way, even if it came on day five. It was also directly peer-to-peer \u2014 no middleman payment processor involved, which I liked.\nFinally, something to write home about.\n\n\n\nReturning to the castle, I would spend the rest of the night fraternizing with the residents who were quickly becoming acquaintances and friends. They all had their own goals and projects, and the interactions in my short time with them will be worth a story one day.\nThere\u2019s Rachel, who\u2019s known Jeremy since 2015; Liz, the Queen of the Castle (obviously); Michael, a laid back relations or community manager who \u201ckinda does crypto but not really;\u201d Orest and Aymard, who work at Ausum Ventures with Jeremy; Teddy and Hans, who are building a blockchain query database for legal documents; Vivian, the VP of the same self-driving car startup, comma.ai, that used to reside in the castle\u2019s basement; and a prodigious, 18-year-old developer-entrepreneur who runs his own AI financial consultation startup and whom Jeremy referred to once as his \u201cprot\u00e9g\u00e9.\u201d\n\u201cSo, are you like the wunderkind developer prodigy of the house?\u201d I asked him.\n\u201cPretty much. But it\u2019s not just that.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, like you\u2019re also the wunderkind entrepreneurial prodigy?\u201d\n\u201cSomething like that,\u201d he responded with a smile and honest innocence.\nHe told me he would rather not be identified in the article because the banks and other businesses he works with don\u2019t know that he\u2019s still a kid, he confessed. That he had operated so long without them finding out was astounding to me.\nThe Prodigy began his company when he was a freshman in high school. No, not college (he never took that road), high school. In the company\u2019s early stages, he decided to go all in on his vision.\n\u201cSo I pretty much left high school.\u201d\nNo diploma or degree to speak of, he moved to San Francisco when he was 15. In what would have been his sophomore year, he was focused on driving business growth while his peers were testing for learner\u2019s permits.\nAn early investor in Ethereum and a sometimes crypto-head, he met Jeremy at a crypto castle party in 2017, and Jeremy would take him under his wing and offer him a home.\nNow he works out of the community surrounded by the advice and the tutelage of the castle\u2019s residents, who, while still young entrepreneurs themselves, have plenty of experience and tips to impart to the kid.\nI highlighted The Prodigy here because or his age and precociousness but also because the whiz-tech kid who eschews education in favor of just doing makes for a pretty good story. Realistically, I could have profiled some of the other residents and their endeavors as well (for instance, I plan on doing an article on some of the innovative, impactful startups Ausum Ventures has invested in).\nBut The Prodigy particularly personified the house\u2019s ethos: driven, focused, entrepreneurial and hardworking.\n\u201cDo you do drugs or drink?\u201d I asked him.\n\u201cNo. Never.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Don\u2019t,\u201d I advised him.\nTruth is, considering the portrait of the millionaire party boy that has been painted of Jeremy in the past, the castle was nothing like that. It wasn\u2019t like the mainstream coverage would imply: no end-to-end daily benders or booze-infused ragers. I don\u2019t think anyone even touched a drink while I was there.

Find out what happened to him earlier on Day 1 , on Day 2 , on Day 3 , onDay 4 and on Day 5.\nOn day six I woke with a renewed sense of energy. My last two days in San Francisco were booked up with plenty to do, and yesterday\u2019s purchase had reinvigorated the experiment\u2019s sense of purpose.\nThat morning I wrote, paid Kashmir back for the breakfast (she got into her Coinbase account) and set out for two days of Bay Area shenanigans that would include meeting a local crypto artist, getting tipsy with bitcoin and sleeping (and sailing) in the East Bay on a boat that threatened to capsize.\n\n\n\nAround 1:00 p.m. I caught an Uber into the Financial District to meet up with Dustin, a multi-talented developer who had responded to a Reddit thread I made leading up to my week here. He invited me sailing, but the weather was sketchy \u2014 it had been raining for the better part of my time in San Francisco and there were winds and storms in the forecast \u2014 so we decided to meet at Digital Garage, a coworking space on Market Street that accommodates many cryptocurrency projects.\nI was loitering in the lobby when he passed me, and we registered who the other was immediately. Big, tall, bearded with long, blonde hair, a tremendous smile and goofy disposition, he crossed from the other end of the lobby to greet me.\nHe\u2019s got the hair, the beard, the \u201cNo worries, dude\u201d vibe. We\u2019re going to get along great.\nWe did.\nAs we entered the working space, I was pleased to see a cryptograffiti original on prominent display, which added an air of authenticity to both his presence in the space and to the San Francisco crypto community for supporting a local, industry-specific artist.\nPosting up at a table in the working space, we hit it off and began jumping from one crypto topic to the next. Turns out, he\u2019s a lone-wolf dev who\u2019s building a hardware wallet with bluetooth-enabled mobile controls \u2014 not unlike Ledger\u2019s own Nano X, I suggested. He hadn\u2019t heard of it before.\n\u201cWell, they might have the bluetooth, but I doubt it\u2019s trustless and multi-sig,\u201d he tells me, going on to say that he knows of no other trustless hardware wallet. Interest piqued, I surveyed his app and the hardware wallet prototype, which he\u2019s also building himself.\n\u201cYou\u2019re just a one-man band, aren\u2019t ya?\u201d I remarked, impressed, after learning that he was building everything himself.\nHe\u2019s a bit of a crypto OG, it seems. He\u2019s been in the space since 2011 and hangs around the Bitcoin Core internet relay chat (IRC), where he says he\u2019s been humbled on a few occasions. I asked for his veteran perspective to help explain why I couldn\u2019t find any more stores in the area that accept bitcoin. He suggests that it\u2019s intertwined in the same trend that has made Silicon Valley so banal to him.\n\u201cBitcoin has really exacerbated the aspects of Silicon Valley I don\u2019t like,\u201d he admits. \u201cIt has an appreciation for altcoins or stablecoins, but not really for bitcoin, hard money. I think there\u2019s this culture in San Francisco that just idolizes what investors like, what\u2019s new. I heard someone say Silicon Valley is about new things \u2014 bitcoin isn\u2019t new anymore.\u201d\nEveryone\u2019s just looking for \u201cthe next big thing\u201d or \u201cthe next Bitcoin.\u201d They\u2019re not going to find it, was more or less his view, and he believes that the focus shouldn\u2019t be creating something new but improving what we already have.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard it said that the East Coast owns things while the West Coast makes things,\u201d he theorized, \u201cand if that stereotype were true I could see more people taking bitcoin.\n\u201cI think the challenge is that the majority of people don\u2019t understand security stuff. The people who buy these don\u2019t understand half of it. The challenge is teaching them,\u201d he said, broaching the evergreen topic on the \u201chow-tos\u201d of adoption.\nOur conversation was kinetic and animated as we touched on a wide range of crypto-related topics. I\u2019m not surrounded by developers much in Nashville (especially not crypto/blockchain ones), so the opportunity to talk to one who knew the ins-and-outs (and knew them real well) left my curiosity welling with streams of new, if half-hatched, bitcoin applications and infrastructural ideas.\nWe talked crypto assets insurance (a concept which we both had previously hatched complementary business models for), his conceptualization that the network serves users and not miners (he believes that \u201chashing wars\u201d are irrelevant, since, ultimately, the users will decide which chain they buy in to) and his surprising penchant for interacting with some of the space\u2019s most prodigious and controversial celebrities without knowing who they are.\nAt one point, he had left his laptop at the Crypto Castle only to retrieve it, unmolested, from the same couch he left it on a month later, though he didn\u2019t really know who Jeremy was. I brought up Brock Pierce and his benevolent-or-parasitic (depends on who you ask) ventures in Puerto Rico. When Dustin was still involved in the Valley\u2019s tech party scene, he was acquainted with him before either even knew about bitcoin.\n\u201cOhhh, that\u2019s Brock Pierce. I know him \u2014 I just didn\u2019t know his name. We used to party a lot 10 years ago. That\u2019s hilarious.\u201d\nEveryone knows everyone in this industry, and the degrees of separation between connections is often slim. It\u2019s like Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon but with Bitcoin.\nHe would reaffirm this observation throughout our talks. For instance, he had applied for Coinbase back in 2013, a job he didn\u2019t end up getting \u2014 though Armstrong\u2019s consolation prize was pretty nice.\n\u201cHe gave me a bitcoin,\u201d he said, smiling and holding up his hands like he was holding something ethereal. \u201cIt was like 34 bucks then.\u201d\nThe literal token of gratitude for being one of Coinbase\u2019s first applicants.\nThat would have been sometime in 2013, maybe even right before Hill\u2019s article. Funny, he was probably up for the position of Coinbase\u2019s third employee.\n\n\n\nI ordered some pad thai for lunch on Uber Eats, tried to manage some work but was ultimately distracted by my on-going, engaging conversations with Dustin. He\u2019d agreed to go with me to the Bitcoin meetup at Stookey\u2019s that night. To kill time until then, we decided we would give BitPay an office visit. I wanted to ask them about the decreasing presence of bitcoin-accepting merchants in the bay area, and see if the trend was national and global.\nI called the office but only succeeded in leaving a voicemail, so we decided that running the errand on foot would give us our best shot. BitPay has two offices listed on Google. One was, no doubt, a mailing address but we had no way of figuring out which one.\nThe rain-soaked walk was made easier thanks to our umbrellas (Hans had graciously loaned me his, a feeble but functional black pocket umbrella). On our way, we took a detour so that I could try out a bitcoin ATM.\nThe experience wasn\u2019t as gratifying as I had hoped, mainly because it didn\u2019t feel like actually buying bitcoin \u2014 it was more like buying credit or a coupon for bitcoin, the opposite of what I had been doing all week: using bitcoin to buy credit and coupons in the form of gift cards.\nThe Coinme ATM was located in something of a mall a block over from the Moscone Center. I decided to use cash, but upon using the machine, any chance of anonymity was promptly thwarted.\nFirst, it asks you to insert your ID, followed by a request to take a picture to verify that identity (that I would have to basically do know-your-customer (KYC) verifications twice to buy bitcoin with cash was anathema to me). After this it asked me for my phone number and email address, which I found ironically less intrusive after having to be photo identified. When all this was done, it printed a slip of paper with a username and password, along with a URL at which I could access the $10 worth of bitcoin I had bought.\nCool, I can\u2019t even access it yet and don\u2019t even hold the keys. Certainly different from when Hill used a makeshift, trustless prototype at Internet Archives in 2013 before the first crypto ATMs had been produced. Back then, it was just a computer and a cash box, which any employee could use to withdraw or deposit bitcoin for cash. Same concept, but more anonymous, easy and endearingly janky (you had to trust people not to steal cash from it, though).\nThe disheartening and borderline frustrating experience (it felt a bit cheap, a normal monetary transaction service masquerading as a crypto one) was aggravated when a Ramen vending machine 20 yards away teased cryptocurrency as a purchasing option, only to qualify the payment as \u201cComing soon!\u201d at checkout.\nWe went on with our search for BitPay, but it was ultimately fruitless. At the first location, our call on the building\u2019s outside directory went unanswered. At the second, we were told that BitPay no longer occupied space in the building, so we decided to pack it in.\nFighting the wind that had whipped up in our mile or so walk, we took refuge in an Chinese food joint that Dustin was fond of. We split a helping of kung pao chicken, which I repaid in bitcoin. Dustin had become an IRL intermediary through which I could enjoy those elusive dining-in-with-bitcoin experiences.\n\n\n\nDinner finished, we found our way to Stookey\u2019s, an intimate, cooly lit bar that could comfortably seat maybe 30 people. We were fashionably late and took a seat at the rightmost end of the bar. I was unpleasantly unsurprised to discover that no one else had shown up for the meetup yet. For the first 30 minutes, we were the only ones, it seemed, a disappointing situation that was becoming par for the course in a week of almosts.\nBut it was also a win. I got to spend my bitcoin again, this time on a delicious pisco sour (a Peruvian, egg-white cocktail with a pisco base, bitters and limes) and enough beer and other cocktails to get a buzz on and cringe at the thought that the prices were not too far off from Nashville\u2019s own.\nStriking up a conversation with a wispy black-haired guy who \u201cis kinda a tech geek,\u201d Dustin asked him if he was there for the meetup. He said no, admitting that he was a bit skeptical of the whole thing. He rehashed an old misperception that I\u2019ve heard from numerous naysayers, and the fact that I\u2019m forgetting it now is either a testament to the cocktails\u2019 potency or to the fact that most arguments against bitcoin (especially from the underinformed) have all been packaged into a nebulous hodgepodge of complaints that, in their ubiquity, have begun to resemble each other).\nDustin and I hit it off with one of the bartenders, who showed a greater-than-average understanding of crypto \u2014 so much so that he had educated opinions on forks, proof of work vs. proof of stake, and Ethereum\u2019s Constantinople upgrade. He\u2019s been invested for two-and-a-half years, though he had been tuned into the market and started conducting due diligence two years before that.\nI asked if any of the crypto-focused co-owners were around so I could grill them. One of them, a close friend of his, was sojourning in Mexico, as one does when crypto rich. Our bartender was a more-than-adequate stand-in for my questions, seeing as he\u2019d been at the bar for two years, so I asked him if he\u2019d noticed a drop-off in Bitcoin meetup interest.\n\u201cThey go up and down. We\u2019re in between,\u201d he said, conceding that they had been considering scaling the meetups down from weekly to quarterly.\nHe also shared his personal experience of the hassles that come with accepting bitcoin, particularly in times of network bloat. \u201cFees were getting ridiculous on BitPay,\u201d he told me. \u201cA $14 cocktail becomes a $24 cocktail and people don\u2019t want to pay.\u201d\n\u201cHow many people pay in bitcoin, would you say?\u201d I asked him.\n\u201cA few, mostly during the meetups obviously. Every now and then, someone will be a few drinks in, realize we take it and then want to pay that way.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter about an hour, I turned to my left to observe a room whose patronage had thinned out in tandem with the vanishing contents of our glasses. With the room cleared, I could make out two dudes having an enlivened conversation two seats down from us: one, tall and thin-ish; the other, shorter and bulky, with blond hair.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s Dan Held,\u201d I told Dustin, referring to the blond character. True to form, Dustin didn\u2019t seem to know who Dan was, showing the willful introversion of a man who is more preoccupied with the code of the industry over its personalities.\nI went over and introduced myself, thanking Dan for an op-ed he had recently submitted to Bitcoin Magazine and telling him a bit about my experiment. I related it back to Kashmir Hill\u2019s own, where he was featured in the final day of her 2014 excursion.\nDan invited me to get coffee the next day, but I said it would be tricky given my schedule. I would be busy in the morning and evening, and I had plans to meet up with cryptograffiti, a San Francisco-based crypto artist, in the afternoon.\nHe gave a half-cocked smile and nodded to the man he had been talking with.\n\u201cNo way, seriously?\u201d I said, shocked at the serendipity.\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s me,\u201d the tall man responded with a grin.\nWith introductions made, we talked a bit, and I learned (not to any surprise) that the artist was a maximalist of sorts.\n\u201cBitcoin is my baby,\u201d he said with the simultaneous seriousness and self-aware waggishness of a true believer.\nLike Dustin, cryptograffiti was an OG. Always jumping at the chance to glean another point of view, I relayed the frustrations that had obstructed my week on bitcoin, and I asked why there were so few people at the meetup.\n\u201cPeople stopped going to meetups because the focus had changed. It was too financial. People started shutting you down if you knew what you were saying,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s all wrapped up in the paradigm shift the crypto community has experienced since 2013, he believes. Like Dustin, he thinks the altcoin boom exposed how mercurial community attention can be and diverted much of the excitement for bitcoin toward the industry\u2019s new and shiny offspring.\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool to be contrarian. Everyone is looking for the next thing.\u201d\nDustin joined the conversation, along with another meetup latecomer: a short, spiky-haired Ethereum \u201cmoon boy\u201d with wide, distant eyes whom I had met at the conference and who claimed he had conceptualized a \u201cdecentralized, global supercomputer\u201d in high school before Ethereum had even existed.\nSure thing, bud.\nThe meetup, while small, felt profound. It was small, but it was also quality and included a diverse sample of the industry\u2019s many players. It was eclectic and intimate, much like the \u201cBitcoin at $100\u201d meetup that Hill was a part of. Only ours was smaller, something I would not have anticipated when I started this.\nBut there was probably a greater diversity of professional specializations in the industry at this meetup: a one-man developer team who seemed to personify Bitcoin\u2019s open-source nature, a Texas boy who had become one of the crypto space\u2019s most recognized entrepreneurs, a San Francisco-based DJ-turned-artist whose crypto-themed artwork sells for five figures (yes, really), a Nashville-based journalist who didn\u2019t know squat about Bitcoin until 2017 and was thrilled just to worm his way into this milieu, and the Ethereum moon boy who did brand relations for an Ethereum-built project.\nBitcoin and crypto had all given us the opportunity to pursue passions and careers within the industry.\nEven if its use as an IRL payment has regressed, the impact of the network has been far reaching \u2014 the industry is more active than ever. This thought enlivened me.\n\n\n\nDustin had offered me a bed on his boat for the night, something I wasn\u2019t about to pass up, especially with a few drinks in me. It was across the way in Berkeley, so we took the BART. I paid Dustin for a ticket and then a 15-minute drive from Oakland put us at the harbor.\nThe boat\u2019s exterior gave the impression of a modest and relatively well-maintained sailboat. Below deck, the haphazard displacement of various sundries and provisions presented the habitat of a man who probably had the madness to create things few people could.\nThe night winding down, we decided to watch/play Black Mirror\u2019s Bandersnatch on Netflix. The choose-your-own-adventure movie\u2019s interactive nature gives a new dimension to Black Mirror\u2019s typical rabbit-hole examination of technology and human frailty. We had both watched it before and wanted to see what different endings we could get.\nEven if tenuous, the connection between the protagonist's struggle to create a choose-your-own-adventure game (it\u2019s also glaringly meta, like a lot of Black Mirror\u2019s concepts) in the seminal days of the video game industry and my own struggle to spend bitcoin became apparent.\nWhat alternative endings, universes, paths had I not confronted, found or gone down in the course of my own adventure? Maybe I\u2019d missed some opportunities where I could\u2019ve used my bitcoin. Or maybe this was the most optimal path: I had met Held and cryptograffiti at a meetup and was about to sleep on a boat, owned by a developer whose myriad and disparate interests and lifestyle were like something out of a book.\nWhat other endings are out there? I thought to myself, the boat gently rocking to the bay\u2019s swaying tide.\nIt was an easy and comfortable sleep.\n\n\n\nColin's adventures continue...find out what happens on the last day of his Living on Bitcoin experiment here.\nAs Kashmir Hill did in her original journey, Colin is accepting BTC tips to help him along the way.\nTip jar: 3CnLhqitCjUN4HPYf6Qa2MmvCpSoBiFfBN\nColin is an associate editor and staff writer for Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0 He's proud to call Nashville his home, where he lives with his family and doesn't eat hot chicken as much as you might think.\u00a0\n", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 22}

It includes a wallet, an e-commerce plug-in, a hardware component for a point-of-sale (PoS) terminal, a Lightning node for the new ecosystem and developer tools.\nFor starters, the open-source, cross-platform Peach wallet has all the bells and whistles of your usual Lightning wallet, \u201cincluding: custom channel opening; the ability to send and receive on-chain and LN payments; and merchant discovery,\u201d Pavel Prikhodko, head of Lightning Peach, told Bitcoin Magazine. Users can establish custom channels with a Lightning public address and the host IP of a peer, and the wallet also comes with a self-curated address book and an option to send recurring/subscription payments.\n\u201cWe continue to investigate ways to streamline the user experience, and we soon plan to present an updated wallet that makes it even more simple for people to use,\u201d Prikhodko continued.\nUsers can connect to Peach Node, Bitfury\u2019s Lightning Network node, with their own nodes or wallets to create payment channels in the Peach ecosystem. Connected to this node, any user will be able to send payments to any other user on the network regardless if they already have an existing channel, while you can still send invoices for payments to wallets that aren\u2019t connected to the node as well.\nThe suite\u2019s two merchant components, Peach Commerce and Peach Terminal, are complementary tools built for e-commerce and PoS transactions.\nCommerce can be integrated both as a PoS plug-in for merchants and as an API for payment processors to include in their backend. Asking Prikhodko what made the solution so \u201cseamless,\u201d as stated in the press release, he told me that it will automate the Lightning payments process to simplify it for the less technically inclined.\n\u201cThe solution automatically handles channel capacity, connection with hubs and payment routing, and it integrates easily into existing e-commerce solutions, so the merchant doesn\u2019t have to worry or even be aware of these things.\u201d\nOut the gate, the plugin will work with Prestashop, with WooCommerce and Magento soon to follow.\nTerminal, Prikhodko said, was built with \u201cbroader wallet cross-compatibility in mind.\u201d The hardware component can be integrated into the PoS systems for storefronts and even vending machines, and it supports connections through Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, mini HDMI and USB OTG ports.\nAfter being asked what kind of flexibility the multiple avenues of connection would give the hardware, especially with Bluetooth, Prikhodko answered:\n\u201cA community-wide discussion is yet to happen around the best way forward to standardize the use of NFC and Bluetooth in the context of Lightning. However, Peach Terminal is using the standard Invoice Protocol as defined in the BOLT-11 specification. It\u2019s our hope that more bitcoin wallet developers will follow our lead and enable NFC and Bluetooth Lightning payments in the nearest future.\u201d\nBitfury\u2019s Peach suite follows a year of rapid expansion and development for the Lightning Network. As the network\u2019s bitcoin capacity and users grow by the day, developers from various labs and incubators continue to make headway on new applications, products and tools for its users. Prikhodko believes that merchants want to use a payment solution like Lightning for their business, if they have an easier way to do it, that is.\n\u201cMerchants want a new payment method if it provides fast and easy transactions that drive new customers. Lightning makes it easier for merchants to accept bitcoin by enabling instant payments and minimal transaction fees. The scalability that the Lightning Network enables is essential if we want more merchants to begin accepting bitcoin payments. The currently missing piece in the ecosystem is a merchant solution that hides all the operational complexity of the network behind a clean, user-friendly, and reliable merchant product that enables a new payment method and drives new business at no extra financial or behavioral cost.\u201d", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 23}
{"title": "BloqLabs Introduces Cryptocurrency Mining Management System", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bloqlabs-introduces-cryptocurrency-mining-management-system/", "birthday": "Jan 23, 2019  12:12 PM EST", "date": "2019-01-23 17:12:00", "content": "Jimmy has been following the development of blockchain for several years, and he is optimistic about its potential to democratize the financial system.\n\nBloqLabs has opened up the beta waitlist for Titan, a fully integrated software suite for managing cryptocurrency mining. The project was introduced by Bloq CEO and co-founder Jeff Garzik onstage during a brief speech at Binance Fair in Singapore in an overview discussion of BloqLabs.\nCryptocurrency mining can be profitable but optimizing and managing devices manually can be a pain-point for miners. From tweaking the power limit of the GPU to fixing the downtime problem at the moment it happens, these are just some of the difficulties crypto miners have to contend with when mining cryptocurrencies.\nIn an email correspondence with Bitcoin Magazine, principal blockchain engineer at Bloq and CEO of Titan, Ryan Condron, said Titan is the result of years of developing tools to manage their company's mining farms. Along with Titan's CTO, Kyle Howlett, the team believes they have found a way to help businesses maximize their ROI on mining.\n\"In the process of developing tools to manage our mining farms, we\u2019ve gotten very good at fingerprinting various types of mining devices once they are plugged into a network,\u201d said Condron. \u201cThen, given our understanding of what makes these devices function optimally, we\u2019ve written ways to interface with the device\u2019s firmware. Pull all of that into a single interface, and you have a very powerful tool.\"\nThe Titan software is free to download, and it can be installed and set up immediately on a network of mining devices. Once configured, the developer said Titan would balance the entire mining variables needed to deliver maximum profitability to the miner.\n\"This means adjusting for mining difficulty, coin prices, electricity costs, and so on. And, yes, it learns as it goes,\" Condron explained.\nCoupled with machine learning capabilities, Condron claims Titan can increase or decrease the hash power of mining farms by double digits, if configured correctly.\nOne way is by overclocking the GPU, where the internal clock rate is increased so that the chip can run faster. According to Condron, Titan can also leverage other factors like \"maximizing uptime across the entire mining farm, temperature (internal and external) optimization, and smart electricity throttling\" to optimize the mining devices.\nThe crypto market downturn has dragged with it some heavyweights of the crypto mining sector. One such example is China-based mining giant Bitmain, who has whittled down its activities across the world, shutting down several of its overseas offices and restructuring its operations. This unsettled mining environment could pose a conundrum for Titan, whose product is coming at a time when the mining morale is low. Condron, however, sees an opportunity.\n\"Titan has a powerful value proposition for miners who have scaled down their operations during the market downturn. Titan will help them ensure they are mining the most profitable coin, as well as maximize the useful life of their capital equipment and manage both fixed (e.g., headcount) and variable (e.g., electricity) operational costs,\" he explained.\nTitan's beta version is targeted at a specific market of miners \u2014 medium\u2013 to large-scale miners who still rely on a manual process to manage the performance of their mining equipment.\nThe current software can work with devices that mine bitcoin, litecoin, ether, zcash, dash and monero. Additional crypto tokens should be rolled out before the beta release. The Titan software suite of products will be free to use, but Titan will receive a percentage of the proceeds derived from Titan-optimized hashrates.", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 23}
{"title": "Elections Canada Consults With Political Parties on Crypto Donations", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/elections-canada-consults-political-parties-crypto-donations/", "birthday": "Jan 23, 2019  12:25 PM EST", "date": "2019-01-23 17:25:00", "content": "@WILLMS_\nAccording to Elections Canada, the agency that runs federal elections in Canada, there has been \u201ca growing interest\u201d in cryptocurrency donations. This trend has prompted some political parties to ask for a ruling on how best to manage bitcoin and other cryptocurrency political donations and how to navigate the various reporting systems required by both Elections Canada and the parties so that they comply with the Canada Elections Act.\nElection season is just beginning in Canada. There are three federal by-elections called for February 25, 2019; these will fill vacant seats, including a seat for one of the party leaders. A full federal election will be called before October 21, 2019.\nOn the legality of accepting cryptocurrency donations, an Elections Canada (EC) official told Bitcoin Magazine that \u201cthe Canada Elections Act does not prohibit political entities from accepting cryptocurrency contributions. Political entities are therefore currently able to accept such contributions.\u201d\nElections Canada is taking the initial position that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are non-monetary, in-kind contributions, i.e. property or a commodity, but not a currency, a similar position taken by the U.S. Federal Elections Commission (FEC) and the Canada Revenue Agency.\nHowever, Elections Canada has left the question of whether to classify cryptocurrencies as monetary or non-monetary open for the parties to consider in the current consultation process.\nIs Bitcoin Legal in Canada?\nChetan Phull, a Toronto lawyer, founder and principal of Smartblock Law Professional Corporation, has written about the seemingly murky area of the legality of using cryptocurrencies as money in Canada.\nPhull told Bitcoin Magazine that the use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as money (legal tender) is, strictly speaking, illegal under Canada\u2019s Currency Act.\nHowever, he acknowledges that \u201cCanada may be opening up to treating crypto as a type of non-fiat money, despite the current statutory definition of money.\u201d\nHe points out that, to date, \u201cthere has been no actual enforcement action against the use of crypto as \u2018money\u2019 in Canada \u2014 not even against the Calgary Digital Dollar, where enforcement would be supported by long-standing precedent of the Supreme Court of Canada. Nor has there been any significant government pursuit of taxes not charged on trades of crypto as a good.\u201d\nAlthough Elections Canada has agreed that cryptocurrencies are not money, its inquiry into crypto contributions further suggests that Canada\u2019s general climate is warming toward the use of crypto as a type of non-fiat money.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not quite there yet given the present law on the books,\u201d Phull stated, \u201cbut these are all signals that Canada is opening up to crypto becoming a medium exchange in commerce. The appropriate crypto-friendly legislation will follow, starting with virtual currency regulations which are presently in draft.\u201d\nPhull also noted that the trend in the U.S. to bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream, recently with a bipartisan bill before Congress for the Token Taxonomy Act, could carry some weight in Canada.\nAt the state level, Ohio now accepts payment of business taxes in crypto via ohiocrypto.com, three crypto-centric bills are presently in committee in New York, and a recent bill from Wyoming is attempting to clarify cryptocurrencies as money within the state.\n\u201cAs more U.S. states permit the treatment of cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange, cryptocurrency in Canada will continue to move into the mainstream,\u201d says Phull.\n\u201cCryptocurrency will ultimately be legalized as a form of payment in Canada, one way or another. It\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d\nCarter Cameron-Huff, a Toronto CPA who also works as a volunteer chief financial officer for political riding associations, told Bitcoin Magazine that accepting another form of donation will require streamlined rules to meet the reporting requirements of both EC and the political party.\n\u201cThe big challenge is that campaigns and riding associations need to be audited by a CPA; finding a CPA who is confident auditing things of a digital currency nature can be a challenge as they are typically risk averse.\u201d\nPolitical parties are responsible for ensuring that no single donor exceeds the annual limit and that complete identification is received with each donation.\nManaging Cryptocurrencies as Political Donations\nAn official with Elections Canada told Bitcoin Magazine that their top priority is to ensure full transparency in any political donations over $20 CAD, as outlined in the Canada Elections Act.\nThis means that, to have a donation accepted, the political party must establish that the donor is a Canadian citizen and must confirm the identity of anyone who donates more than $20 worth of cryptocurrencies to a campaign.\nContributions of $20 CAD or less can be anonymous but EC cautions parties to \u201cwatch for unusual amounts or patterns in anonymous contributions they receive.\u201d\nIn addition, each party would be required to keep a running tally of crypto donations (in equivalent fiat) to ensure that no single donor goes over the current annual donation limit of $2,700 CAD.\nEC is recommending that the contribution amount is the commercial value of the cryptocurrency at the time that it was received, based on the rate on a major exchange platform.\nBitcoin Donations Not Treated Equally\nUnlike a fiat contribution, donations in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies would not be eligible for a tax credit.\nThis is a problem for Cameron-Huff who sees this as a basic unfairness in the new EC proposal. He is planning to contribute his views as part of the Elections Canada consultations.\nIn the U.S., a 2014 FEC ruling that said political campaigns and organizations could accept bitcoin donations led BitPay to partner with CoinVox and a number of fundraising agencies to help process the donations.\nJared Polis, current Governor of Colorado, and Mick Mulvaney, current White House Chief of Staff, were among the first U.S. legislators to accept bitcoin campaign donations.\nNOTE: Bitcoin Magazine reached out to the four federal political parties for comments on the Elections Canada decision. At press time, only the Green Party responded, saying that they do not accept cryptocurrency donations at present.", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 23}

The Series B funding round was raised from SBI Crypto Investment, a subsidiary of Japanese financial giant SBI Holdings.\nBRD will use the funds to scale its operations into the Asian market.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very gratifying to see such a significant financial institution as SBI validating BRD\u2019s technology and business model through a strategic investment during an otherwise difficult time for the industry, and we believe it\u2019s precisely these attributes about BRD which set us apart and position us for significant growth this year and beyond,\u201d said Adam Traidman, CEO and co-founder of BRD.\n\"We started BRD in 2015, shortly after Bitcoin had its first run up and then biggest crash to date. Not an easy time to start a new company, but we raised our seed round successfully while other companies were struggling to survive. And here now in 2019, with crypto markets once again in their worst downturn to date, we\u2019ve completed our Series B.\u201d\nExpansion Into Asia\nTraidman said Asian users currently use debit and credit cards to make payments on the platform. BRD's expansion into the region means that cheaper payment options like local bank transfers would be enabled soon.\n\"The net result is more convenience, lower fees and overall better user experience for new and existing crypto investors. Further, we are engaged in new business models with large financial institutions in Japan and beyond, to leverage BRD\u2019s platform for B2B and B2B2C products and services,\" Traidman explained.\nBRD also inked a deal with European cryptocurrency payment provider Coinify, a move that would allow EU residents to make bitcoin purchases in a low-cost medium using SEPA transfers on the app.\nSpencer Chen, BRD's VP of global marketing, told Bitcoin Magazine that the new payment option marks a first for EU residents on the platform.\nBitcoin Funding\nBRD hasn't always secured capital in fiat currencies. About one-third of BRD's seed funding was raised in bitcoin, back when BTC was trading around $250. Their Series A was a combination of crypto and fiat. Traidman said the company still holds most of their tokens as part of their corporate treasury.\n\"We routinely rebalance our fiat and crypto holdings to adhere to our treasury policy which is designed to balance corporate cash flow needs with the ability to take advantage of long term crypto market trends. As you can imagine, we are long on crypto overall.\"\nWhile last year remains a year to forget for most cryptocurrency companies, it isn\u2019t so for BRD. The startup seems to have had a milestone year, per its release. It claims to have recorded a 116 percent year-over-year growth on the total installed base for its mobile app, with a total of 1.8 million installations globally.\nWhat's more surprising is its Q4 results, with the startup claiming to have signed up 400,000 new users during the period.\nWhile BRD didn't release how many transactions were initiated during the same period, the startup seems to have generated quite a number of interests during crypto's darkest hour.\nBeyond the positive metrics, Chen believes the downturn in the market gave BRD insight into their audience.\n\"It affected our business most with the shift that we saw regarding where the source demand for crypto was originating from. In 2017, we experienced a huge influx of consumers buying bitcoin and crypto for the first time. In 2018, it started shifting to more trading of existing crypto assets, which is more indicative of usage of established crypto enthusiasts and long-time holders. It was crucial that we continue to 'read the room' if you will, especially around consumers new to crypto.\"\n", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 25}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin users may, before long, be able to benefit from a trick called \u201cTaproot.\u201d First proposed by Bitcoin Core contributor and former Blockstream CTO Gregory Maxwell, Taproot would expand on Bitcoin\u2019s smart contract flexibility, while offering more privacy in doing so. Even the most complex smart contracts would, on the blockchain, typically be indistinguishable from regular transactions.\nWhile a big undertaking, this is not just theory. Several of the most prolific Bitcoin Core contributors \u2014 including Pieter Wuille, Anthony Towns, Johnson Lau, Jonas Nick, Andrew Poelstra, Tim Ruffing, Rusty Russell and, indeed, Gregory Maxwell \u2014 are working on a Schnorr signature proposal that would include Taproot, all in one protocol upgrade.\nHere\u2019s what Taproot is and how it works.\nP2SH\nAll bitcoins are essentially \u201clocked up\u201d in scripts: a couple lines of code embedded in a transaction included in the blockchain, that define how the coins can be spent in the next transaction. Spending conditions usually involve providing a signature to prove ownership of the coins. But other, well-known conditions for example include timelocks (coins can only be spent after a specific block height or date) or multisig (coins can only be spent if some number of private keys out of a set of private keys provide signatures).\nDifferent conditions can be mixed and matched, to create complex types of smart contracts. An example of such a contract could be that coins can be spent if both Alice and Bob sign, or if Alice alone signs after a week has passed, or if Bob alone signs while also providing a secret number. Whichever of these three conditions is met first, is how the coins are spent.\nSince 2012, scripts (the conditions) are often not publicly visible at first; only the new owner of the coins knows how they can be spent. This is done with a trick called P2SH (pay to script hash), where initially only a hash of the script is included in the blockchain. This seemingly randomly scrambled number holds the coins. When the owner spends the coins, he reveals the whole script as well as the \u201csolution\u201d to the script at the same time. Anyone can then use the initial hash to check that the supplied script was indeed the original script locking up the coins and can immediately conclude that the requirements of the script were met.\nStill, when the coins are spent, it\u2019s currently necessary to reveal all the possible conditions that could have been met \u2014 including the conditions that weren\u2019t met. This has two main downsides. One, it\u2019s data heavy, especially if there are many conditions. And two, it\u2019s bad for privacy. Everyone learns all the different ways in which funds could have been spent, which can, for example, reveal what kind of wallet was used and perhaps even more.\nMAST\nMAST (Merkelized Abstract Syntax Tree) is a proposed solution that uses Merkle trees (a decades-old, compact data structure invented by cryptographer Ralph Merkle) to work around these two downsides. In short, all the different conditions under which the funds can be spent are individually hashed (as opposed to combined into a single hash) and included in a Merkle tree, which ultimately produces a single hash: the Merkle root. This Merkle root \u201clocks up\u201d the coins.\nThe unique benefit is that if any of the data in the Merkle tree is revealed, the Merkle root and some additional data (called the Merkle path) can be used to verify that that specific data was included in the Merkle tree. The rest of the Merkle tree remains hashed and hidden.\nWith MAST, this means that only the condition that is met needs to be revealed. If, in the initial example above, Alice alone spends the funds after a week, she just reveals that condition (and the Merkle path). No one learns that the money could have also been spent by Alice and Bob together, or by Bob alone if he\u2019d added a secret number. This makes MAST more data efficient than complex P2SH smart contracts and adds privacy to boot.\nYet with Schnorr, Taproot can do even better: a transaction can hide that a MAST-structure existed at all.\nSchnorr\nThe Schnorr signature scheme has long been on the wishlist of many Bitcoin developers and is currently in development to be deployed as a soft fork protocol upgrade. Many cryptographers consider the Schnorr signature scheme to be the best in the field, as its mathematical properties offer a strong level of correctness, it doesn\u2019t suffer from malleability and is relatively fast to verify.\nAs its best-known benefit in the context of Bitcoin, Schnorr\u2019s \u201clinear math\u201d allows for signature aggregation: several signatures in the same transaction can be combined into one. A similar trick could be applied to multisig transactions. Combining both public keys and signatures into \u201cthreshold public keys\u201d and \u201cthreshold signatures,\u201d a multisig transaction can be made indistinguishable from any regular transaction.\nAnd the signature scheme can be used in even more interesting ways. For example, it\u2019s possible to use data to \u201ctweak\u201d both a private key and a public key. As a simplified example, a private key and its corresponding public key could be tweaked by multiplying both by two. The \u201cprivate key x 2\u201d and the \u201cpublic key x 2\u201d would still correspond, and the \u201cprivate key x 2\u201d could still sign messages that could be verified with the \u201cpublic key x 2.\u201d Anyone unaware that the original key pair was tweaked wouldn\u2019t even see any difference; the tweaked keys look like any other key pair.\nThis is what enables Taproot.\nTaproot\nTaproot is based on an interesting realization: no matter how complex, almost any MAST-construction could (or should) include a condition that allows all participants to agree on the outcome and simply sign off on a settlement transaction together. In the earlier example, if Bob knows Alice can, by herself, claim all the funds next week, he might as well cooperate with her now to sign off together. (In many typical smart contract setups he would even be penalized if he doesn\u2019t. The complexity really just serves to keep everyone honest.)\nTaproot resembles MAST and always includes a condition where all participants can cooperate to spend the funds: the \u201ccooperative close.\u201d\nBy utilizing Schnorr signatures, this is where it gets interesting.\nFirst off, the cooperative close would utilize Schnorr\u2019s threshold trick to make it look like a regular transaction, from one person to another. So, the public keys of all participants are added together, resulting in the \u201cthreshold public key.\u201d Corresponding with this threshold public key, the combination of all participants\u2019 signatures \u2014 their \u201cthreshold signature\u201d \u2014 allows them to spend the funds.\nSo far so good, but spending the funds as if it were a normal transaction is the only thing they can do \u2014 no MAST-like structures yet. That\u2019s where the other Schnorr trick comes in.\nAll the alternative ways in which the funds can be spent \u2014 the non-cooperative outcomes \u2014 are this time combined into a different script. This script, then, is hashed and used to tweak the threshold public key. Rather than \u201cpublic key x 2,\u201d as used in the example earlier, this results in a \u201cthreshold public key x script.\u201d (We\u2019re still simplifying.) This \u201cthreshold public key x script\u201d corresponds, of course, to a \u201cthreshold signature x script.\u201d\nNow, if the money is spent cooperatively, all participants combine their signatures into the \u201cthreshold signature\u201d and tweak it with the script. The resulting \u201cthreshold signature x script\u201d allows them to spend the funds. Yet, and importantly, to the outside world, all this would still just look like a regular public key and a regular signature \u2014 a regular transaction.\nOnly if a cooperative close proves impossible, the threshold public key can be shown for what it really is: tweaked.\nIn this case, both the original threshold public key and the script are revealed. This proves that the \u201cthreshold public key x script\u201d was tweaked with this specific script. So, like the hash in P2SH, the tweak proves to the world that the funds should be spendable if the alternative conditions, as specified in this script, are met. (And, like with P2SH, these conditions are of course immediately met to spend the funds.)\nAlternatively, instead of tweaking the threshold public key with script, the threshold public key can be tweaked with a Merkle root of a Merkle tree that includes all the different conditions under which the funds can be spent: a MAST structure. To spend the funds, then, only the spending condition that\u2019s been met needs to be revealed.\nAs such, Taproot offers all the benefits of MAST, while under normal circumstances no one will ever know that a regular transaction was hiding such a complex smart contract as a fallback.\nThis is a general outline of the Taproot concept; implementation specifics may vary.

{"title": "Neutrino: A Privacy-Preserving Light Wallet Protocol", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/neutrino-privacy-preserving-light-wallet-protocol/", "birthday": "Jan 3, 2019 1:06 PM EST", "date": "2019-01-03 18:06:00", "content": "Lightning is all the rage these days and, while it's an exciting development, users currently have to have a full node running in order to transact in it. In this article, I'm going to introduce Neutrino, a new protocol for light clients to get the data that they need while preserving privacy and without trusting a central server.\nA Little History\nIn the original white paper written in 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto described something called Simplified Payment Verification (SPV). SPV is how a light node can verify payments without downloading, verifying or storing the entire blockchain. This was supposed to be the basis of light wallets. Unfortunately, the original Bitcoin Core software did not implement Simplified Payment Verification, so light clients did not have access to the data necessary to do SPV in a privacy-preserving way.\nIn 2013, BIP0037 was added to Bitcoin Core to make SPV viable. BIP0037 created network commands to make the Simplified Payment Verification possible for light nodes to do. Light nodes could now ask for proof that a particular transaction happened in a particular block. That way, light nodes wouldn't have to trust servers but could actually verify the data being given to them.\nTo achieve this, the light client gives the server a filter. The server then runs the filter over all the transactions of a new block and reports back those transactions, along with proof that they're in the block, to the client. The client then verifies the proof and looks at the transactions to see if any of them belong to the wallet.\nUnfortunately, BIP0037 has a few drawbacks. Among others, it was seen as being difficult to implement and most light wallets have opted to use something else. The Electrum wallet, for example, uses its own proprietary protocol which isn't privacy-preserving. The Mycelium wallet calls servers that the Mycelium company runs. In addition, there are denial-of-service vectors (by having to run lots of filters) to exploit servers that respond to BIP0037 requests.\nFurthermore, the privacy aspects of BIP0037 turned out to not be as strong as was thought. It turns out the server can know a lot about the light wallet (like what balance it might have, whom its transacting with, possibly even what it's buying) by looking for certain kinds of patterns.\nAs a result, BIP0037 has largely fallen into disuse, despite being in the Core software since 2013.\nWhat Is Neutrino?\nNeutrino is a protocol to verify payments, except this time, the bulk of the work is done on the client side. Instead of the server filtering transactions for the client, now all the transactions belonging to a block (technically ScriptPubKeys corresponding to each input and output except the OP_RETURN outputs) are compressed and sent to the client. It's now the client's job to figure out if any of the transactions are ones it has transacted in. If any of the transactions are relevant to the wallet, the client then requests the full block to verify the transactions.\nIt turns out that the compression can be pretty impressive. A normal block is around 1.4MB, but by compressing it (technically, hashing each ScriptPubKey to 64 bits), each block produces about 20KB of super-compressed data per block. Since this super-compressed block is the same for every light client, this removes the denial-of-service vulnerability for the server. This also means that the server gets no special information about the light client other than what blocks it wants to look at, meaning that there are much fewer privacy leaks.\nTrade-offs\nOf course, by adding privacy, we do have some trade-offs to consider. First, there's more data being sent back and forth. While 1.4MB to 20KB is a pretty large reduction in bandwidth, BIP0037 allowed an even bigger reduction as servers only transmitted about 3KB of data for blocks where there were transactions the wallet participated in and only 80 bytes for blocks without such transactions. Assuming about one transaction per day, that's about 100 bytes per block overall for BIP0037, which means Neutrino is more expensive from a bandwidth standpoint.\nFurther, there is more validation to do on the client side as the client now has to do additional verification to prove that the data sent by the server is true.\nPrivacy is preserved while looking for transactions that the wallet has participated in. Usually, these are transactions where the wallet is receiving money. For sending money, however, Neutrino doesn't really help and there are a lot of privacy concerns there still (though Tor and Dandelion can help).\nLastly, there is likely going to have to be a new commitment to the coinbase transaction of each block to facilitate Neutrino, which would require a soft fork.\nWhat This Means for You\nIt turns out that Neutrino is not just useful for Bitcoin wallets, it's also useful for Lightning. Setting up a Lightning node is currently difficult, in part because you have to run a full node which takes a long time to sync. Neutrino is available in btcd, but not in Bitcoin Core yet, so until it\u2019s available in Bitcoin Core, light wallets are going to have a tough time finding nodes to get data from. It is for this reason that Wasabi has had to make their own servers with similar super-compressed block data.\nOnce Neutrino arrives to Bitcoin Core, Lightning Wallets will be able to run as a light client much more easily. And that means that your bitcoin wallet will be far more effective in preserving privacy. This does not mean that you\u2019ll have complete anonymity, especially from chain analysis, but you will be able to achieve a large portion of the privacy that full nodes currently enjoy without storing, transmitting or verifying the entire blockchain.\nPrivacy leaks are ultimately security leaks as information about you can be used against you.\nTransacting with wallets which use the Neutrino protocol means that your bitcoin transactions, whether on-chain or on the Lightning Network, will be a little less susceptible to leaking information.\nMore Information\nFor developers interested in this technology, BIP0157 and BIP0158 spell out the protocol in detail and test vectors are available from the developers at Lightning Labs. For consumers, ask if your wallet provider is planning on implementing Neutrino.\nConclusion\nNeutrino is a technology that is long overdue. Most people using light node software have to trust external parties to some degree, which is not the cypherpunk ideal. By using Neutrino, wallet developers will now be able to create wallets that are truly self-contained and do not require trusting a server.\nJimmy Song is a Bitcoin developer, educator and entrepreneur. \nCheck out his 2-day seminar: https://programmingblockchain.com and upcoming book: https://amzn.to/2F2DzIj \nFollow Jimmy @jimmysong on Twitter, Medium and GitHub.", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 3}

To believe in Bitcoin at that time, you had to be a rebel, someone who thought critically about what could be. A true believer.\nThat all changed in early 2013.\nWhen I went to my first Bitcoin meetup in San Francisco in January 2013, it was a very modest space, carved out of the newly refurbished 20Mission. Some of the inhabitants, including the owner Jered Kenna, created a video halfway through the demolition which shows its initial state. Since 2011, Bitcoin meetups had only been hosted by himself and his company, Tradehill.\nAt that time, there were very few people who were interested enough in Bitcoin to show up in person to the meetup. To put this in perspective, on January 31, 2013, 32 people RVSP\u2019ed to come and only about a dozen showed up.\n\n\n\n\nThis was finally a place where like-minded individuals could connect and bounce ideas off of each other. We could share the faith together. The early attendees started some of the most successful companies and funds in the space.\nJed McCaleb - Mt.Gox, Ripple, Stellar Founder\nJesse Powell - Kraken CEO\nCharlie Lee - Litecoin Creator\nJered Kenna - Tradehill CEO (first U.S. Bitcoin exchange)\nBrian Armstrong - Coinbase co-founder\nFred Erhsam - Coinbase co-founder\nOlaf Carlson Wee - Polychain Founder\nBryan Vu - Lightning Labs\nRyan Singer - Chia co-Founder\nIn May 2013, after the price spiked from $10 to $260 (the first 2013 \u201cbubble\u201d), there was a new wave of interested people which drew the attention of mainstream journalists. The meetup in April was even called the \u201c$100 party\u201d with a 100+ RSVPs. I distinctly remember one VC, David Chen from Lightspeed, handing out business cards. It was in that moment that I realized Bitcoin wasn\u2019t just a hobby anymore \u2014 it was going mainstream!\n\n\n\n\nA journalist, Kashmir Hill, well-known from her articles with Forbes, made her name in the space by living on bitcoin for a week. At the end of the week, she had received so many tips in bitcoin that she invited the community out for a sushi dinner. Forbes brought a film crew out and, when it came time to pay the bill, I was able to demo my product ZeroBlock, which was the only real-time market data mobile product at the time. In addition to real-time market data, ZeroBlock had the first aggregated news feed. Since the space was so new (Bitcoin Magazine was still a print publication), we would scrape r/bitcoin\u2019s \u201chot\u201d RSS feed. Ryan Selkis had started his \u201cTwo Bit Idiot\u201d blog around this time, and he reached out to me to ask if I could add it to the feed.\nAlso in May, there was the San Jose Bitcoin conference, which was the biggest Bitcoin conference that had ever been held. The Winklevoss twins were the headliners at the conference. To the best of my knowledge, they were the first \u201cmainstream popular\u201d people to associate themselves with Bitcoin. And to put things in perspective, Roger Ver\u2019s tweet about the conference only had three retweets.\nEarly 2013 distinctly marked the birth of the Bitcoin industry and mainstream adoption. The early members of the San Francisco Bitcoin community built many key companies and propagated the message of Bitcoin among the tech community. The San Francisco Bitcoin community helped the Bitcoin seed grow and mature into a mighty organism.\n\nThis is a guest post by Dan Held.

Calling its new wallet \u201cLedger\u2019s new signature product,\u201d the team indicated in a demonstration and interview with Bitcoin Magazine that the Nano X stays true to the simple design of its flagship, the Nano S, with some added complexity and versatility.\nMost notably, the Nano X is being released in tandem with the new Ledger Live Mobile app, available for both Android and iOS. Connecting to the hardware wallet via Bluetooth, this application will allow users to check their wallet status and balance, send transactions and install/uninstall wallet support for various coins without having to unlock their hardware wallet.\n\u201cThere have been a lot of requests from our users to have a native application,\u201d Ledger\u2019s CEO \u00c9ric Larchev\u00eaque told Bitcoin Magazine. Until this app, which will also allow Nano S users to check their wallet status in \u201cread-only mode,\u201d Ledger customers had to rely on browser extensions like Chrome or MetaMask or services like MyEtherWallet to manage funds.\nOther improvements over the Nano S include a larger screen, the migration of the buttons from the top to the front of the device for easier navigation and the ability to hold a charge (the old Nano S must be plugged into a computer or outlet to function). According to Larchev\u00eaque, the new design also addresses \u201cone of the biggest complaints from [Ledger\u2019s] customers\u201d: lack of memory.\n\u201c[For the Nano S], depending on the app, you can have from five to ten to fifteen wallets, but if you have a lot of crypto, you need to install and reinstall these to manage coins \u2014 it\u2019s a lot of work. Now, with the Nano X, you have much more memory and you can have up to 100 applications at one time,\u201d Larchev\u00eaque said.\nHe continued to stress that, in addition to improvements to memory and UX, the mobility that the Nano X\u2019s Ledger Live app would give to the hardware wallet is its most distinguished feature.\nWhen questioned as to whether the Bluetooth feature would expose any security vulnerabilities, Larchev\u00eaque reinforced that the Nano X\u2019s security design is as robust as its predecessor.\n\u201cThe Bluetooth connection is only used to send public data, such as your public key. The transaction itself is encrypted end-to-end while using the highest level of encryption and security on the Bluetooth protocol \u2026 no private keys are on the Bluetooth connection. It\u2019s the same as the USB cable. Security-wise, the architecture is the same.\u201d\nLedger aims to build on the Nano S\u2019s success, which has sold more than 1.5 million units since its inception, and they\u2019re already off to a good start. In addition to launching at CES, the Nano X will also be awarded the CES Innovation Award in Cyber Security and Personal Privacy for 2019.\nLarchev\u00eaque believes this award is not only indicative of his company\u2019s success but also of the strides the crypto space has made from a fringe hobby to a mainstay in the tech industry.\n\u201cI think it says a lot about the recognition of the industry of a new category. The fact that this prize has been awarded to hardware wallets shows that it\u2019s now a category. It\u2019s not a toy or a hobby. It shows the legitimacy of what we\u2019re doing. It\u2019s a recognition that cryptocurrency is a new category of consumer electronics.\u201d\nA week or so after Ledger shared the news with Bitcoin Magazine, Wallet.fail demonstrated a vulnerability in the Ledger Nano S, Ledger Blue and Trezor One at the Chaos Communications Conference (35C3) in Leipzig, Germany. Wallet.fail chose to forego responsible disclosure practices and demonstrated the vulnerability before alerting the hardware wallet companies, though Ledger and Trezor have both since addressed the issues and are working on patches.\nThe Ledger Live Mobile App will be available January 28, 2019, and the Nano X will be available for preorder on January 7, 2019, and will ship in March.", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 7}
{"title": "Ten Years Later, a Reflection on Bitcoin\u2019s Genesis and Satoshi\u2019s Timing", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/ten-years-later-reflection-bitcoins-genesis-and-satoshis-timing/", "birthday": "Jan 2, 2019  11:07 PM EST", "date": "2019-01-03 04:07:00", "content": "Colin is an associate editor and staff writer for Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0 He's proud to call Nashville his home, where he lives with his family and doesn't eat hot chicken as much as you might think.\u00a0\n\nOctober 31, 2008, and January 3, 2009.\nThe two dates have cemented themselves with Promethean significance into Bitcoin\u2019s lore. On October 31, Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin white paper, a constitution of sorts for his revolutionary monetary system and its intrinsic currency.\nOn January 3, this constitution came alive with Bitcoin Block #0. Also known as the network\u2019s genesis block, this cornerstone would provide the foundation for an ecosystem that would challenge our perception of how money is valued and managed in a digital age.\nTen years later, we celebrate the birth of the Bitcoin network much like we might a nation. If the white paper is a declaration of monetary independence, then the genesis block is our independence day and the founding of a new system. By bootstrapping the network, Satoshi broke ground on a completely novel form of money: decentralized, algorithmically based and completely peer-to-peer digital cash for a digital age.\nFor what the genesis block actually is, there\u2019s little to tell. The first block on the network, it includes a single transaction: the 50 BTC block reward sent to Satoshi for mining it (which, along with his other mining rewards, he still hasn\u2019t touched). It has all the trimmings of a regular block; besides being the first, there\u2019s little distinguishing it from the rest, save the unique data it houses.\nWith the January 3 Launch, Satoshi\u2019s Intentions Are Clear\nRather than focus on what the genesis block is, today is a day to reflect on what the genesis block represents.\nThe genesis block, by all rights, is emblematic of monetary sovereignty. It\u2019s the digital embodiment of Satoshi\u2019s monetary philosophy, a rejection of the centralized policies of the fiat system in favor of the decentralized processes of a cryptographically secured and mathematically verifiable digital system. Satoshi believed the old mode was failing, so he built a new one without all of the controls and hazards that can lead to the debasement of fiat currencies with reckless printing practices.\nHis intent is covertly coded into the genesis block, though the meaning of this message is clear. Embedded in the hexadecimal code on the genesis block\u2019s coinbase, the message, after being decoded, reads as follows: \u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\u201d\nThe message is a direct allusion to the headline for The Times the day Bitcoin launched. As the article details, Alistair Darling, the U.K.\u2019s Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time, was debating a second bailout for U.K. banks. This capital infusion would come nearly a year after the government flushed the same banks in an attempt to ballast credit flow and stanch impending economic downturn, something the United States did for its own banks in October of 2008.\nThe rest is obviously history.\n2009 would begin with the climactic unraveling of the global economy. Fractional reserve lending, bad debt and a mortgage crisis would send the world\u2019s economic dominoes toppling after each other in the worst international crisis since the Great Depression some 80 years earlier.\nThat the genesis block was founded on the same day as news of an imminent bank bailout is certainly symbolic. Satoshi\u2019s early writings show that he was well versed in central banking monetary policy and the alleged hazards of a fiat-based economy. He saw the central banking practices that led to the 2008\u20132009 financial crisis, the conjoined nature of federal governments and national/private banks, as a hazard for both client trust and currency valuation.\n\u201cThe root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that\u2019s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts,\u201d he writes in a February 2009 forum post.\nThis post came a little over a month after Satoshi bootstrapped the network, but he discussed implications of his creation in relation to modern banking practices before the Bitcoin blockchain went live.\nOn the day he released the white paper, Satoshi sent his work to the Cryptography Mailing List. His work was feverishly engaged by a handful of recipients, including then Google engineer and later Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn.\nIn the thread, interspersed between constructive criticism of Bitcoin\u2019s potential design flaws, recipients compare notes and observations on legacy banking practices. Of course, they also philosophize on how Bitcoin fits into the larger picture, with one commenter, James A. Donald, positing that decentralized issuance could protect the economy from overbearing governments \u2014 though he also cautions that the power and influence of these governments should not be dismissed.\n\u201cIf a small number of entities are issuing new coins, this is more resistant to state attack [than] with a single issuer, but the government regularly attacks financial networks, with the financial collapse ensuing from the most recent attack still under way [sic] as I write this.\n\u201c... in the late nineteenth century political attacks on financial networks began, as for example the Federal reserve act of 1913, the goal always being to wind up the network into a single too big to fail entity, and they have been getting progressively bigger, more serious, and more disastrous, as with the most recent one.\u201d\n\u201cToo big to fail\u201d became a popular mantra of governments when justifying their decisions to bail out big banks during the credit crisis. The system warranted resuscitation solely because it is monolithic in scale and too intertwined in the socioeconomic political arena to let falter.\nA Reminder of Why We\u2019re Here\nThere\u2019s an argument to be made that government interventionism, along with the artificial lowering of interest rates and quantitative easing that the Federal Reserve effected to \u201crevive\u201d the economy, made the crisis worse (Satoshi likely would). And as the longest bull market in U.S. history since the Great Depression is supposedly reaching its end, some analysts have argued that the catalyst for another looming crisis has taken root with the same practices that spurred on the 2008\u20132009 crash.\nAgain, that Bitcoin\u2019s launch coincides with the worst global financial crisis since the Great Depression is no accident. The currency and its network were born out of the Great Recession and represent the monetary antithesis of the questionable banking practices that incited the crisis.\nBanks were bailed out on behalf of the governments with which they share a symbiotic relationship. These banks and their bookkeepers were insured with taxpayer money and protected because they are \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d Meanwhile, the average citizen languished in an anemic economic climate with no windfall.\nThe symbolic genesis of Satoshi\u2019s new economic system, as well as the hidden message that testifies to his vision, seem to say: \u201cFor the rest of us, for the 99 percent, here is our way out \u2014 here is our bailout.\u201d\nSo as we celebrate Bitcoin\u2019s 10-year anniversary and the founding of the genesis block, let\u2019s not forget the intent behind Block #0. It\u2019s not just the first block on the network. It\u2019s the beginning of an entirely new monetary system divorced from the central controls and malfeasance of our current system. It\u2019s Satoshi offering us an alternative. It\u2019s the solution to a problem introduced when fiat currencies ousted the gold standard.\nIt\u2019s revolutionary, it\u2019s for the people and it\u2019s the key to our economic freedom.\nPrice is nice, but let\u2019s not forget why we\u2019re here.\nHappy 10th anniversary!\n", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 3}

There are some bullish and bearish setups on the horizon for bitcoin, so let\u2019s check out both sides of the argument because currently the market is sitting in the middle of Indecisionville \u2014 the most immediate sign of which is this glaringly obvious head-and-shoulders bottom reversal pattern:\n\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Head-and-Shoulders Bottom\nThis current pattern is nothing more than a setup at the moment, but it represents one potential outcome of this sustained consolidation. In order for this pattern to be confirmed, we need to see a daily candle close above the neckline (horizontal blue line). A breakout of this reversal pattern has a measured move of approximately $1,000 \u2014 a target of around $5,200. However, there are plenty of things that should keep the bulls wary for the time being. Until we close a higher high, the trend remains down.\nAnother potential outcome for a swing high is a bull trap called a Swing Failure Pattern (SFP). Quite simply put, an SFP is an impulsive move to new highs that fails to close above the previous high:\n\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Potential SFP Setup\nIf the market moves above the previous high shown in the figure above, but fails to close above it, we could see an immediate rejection of the high; this could trigger a powerful reversal.\nThe whole point of an SFP is to engineer liquidity for big players. So, when the price breaks to a new high, it lures in plenty of breakout traders who are impatient. Once the price fails to close above the previous high, those traders are now trapped in underwater long positions that will then be used to push the price lower as they get stopped out or liquidated.\nHowever, as previously stated, both of these possibilities are up in the air. At the moment, we are currently suspended in the middle of a trading range which is generally considered to be a no-trade zone, as it is fraught with bull and bear traps. Contrary to the two previous scenarios I\u2019ve laid out, it\u2019s entirely possible that we even visit the bottom of the range to retest support. We currently only have one real test of that support and we could potentially revisit the support in the low $3,000s.\nUntil bitcoin makes a test of the upper or lower boundaries, there isn\u2019t a whole lot we can do in terms of macro trend analysis. It\u2019s at times like this that it is often advisable to prepare for a move and lay out a plan for both the bullish and the bearish scenarios \u2014 sort of like an if/then format: If bitcoin moves above resistance and closes, then I will do \u201cx,\u201d and if bitcoin moves above resistance but fails to close above the high, then I will do \u201cy.\u201d For now, we will have to wait and see how the market treats its next test of macro support or resistance.\nSummary:\nBitcoin has been range-bound for almost 2 months and has yet to retest its established lows or established highs.Although it is currently in the middle of the range, there are a couple potential scenarios I outlined in this article. A massive inverted head-and-shoulders setup could push the price to the low $5,200s. However, a failure to close above the previous high could see a strong reversal of the trend to the downside of the range.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

This compensation will be done with the project's token called BSQ.\nHow Bisq Works\nBisq is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange platform that allows users to trade bitcoins in exchange for fiat currencies and other crypto assets. Bisq operates on a global P2P network, allowing traders to transact with one another without the need for a third-party or monitoring authority. The project was developed as a means of providing traders in the crypto market with a private, secure and censorship-free means of exchanging cryptocurrencies, using bitcoin as a base for exchange with national currencies and other crypto assets.\nAs Bisq is an open-source software, you can download, install and configure it to your liking; this involves adding your payment method. Configuring Bisq is expected to be fast as it doesn't require know-your-customer (KYC) documentation, which is one of its selling points. Once the application is up and running, you can look through the offer book for existing offers to trade bitcoin.\nEscrow\nTo keep funds secure for both the buyer and seller, Bisq implemented an escrow, which is basically where security deposits and trading funds from the traders are held in a 2-of-3 multi-signature escrow. Traders hold custody of a key each, while an arbitrator holds the third key. Bisq uses a decentralized human arbitration system to resolve trade disputes. Arbitrators are anonymous users, who are trusted due to the large bonds deposited into the network and they are randomly assigned to dispute cases by the protocol.\nBisq DAO and the BSQ\nHaving decentralized the resources that run Bisq, the developers want to use its DAO \u2014 which is now live on testnet \u2014 to decentralize how it's managed. The DAO, which will determine the strategy, management and operations of the project, uses the BSQ token to reward contributors maintaining it.\nThe tokens are layered on top of Bitcoin's blockchain as colored coins, a concept that shows that a small portion of bitcoin represents another value other than bitcoin. When its rolled out on mainnet, users will be able to utilize BSQ to pay for Bisq trading fees, vote on future contributions to the project and get compensation for contributions.\nOver 25 bitcoins have been donated to the project since it launched in 2014; these were used to create 2.5 million BSQ tokens. The first BSQ batch will be distributed to the first set of contributors who have worked on the project over the years, according to the project's documentation. By doing this, the project is placing a portion of the software's future in the hands of those who have brought it this far.\n\u201cBSQ tokens are used to vote on and make decisions about the Bisq DAO itself, and by initially distributing BSQ to past contributors, we intentionally establish the Bisq DAO as a meritocracy in which those who have contributed the most value to the project in the past are those who have the most say over its future.\u201d\nNew BSQ tokens will be issued every time a contributor submits a compensation request for BSQ. Those tokens will then be destroyed when they are spent to offset trading fees by users. So, while earning BSQ through compensation increases its supply, spending them as trading fees, decreases their total supply. Users can also exchange their BTC for BSQ on the Bisq platform.\nThe project's contributors will release the DAO on mainnet along with the project's v1.0 release in 2019.", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 7}

Delphi Digital gave us an early peek at the report before announcing it on social media January 10.\nThis report isn\u2019t your typical, shot-in-the-dark price signal from an old bull, Twitter trader or crypto entrepreneur. They didn\u2019t use the usual magic tricks of technical analysis or rehash arguments of fundamental value. They\u2019re making their call by referencing unspent transaction output data (UTXO).\nMethods and Findings\nThe report, titled \u201cBitcoin Holder Analysis Through Cycles,\u201d builds on analysis Delphi Digital conducted for an earlier report entitled \u201cThe State of Bitcoin.\u201d Namely, it creates a price forecast by viewing selling pressure through the lens of UTXO.\nLooking at UTXO data, Delphi Digital was able to pinpoint accumulation and selling patterns based on when unspent bitcoin either lay dormant or was moved to be sold. In its report, the firm claims that there \u201chave been consistent trends in UTXO age distribution and how that distribution relates to time and price.\u201d\nDelphi Digital\u2019s report comes with a handy graph to illustrate these trends. Positioned under a bitcoin price chart, the firm tracked the percentage of unspent bitcoins in \u2264 3 month, 3\u20136 month, 6\u201312 month, 1+ year, 1\u20132 year, 2\u20133 year, 3\u20135 year and 5+ periods in a series of charts. They cover every major boom and bust in their analysis, with data dating back to the beginning of the network (though there wasn\u2019t much going on in the first year).\n\n\nIn short, the analysis finds a substantial correlation between a rise in the total number of coins that haven\u2019t been touched in 1+ year(s) and a drop in the number of 1+ year UTXO as prices fall.\nThis isn\u2019t too surprising. As the long-term holders and early adopters of each cycle see a rapid appreciation of their investment, they dump. And, as the report points out, this dumping creates a generation of bag holders on the other end of the transaction. New money comes at the crest of a cycle, investors buy the top and those late to the party are left with overpriced party favors.\nThe bulk of the report looks at the time bands to diagnose the most recent market cycle. Breaking down its 1+ year band into 1\u20132 year, 2\u20133 year, 3\u20135 year and 5+ periods, the firm\u2019s data indicates that the UTXO for the 1+ year time band found a floor midway into 2018 and has reversed to an upward trend. Delphi Digital concluded that this likely indicates that long-term holding (3\u20135+) selling pressure is close to exhausted, and thus projects that the market will hit a bottom some time in Q1 of 2019.\nTime bands can only change if a) coins are spent and these coins then regress to the \u2264 3 month band or b) if coins remain unspent and graduate to an older band. Given this logic, Delphi used the 5+ year UTXO as a variable to gauge selling pressure from coins in the 3\u20135 year band, since most of the coins in the 5+ band are lost (Chainanalysis finds that some 2.78\u20133.79 million could be lost, roughly 1 million of which are probably Satoshi\u2019s).\nWhile the 5+ year band has remained static during 2018\u2019s bear, the chart shows a clear reduction in the 3\u20135 year band and a rise in the 1+ year band, meaning that 2\u20135 year coins are being spent, not graduating to the 5+ range.\n\u201cWe can safely assume the primary source of selling came from coin owners who\u2019ve been holding for 3\u20135 years,\u201d Delphi Digital hypothesizes in the report.\n\u201cWithin the analysis, we are able to establish that selling pressure from long-term holders is significantly tapped, and accumulation has begun. Using the timing of previous price bottoms relative to different bitcoin accumulation points, we can use current UTXO dynamics to forecast a rough date for a price bottom,\u201d the firm said in correspondence with Bitcoin Magazine.\nForecast\nDelphi Digital\u2019s findings will likely bring some relief to hodlers who have weathered the 2018 bear market.\nIt also offers an optimistic glimpse at what the trajectory of the next cycle might be.\nUsing some brain-bending statistical gymnastics, the firm \u201ccompared the amplitude of the 6\u201312m line to see what portion it made up of the 1+ year bottom to top amplitude\u201d (i.e., looking at the percentage (amplitude) of the 6\u201312 month band compared to the lowest and highest point in the 1+ year band for a cycle).\n\n\nSizing up the 6\u201312 month band and the 1+ year band for this cycle against previous ones, the Delphi Digital projects that the next cycle\u2019s peak will come around April 17, 2020.\nNow don\u2019t go take out a second mortgage on your house/car/vintage doll collection. Delphi Digital admits that its data is limited, but it also believes in the consistency of its data (that the peak of market cycles correspond with the a roughly 63\u201368 percent peak in the 1+ year UTXO time band). Still, the firm cautions that it is \u201cdifficult to be confident in a forecast for a date this far out.\u201d\n\u201cThe purpose of this analysis is to provide insight on bitcoin holder patterns to improve our educated guess on the timing of the price bottom. As we say within the report, we don\u2019t believe this analysis should function as an indicator on its own \u2014 but rather it should be used in combination with other relevant data to make the most informed decision possible,\u201d Delphi Digital told Bitcoin Magazine.\nPlenty of industry advancements and events could disrupt the projected cycle, Delphi Digital continued to explain. Most notably, it expects the maturation of the Lightning Network and general adoption to tame volatility. Moreover, it also anticipates that the next halvening (~May 2020) will also dampen selling pressure.\nDelphi Digital will continue to release reports such as this one throughout the year.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

For Bitcoin, this is a big step forward in allowing interoperability between other blockchains and itself in a trustless manner.\nAtomic swaps are not an entirely new feature, as Bitcoin Magazine has reported on a Lightning Network ERC-20 swap with bitcoin just a few months ago.\nAccording to Qtum\u2019s blog post, the main solution that makes atomic cross-chain swaps possible is Hash Time-Locked Contracts, or HTLC. In a brief summary, HTLC essentially locks up the funds in a transaction for enough time so that both blockchains are able to confirm the transfer of funds on their own (via block confirmations) and gives both parties time to claim their funds. If enough time passes where one side has not claimed their funds, everything is returned back to the original parties.\nThe entire process of the atomic swap is described in the blog post as follows:\nAlice initiates a transaction on Qtum which contains a time-locked contract and transfers QTUM to Bob.Bob audits the transaction.If the transaction is approved, Bob participates in a similar transaction on Bitcoin which pays BTC to Alice.Alice audits the transaction.If the transaction is approved, Alice redeems BTC from it.Bob extracts a secret from the redeeming transaction.Bob redeems QTUM from the initial transaction.If the time specified in the time lock is reached and Bob has not redeemed the token, Alice can refund the token.\nIn the last year, Qtum has made significant leaps forward in developing its blockchain for greater adoption and interoperability as well. Atomic swaps are just the next step.They are also a crucial, next-step feature for interoperability with the Lightning Network.\nWhy Are Atomic Swaps Important?\nAtomic swaps solve a big problem in cryptocurrency, which is the inability to directly exchange two different types of currencies with each other without having to rely on a trusted third party like an exchange or company.\nIn a present example, let\u2019s say Alice wants to buy a digital collectible from Bob, and there is no way to trade in person. If Alice wants to send money to Bob for a collectible, Bob could easily receive the funds and not send the collectible in return. Also, the opposite could happen, where Bob sends the collectible first and Alice never sends the money in exchange.\nThe problem in the present example is the factor of trust. When trust is factored into the risk of exchanging things online, it becomes much more risky. Atomic swaps are a solution to this problem, as described above, because they allow funds to be exchanged between parties without having to rely on anything but mathematics to ensure the process has been completed smoothly.", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 9}

Thor will connect to Bitrefill's node on the Lightning Network, allowing users to receive Lightning payments whether they have bitcoin loaded into their Lightning wallets or not.\n\"This service will let the customer get an empty lightning channel opened to them from Bitrefill\u2019s node, on the Lightning Network. Now anyone can now pay for, or gift, the ability to have a channel opened to a Lightning wallet in order to receive payments over Lightning at any time,\" according to a company announcement.\nThe Lightning Network is a protocol built on Bitcoin that allows for instant and cheap payments between users, without compromising the security and decentralization of the cryptocurrency. With Lightning payments, you can make multiple payments at a small fraction of the cost of a regular bitcoin transaction, as you don't have to settle each transaction on the blockchain. Transactions are only settled when the channel is closed.\nHowever, in order to receive Lightning payments, users must have a payment channel open with at least one other Lightning user that has funds on their end of the channel. Without that, there is no way to have funds routed to you. And while it\u2019s possible that a payer opens a brand new Lightning channel to a payee when making the initial Lightning payment, this does require time (a blockchain confirmation) and money (on-chain fees), thus diminishing the advantage of Lightning in that instance.\nWith Thor, users can purchase an empty channel (potentially also for their friends or business partners) with crypto. Users don\u2019t need to put up any money in the payment channel themselves, while Bitrefill maintains the channel, funded on their end for 30 days. As such, you can immediately start accepting payments through Bitrefill\u2019s channel to you.\nThe channel opening service from Bitrefill currently works with command-line client LND wallet and the Bitcoin Lightning Wallet for Android. Payments for Thor can be made with custom capacities of 300,000 satoshis to 16,000,000 satoshis using Bitcoin, Lightning payments and a number of other payment options. an empty lightning channel with custom capacities of 300,000 satoshis to 16,000,000 satoshis, and payments for the service can be made through a number of options including bitcoin, Lightning payments and existing Coinbase balances.\nThe Lightning Network has continued to grow since its first implementation was announced in March 2018 by Lightning Labs.\nAs of November 2018, the network was supported about 4,070 nodes, with a collective capacity of 223.65 BTC. At press time, the Lightning Network supports 5,241 nodes with a collective network capacity of 563.17 BTC.", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 11}

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for that. It\u2019s not meant to be used like cash,\u201d Jeremy Gardner, founder of Ausum Ventures, advised me.\n\u201cSatoshi created a decentralized store of value,\u201d probably encapsulates his thesis that bitcoin is best unspent \u2014 better to hoard it like gold. To Gardner, using it as a currency is not only impractical. It is counterintuitive.\nWell, I\u2019m trying it anyway.\nAfter all, journalist Kashmir Hill experimented with living on bitcoin as early as 2013, so it should be easier now, right? Well, it is and it isn\u2019t. Nearly six years later, I\u2019m discovering that, while bitcoin\u2019s payment infrastructure has advanced, its use as a method of payment, at least in San Francisco, has seemingly regressed.\n\n\nBefore reporting to the conference I\u2019m attending here in San Francisco, I had something important to do: I had to pay my respects to the pioneer.\nBefore leaving my home in Nashville to start my experiment, I reached out to Kashmir Hill, a former Forbes-gone-Gizmodo journalist who did this in 2013 (and again in 2014). She graciously took me up on my request to meet up so I could pick her brain and seek advice.\nGetting to her was my first unbanked transaction. Transportation was a problem in her own experience until she got a bike, and even then, San Francisco\u2019s hilly landscape is unforgiving, so it still wasn\u2019t easy. It\u2019s a way to get around, though, and I like the idea of being bike reliant for transport.\nAll of my attempts to buy or rent one on Craigslist haven\u2019t come to anything yet, so that\u2019ll have to wait.\nI do have Paxful to buy Uber gift cards. Opting for this, I signed up for the exchange (where I had to give a phone number for authentication but no name) and transferred $25 worth of bitcoin from my BRD wallet. After executing a quick trade with one \u201cMarxsmith,\u201d I found myself with 25 bucks worth of Uber credit on my account.\nHill arrived at La Boulangerie shortly after my Uber dropped me off, immediately recognizable, thanks to the turquoise highlights that accentuated the tips of her hair.\nWhen I thanked Hill for agreeing to meet with me, she replied she was naturally sympathetic to anyone who made the decision to live solely on bitcoin for a week. So sympathetic, she offered to pay my meal forward (the bakery doesn't accept bitcoin). I insisted on repaying her for the cheese danish and latte, but she said that she'd need to see if she remembered her Coinbase login to give me her public address.\n\"I wrote the articles and pretty much forgot about bitcoin,\" she joked.\nIt was during the first major media cycle that came along with the 2013 bubble that Hill experimented with living on bitcoin. Not many people knew what bitcoin was yet. A few mainstream journalists were starting to pump out articles about what was, to many, a novel experience in itself: buying bitcoin.\nHill's editor wanted to take the novelty farther: \u201cDon't just buy bitcoin. Live on it for a week.\u201d So she did.\n\"It was really on the fly \u2014 I got pretty lucky,\" she laughed, calling the planning and execution \"lackadaisical.\"\nIf her approach was lax, the execution was anything but. She attended one of San Francisco's famous \u201cBitcoin at $100\u201d meetups, she shacked up in the crack-house-turned-hacker-hostel/cypher community, 20Mission, and she even toured Coinbase when it was \u201cthree guys in an apartment,\" she put it.\nAs she mentioned this, a waiter brought our lattes. They were absurdly served in literal bowls about as big as my face.\nAt the end of it, she remarked that she had very much been assimilated into this community. Using the bitcoin that the community had tipped her throughout the week, she took about 50 or so of them out to a sushi dinner, an 8-something BTC meal that, in a few years, would have been worth an Ivy League education.\n\n\nWhen I lived on Bitcoin in 2013, I treated a bunch of strangers to a sushi dinner that cost 10 bitcoin. At current valuation, that was a $99,000 sushi dinner!\u2014 Kashmir Hill (@kashhill) November 28, 2017\n\n\nThe crypto community in 2013 was devout but scant, and so were the places Hill could spend bitcoin. Her entire experience was punctuated by a sense of getting by. This is best encapsulated by the final line of her 2013 series: \u201cI survived.\u201d\nI compared notes with her about what I foresaw as being my biggest obstacles for the week, making mental notes to see if I could do more than \u201csurvive\u201d and if 2013 might have actually been an easier year for the experiment.\nAs our conversation came to a close, Hill left me with a nugget of advice that I\u2019d adopted as a mantra for my own iteration of the experiment.\n\u201cDon\u2019t make the focus about yourself. Make it about other people, who the experiment allows you to access.\u201d\n\n\n\nLeaving La Boulangerie, I took an Uber back to the conference venue, where I made arrangements with Jeremy Gardner to visit a new project he\u2019s working on and, of course, tour the infamous Crypto Castle.\nWe had a tight time frame; he was leaving for Park City, Utah, that night to go snowboarding.\n\u201cYou can come by the castle tonight. Or later in the week, someone will let you in, show you around \u2014 I don\u2019t care.\u201d\nWe eventually settle on a 4:00 p.m. meeting outside of Monarch, a popular club wedged between San Francisco\u2019s Mid Market and Tenderloin districts that accepts bitcoin by-the-bottle. It\u2019s within walking distance of the conference which is good because my Uber credit was running low and the conference didn\u2019t have any Wi-Fi for me to get on Paxful/Bitrefill to top it off.\nThe rest of the early afternoon was spent prepping for and moderating a panel, after which I scrambled around, looking for a USB-C charger to juice my phone and keep my financial lifeline alive (I had lost my charger that morning, of course). The conference tech staff was nice enough to lend me a charger, one of many acts of good will that seems to continually grace my experience.\nWhen the time rolls around, Jeremy meets me with one of his business partners, Micah, who owns Monarch and another bitcoin accepting club in San Francisco, Great Northern. We hop one building over to their new project: a pawn shop that serves as the front for a speakeasy, both of which will accept bitcoin.\nThe shop had been a pawn for a while, Gardner said, buying, trading, selling and even offering loans and collateral for years before it shut down.\n\u201cAll the snakey stuff,\u201d he intimated.\nJeremy latched onto the speakeasy idea without much hesitation. He was disappointed that San Francisco only has two to its name and thought that the city ought to share with the rest of America in an emerging cultural trend (even Nashville has four or five).\n\u201cIt\u2019s more intimate and comfortable. It\u2019s not the constant in-and-out traffic like at bars, so people stay longer.\u201d\nThe pawn shop, with its display cases of cheap jewelry, tarnished silver and surprisingly intact china, is just a front, of course, but it adds an authentic element of secrecy to the bar. Jeremy wants to give the front its own distinguishing appeal. He wants it to only accept bitcoin.\n\u201cI\u2019m imploring people to do that,\u201d he said, breaking into a smile.\nMicah scurried around, jotting notes and measurements before coming over to me and Jeremy and pouring us a glass of white wine (I\u2019m not refined enough to know which type).\n\u201cSorry, it\u2019s just white,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s alcohol, and that\u2019s all that matters,\u201d Jeremy replied.\nMicah ran off to keep working, leaving Jeremy and me to a conversation on my experiment.\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s an interesting one. People have done it before,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for that. It\u2019s not meant to be used like cash but as a store of value. People don\u2019t like volatility. They want certainty in their currency.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t understand why I would spend my bitcoin and not hold on to it, and I told him I don\u2019t see it as spending bitcoin but spending money I would otherwise have to on basic necessities. Jeremy said he\u2019d be interested in a wallet that rebought spent bitcoin, but otherwise, he clings to the maxim that it\u2019s better to hold than spend.\n\u201cThe point,\u201d he believes, \u201cis to make people think about bitcoin \u2014 not spend it.\u201d\n\n\nWe carried the conversation into an Uber on the way to the castle.\nI asked Jeremy whether he considered himself a Bitcoin minimalist (he had made the somewhat common comparison between Bitcoin and Friendster earlier in our talk).\n\u201cNah, I\u2019d say I\u2019m more of a shitcoin minimalist.\u201d\nFinally, we arrived at the castle. It lived up to its reputation. The outside was as unassuming as any of the nicer, multi-story boarding houses in the city\u2019s Potrero Hill neighborhood, but the inside belied the true spirit of the castle: an eclectic, anything-goes hub of itinerant millennials who live under the benevolent auspice of a prodigal 27-year-old member of the crypto riche.\n\u201cWe had a self driving AI car startup here.\u201d Jeremy gestured to the basement as we entered. \u201cThey got a couple mill in funding and moved out,\u201d he added casually.\nUp the staircase, the second floor hallways curled away from the stairwell with innumerable ownerless rooms.\n\u201cVitalik has slept in this room a bunch of times,\u201d Jeremy told me as he\u2019s no doubt told countless before me.\n\u201cBut this is where the magic happens,\u201d he said as he came to the third floor. Up top, there's a lounging area with felt couches, a gas fireplace and a kitchen with a sticker-covered refrigerator that intrigued Business Insider and the New York Times when they profiled the place during the 2017 bullrun. The walls are hung with various print pieces, including a few of Banksy\u2019s. I nearly asked, as a joke, if they were originals but held my tongue.\nJeremy had left to pack his things when Liz, a young realtor boarding at the house, joined me and Rachel, another border. Neither of them were particularly involved in crypto.\n\u201cSome of us don\u2019t do anything with it, but others do,\u201d she tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s a healthy mix.\u201d\nWe get on the topic of the experiment, and I bring up Jeremy's latest venture. Rachel, who is seemingly Jeremy\u2019s romantic interest, apparently had no idea and congratulated him when he returned to say goodbye.\n\u201cOh yeah, it\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d he enthuses. He leans in to give Rachel a peck on the cheek.\n\u201cWhen will you be back?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he admits. \u201cProbably one to two months.\u201d\nLater, I asked Rachel if Jeremy meant what he said as he rushed off to catch an Uber to the airport.\n\u201cAbsolutely. He means everything he says.\u201d\n\n\n\nLiz, aka the Queen of the Castle, has given me permission to stay a few days, and I think I\u2019ll take her up on it later in the week. For the remainder of my initial visit, though, I charged my phone (still struggling here) and used Bitrefill to get more Uber credit. This was much quicker and easier than Paxful. The most KYC they ask is an email, and you can send the bitcoin from any wallet to retrieve the gift card code (Paxful requires you to deposit bitcoin into your account's wallet to trade).\nI spent the remainder of the night with my buddy and coworker Christian, who bought me dinner at the Irish Bank, a pub which I erroneously thought accepted bitcoin (I did pay him back in bitcoin). The goodwill of friends and fellow crypto geeks has been essential and I anticipate it will continue to be so throughout the week.\nThe rest of the night was a blur of exhaustion as we finished dinner and headed back to Christian\u2019s apartment. I had been up since 6:00 a.m. From coffee with Hill to the conference to Jeremy\u2019s speakeasy and Crypto Castle to pub to apartment, I had covered a lot of ground and met a great many people \u2014 some interactions and people I haven\u2019t had time to cover in this sprawling account, including a few Crypto Castle residents who were building a rig to mine grin.\nI got around, but I spent little bitcoin \u2014 unfortunately, none of it directly with any merchants. Hill covered my breakfast, though if she gives me a wallet address, I intend to reimburse her. The conference covered lunch. Bitcoin did buy me dinner, even if indirectly through Christian, and it did buy me Uber credit for transport \u2014 another indirect use, but as Christian pointed out to me, I was still supporting a use case and infrastructure.\nI crashed on the couch around 12:30 a.m. and was content to know that I would have access to coffee in the morning.\n\n\n\nThis is the first instalment of Colin Harper's Living on Bitcoin series. Continue reading his further adventures here.\nColin is an associate editor and staff writer for Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0 He's proud to call Nashville his home, where he lives with his family and doesn't eat hot chicken as much as you might think.\u00a0\n", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 15}

As president of Decentral Inc., he managed a staff of 30 and helped to take the company to 750,000 monthly wallet users.\nAs the first, all-crypto legal services firm in Canada, Cameron-Huff expects the ongoing uncertainty around Canada\u2019s cryptocurrency regulations to create some business for him, but he is also looking to build a global presence.\n\u201cIt\u2019s likely that the first legal work that I do in 2019 will be for a company from Malta or one from Singapore. I\u2019ve had client inquiries from as far away as Papua New Guinea,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\u201cThere is an ongoing global talent shortage, and lawyers are a part of that. Although most law is national/sub-national, there are certain corporate-commercial considerations that are cross-border, and legal strategy is international. Many businesses around the world can\u2019t find local legal talent that meets their needs, and this is an export opportunity for Canada\u2019s blockchain lawyers.\u201d\nCameron-Huff notes that Canada has a relatively welcoming regulatory and legal environment, especially when compared to the U.S.\nThe challenges continue to be \u201cnon-legal areas like commercial bank accounts (i.e. not being able to have access to the banking system), access to capital (especially post-angel), and competition for talent (crypto companies aren\u2019t the only ones trying to hire smart technologists),\u201d he said.\nDisappearing Federal Regulations\nAs noted here, the Canadian government\u2019s previously drafted regulations, which had been circulated for comment, have been quietly shelved at least until after the next election (expected in October this year), meaning that any enforcement date gets pushed back well into 2021.\nCameron-Huff, who was involved in the original, confidential regulatory consultation process in 2014, said the industry should be thankful that those efforts were never enacted. He told us he\u2019s not a fan of cryptocurrency-specific, even though he\u2019s heard from quite a few crypto businesses who are keen on regulation.\n\u201cWhat they don\u2019t understand is that the regulations won\u2019t be written by them or even for them. They assume that any regulations will be supportive of their vision for the industry and the Canadian payments space, but that\u2019s not necessarily the case, and even if it was, it has the potential to freeze existing models in place.\n\u201cThe major issue over the last two years has been how to avoid illegal securities. Exchanges have increased their scrutiny of new digital asset listings and the rest of the industry has followed suit. In 2019 will see a continued maturation of the space and an increased focus on regulatory/compliance. It can\u2019t be ignored anymore.\u201d\nCameron-Huff commended the federal government for its caution saying:\n\u201cThe current situation is one in which there is significant freedom to operate and experiment with new models. That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s needed right now.\u201d\nFuture of Crypto\nCameron-Huff is sanguine about tying his future to bitcoin:\n\u201cThe price goes up. The price goes down. The price goes up. That\u2019s the history of bitcoin in a nutshell. The only thing that would surprise me is if the price stays the same throughout 2019. I\u2019m dedicating myself full-time to this industry, so I think that shows my long-term view better than anything I could say. Developers aren\u2019t stopping and neither am I.\u201d\nAs far as working with the many altcoins out there, Cameron-Huff is not looking for any business and says of altcoins:\n\u201cThe vast majority of altcoins are inconsequential copies of the source code of major projects like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 copies that don\u2019t involve technological innovation will almost certainly continue to fail.\u201d\nHowever, Cameron-Huff expects to be advising some startups on token sales and he thinks that ICOs are likely here to stay, saying:\n\u201cI expect that 2019\u2019s token sales will be of higher quality than many of the ones from 2017/2018. There\u2019s a growing sophistication in the market and I think the \u2018gold rush\u2019 mentality has cooled.\u201d\nFixed Billing for Crypto Lawyers\nCameron-Huff said that he is happy to accept bitcoin as payment (as well as fiat) and, in what he sees as another pioneering step forward, he has a fixed-fee payment system for his clients.\nAs described on his website, a fixed-fee service is designed to ensure a firm has access to legal advice, no matter what the issue and when. Like a membership fee, it ensures access when needed.\nCameron-Huff sees this as more suitable billing model for the more complex needs of blockchain and cryptocurrency startups.\nStuart Hoegner, general counsel for Bitfinex, told us he sees a successful future for Cameron-Huff and commented about the fixed-fee system:\n\u201cI suspect he\u2019ll also find a very willing audience for the fixed-fee arrangements that he\u2019s proposing. Smart and forward-thinking lawyers have been open to these kinds of alternative billing arrangements for years, and they continue to be in demand.\n\u201cThey do not always fit a client\u2019s circumstances, but the key is modularity and choice. The attorney\u2019s way of working and billing should fit the client\u2019s business model and objectives, not the other way around.\u201d\nEvan Thomas, a Toronto-based lawyer who works with crypto businesses, is also enthusiastic about this new billing arrangement saying:\n\u201cWhat seems unique is that Addison is leveraging his particular legal and business expertise to offer a fixed price scope of work that goes beyond the typical legal work any startup needs and includes work and advice specific to companies in the blockchain/crypto space. An innovative model like that requires strong knowledge of the legal, business and technical issues specific to clients in the industry.\u201d\nCameron-Huff remains optimistic about wading into unchartered waters. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk online about crypto prices and whether or not 2018 was a bubble, but I\u2019ve only seen a steady increase in the number and quality of Toronto\u2019s blockchain companies. Canadian banks continue to hire blockchain developers. Startups have doubled-down on the value of their products rather than the value of their coins or tokens. I expect 2019 to be a big year for product development. The speculative side holds little interest for me.\u201d", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 11}

This swift move dropped the price nearly 10% in the span of just a few short hours:\n\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, Hourly Candles, 11% Drop\nNot only did this move occur on high spread, it occured on high volume. This level of supply and overall lack of demand is nothing something you would want to see if you are feeling bullish regarding bitcoin\u2019s market structure. Currently, we are sitting right on top of daily support levels and have yet to close a new low:\n\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Current Support Level\nWhile the volume and spread were pretty intimidating, it should be noted that the most immediate support level (shown above in blue) is currently holding. However, should this support level break, we should fully expect to revisit the support levels toward the bottom of the range in the low $3,000s. Until we see a daily close below the current support level, the trend model remains somewhat neutral. Although the market is swinging 10% in a day, the overall structure is neither bullish nor bearish.\nIt should be noted, however, that expansion of volume and price spread leading into support tests is often a sign of market distribution. A potentially bearish slant to the current downward impulse is present in the Bollinger Bands (BBands):\n\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, Daily Candles, Bollinger Band Squeeze and Expansion\nThe BBands have been squeezing inward for days, which indicates the market has been consolidating \u2014 no surprise there since the market hasn\u2019t really moved from its well-defined range. Looking at the daily BBands though, we do see the beginnings of a BBands expansion, indicating the market is done consolidating and is ready for its next major move.\nIn our case, the BBands are hinting toward a downward continuation. If we manage to break the blue support level shown above, we could potentially see a strong continuation of the macro downtrend.\nAs I stated before, I would like to see a close below the current support level before I go full-blown bear. Although the current market structure is neutral, it is starting to show the early signs of a strong bearish continuation. It\u2019s also important to note that we are still in a bear market. Just because bitcoin saw a couple of weeks of strong demand, that does not negate the months and months of downward pressure.\nSummary:\nBitcoin dropped 11% in one day as it finds itself testing its macro support level.We have yet to close a new low, but the BBands are showing the market is coiled and ready for its next major move.If we close below our current support level, the next logical test would be of the previous support level in the low $3,000s.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

It is getting attention and attracting participation in different ways, whether it is through speculation, investing and sending money, all the way to contributing to what\u2019s underneath the hood. The entire Bitcoin repository is on GitHub, inviting any developer to see the protocol\u2019s code and perhaps contribute toward solving existing problems if they can.\nA noteworthy fact, however, is that the pool of developers today is quite small.\n\u201cIt's not an easy field to get into,\u201d Jimmy Song, author of Programming Bitcoin and instructor at Programming Blockchain, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cInterestingly enough, the thing that makes Bitcoin hard to get started on is the cryptography, and that's hard because the math is not familiar to developers. Specifically, finite fields and elliptic curves.\u201d\nSome would argue, though, that the small number of developers in Bitcoin today is not too small. In fact, it\u2019s perfectly fine at the size it is for such a new industry.\n\u201cBitcoin has only been around for 10 years, and it only started getting a lot of mainstream attention in 2017, so it hasn't been a long time to build up an ecosystem of developers,\u201d said John Newbery, a Bitcoin Core developer and Bitcoin engineer at Chaincode Labs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that we hear a lot, that it is difficult to find experienced Bitcoin engineers \u2026 [Bitcoin] really only started getting mainstream attention two or three years ago, so it\u2019s as expected. We\u2019re doing everything we can at Chaincode to widen and deepen that pool.\u201d\nEven outside of developer knowledge, there are many aspects of various fields of expertise that require a significant level of understanding in order to grasp Bitcoin all around. Since there are so many paths that need to be explored, the question is: Where do you start?\nIt is important to be realistic and realize that a complete understanding of the digital currency will always be unreachable.\n\u201cI don't think it's possible to understand all aspects of Bitcoin,\u201d Newbery said. \u201cThe frontiers are continually being pushed forward so having 'proper education' that covers the entire Bitcoin space is a constantly moving target.\u201d\nPerhaps a better approach to answering this question requires going back to the very first Bitcoin educator himself, Satoshi Nakamoto. How did Nakamoto introduce something like Bitcoin for the very first time in his white paper so that as many people as possible could understand?\nNakamoto seems to have realized that the best way is to break down concepts separately, explain why they do or don\u2019t work individually, and then tie all the strings together at the end.\nA Few Examples in Action\nBUIDL Bootcamp\nOne such solution that presents a similar approach has presented itself in the form of Justin Moon\u2019s BUIDL Bootcamp, a grassroots effort by Moon that aims to educate \u201cHODLers\u201d about Bitcoin beyond the basics. Similar in structure to Bitcoin\u2019s white paper, Moon\u2019s four-project curriculum, starts with \u201cHow Bitcoin Works.\u201d The first BUIDL Bootcamp class is already halfway complete.\nSimilar to how the white paper first introduces transactions, then explains timestamp servers and proof-of-work systems before putting all the pieces together, Moon\u2019s curriculum takes a progressive, constructive approach.\nProject 1 starts with students making what\u2019s called a \u201cPNG coin.\u201d This is not a coin at all, instead it is a .png photograph of a paper signature with a message, like \u201cI, Alice, issue 10 coins to Bob,\u201d with a signature below it. Just as Satoshi Nakamoto introduces each of his concepts and proceeds to explain how alone they are subject to failure, Moon then shows his students how, with such a simple .png concept, it is easy to double spend transactions.\nEventually, the course introduces digital signatures to replace these image coins and introduces further concepts in a gradual fashion to teach similar lessons about why Bitcoin was built the way it was. All of this, is also only in project one out of four.\nOne of the most surprising things about the bootcamp is the extent to which people who had little programming experience were able to follow the course.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a few people that had no prior programming experience besides an introductory programming course, like Code Academy, and we\u2019ve had them get all the way through building an 800-line \u2018mini bitcoin\u2019 that has all the main features,\u201d said Moon.\n\nChaincode Labs\nThe efforts at Chaincode are working toward a similar goal of educating about Bitcoin. Also a bootcamp-style learning course, Chaincode accepts a select number of applicants to go through a multiple-week course about Bitcoin-related technologies. Their developer-focused initiatives educate about the entire Bitcoin system, with residencies covering topics from the actual protocol to second-layer technologies like Lightning.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done two versions of the residency focused on Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin, the protocol. And then we did the Lightning residency last year,\u201d said Newbery.\nAdam Jonas, who leads the education initiative at Chaincode, added, \u201cWe\u2019re also planning a little bit longer residency this summer, a three-month residency, which is much longer than anything Chaincode has run in the past. It is probably an opportunity to sort of fuse both the lecture series and onboarding efforts that we\u2019ve done, along with some project-based work. So hopefully getting the best of both worlds.\u201d", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 15}

The initiative, which launches today, January 16, 2019, is available in all 50 American states.\nEssentially, this partnership allows companies across the United States and Puerto Rico to fund their W2 payrolls and payroll taxes in ether and bitcoin. At the other end, employees can choose what percentage of their wages will be paid in bitcoin or paid in fiat currency.\nApart from payroll funding, the service also provides U.S.-based companies with the ability to fulfill HR and payroll compliance obligations for the employer to the U.S. government.\nAccording to Jonathan Chester, co-founder and CEO of Bitwage, companies that earn crypto often find it hard to pay W2 employees and taxes, as \"traditional payroll and payroll tax systems are designed for the fiat world.\"\nHe added: \u201cCompanies with banking issues using cryptocurrency could only hire employees as contractors, because paying taxes on behalf of W2 employees in fiat was impossible. This new product release changes this.\u201d\nWhile some companies hold lots of crypto assets, they lack the means of paying employees, freelancers, vendors or tax agencies with local currencies.\n\"We are enabling BTC or ETH to be a part of this. The BTC or ETH gets converted into fiat to be able to interact with these traditional systems. The worker can choose to receive a portion of their wage in BTC at the end as well,\" Chester explained.\nHe noted that Bitwage does not yet include the option for companies to pay out in ETH, just pay in. \u201cHowever, now companies such as ICOs and decentralized applications with a lot of ether can hire people as W2 employees/offer benefits and stay in compliance,\u201d he said.\nIn addition, these companies can fund their crypto holdings and make payments to local and foreign vendors, with adoption in countries such as India, Argentina, Britain, Brazil and others.\n\u201cWhile the partnership is for U.S.-based payroll, tax, hr, benefits, we can also pay fiat to freelancers and vendors internationally,\u201d said Chester.\nLive Beta Results\nBitwage has been running a beta version of this service for peer-to-peer crypto marketplace Paxful, as it seeks to improve crypto acceptance and fiat currency payouts.\n\u201cBitwage bridges the gap between Bitcoin and the traditional finance system,\u201d said Hayel Abbassi, a Paxful controller based out of their New York office. \u201cAs a company that earns 100 percent of revenue in bitcoin, we are always looking for service providers who will accept digital currency \u2026 Bitwage has recently formed a partnership with a traditional payroll company who integrates into their platform to provide these services.\u201d", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 16}

The document, which examines the sustainability of EU laws to cryptocurrencies, analyzed the use of digital assets within the EU, as well as some of the pan-EU laws that currently govern them.\nIn the report, the EBA decried the lack of uniformity in crypto laws. It stated that this lack of equilibrium means that companies can move operations to \u201ccrypto havens\u201d and face less-stringent regulations.\nEssentially, this could create an uneven competitive playing field. Certain countries such as Malta and Gibraltar have been known to enforce crypto-friendly rules. However, the EBA is looking to achieve a uniform regulatory environment in the zone.\nAdam Farkas, executive director of the EBA, said, \u201cThe EBA calls on the European Commission to assess whether regulatory action is needed to achieve a common EU approach to crypto assets.\u201d\nThe ESMA Discourages Crypto Legitimization\nOn the same day, the second regulator, the Europe Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) also published its advice to various EU-based banking institutions on ICOs and crypto assets.\nThe regulator pointed out that the crypto industry is quite small and presents little threat to traditional financial stability. However, it also expressed some concern over the risks posed to market integrity and the protection of investors.\nThe ESMA said, \u201cWider regulation of crypto-assets and related activities may have trade-offs, such as risking legitimizing crypto-assets and encouraging wider adoption.\u201d\nIn addition, the report recommended that cryptocurrencies shouldn\u2019t be legitimized, while also claiming that all digital assets should be subjected to anti-money laundering legislation.\nThe regulator warned about the significance of protecting the capital markets. Also, investors should be warned against buying crypto assets that aren\u2019t financial instruments, as excess regulation could bring them \u201cinto a similar regulatory remit as the one for crypto-assets that are financial instruments.\u201d\nGemini's Viral Ad\nThe sentiments of the two regulators seem to echo those of Gemini Inc., the crypto exchange owed by the Winklevoss twins.\nJust last week, the company engaged in a viral, city-wide advertising campaign. Buses, taxi tops and bus stops carried signs with messages such as \u201cCrypto Needs Rules\u201d and \u201cCrypto Without Chaos\u201d being boldly displayed.\nAt the time, Chris Roan, head of marketing at Gemini, said, \u201cWe believe that investors coming into cryptocurrency deserve the exact same protections as investors in more traditional markets, adhering to the same standards, practices, regulations and compliance protocols.\u201d\nAlso, while speaking about their ad campaign in an interview with Fortune, Tyler Winklevoss added, \u201cThe idea is that companies that build on top of things like Bitcoin should have a regulation that\u2019s thoughtful and that doesn\u2019t stifle innovation \u2026 People believe in the dream of crypto. They just don\u2019t know how to engage in it without getting burned. We\u2019re here to say Gemini\u2019s a place you can do that.\u201d\nThe Gemini ad campaign generated some to-be-expected reactions from the Bitcoin community, with many pointing out the folly in its approach to regulation.\nIn a tweet, Jesse Powell, CEO of Kraken, said, \u201cSaying crypto needs rules is like saying the poor need sanctions. Here's a rule: no more rules.\u201d\nNick Foley, a former support staffer at Coinbase, also stated that the rules required by crypto are already there \u2014 and based in mathematics. Foley took to Twitter to downplay the prospect of bringing complex regulations to the crypto space, calling most of these regulations unnecessary.\n\nRules like mathematics? Sure. Crypto needs that.

We obviously decided not to do that, but that was \u2014 in our view \u2014 the beginnings of the walled garden being built. The latest policy changes regarding SMS and Dialer permissions show a marked change of strategy for Google, bringing it closer in alignment with the Apple iOS Store than ever before.\u201d\nIf users opt to download the wallet directly from Samourai\u2019s Github, the team cautioned that they should \u201cverify the integrity of the APK they download by comparing the SHA-256 hash of their APK with the SHA-256 hash published on Github.\u201d\nAt time of publication, Google had not responded to Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s request for comment.", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 8}

Find out what happened to him on Day 1 here.\nI woke up on Christian\u2019s couch stiff-necked and cotton-mouthed. A bit more fitting for the \u201cliving on internet money\u201d survival vibe, yeah?\nA friend of a friend of Christian\u2019s roommates (who are starting a business and moving to LA today) was out cold on an air mattress next to a stripped Christmas tree, snoring into the streams of soon-after-sunrise light filtering through the window. Another blow-up mattress adjacent to the couch was vacant. Its former occupant, Julian Martinez, a copywriter at Quantstamp and Christian\u2019s friend, had left early in the morning, politely folding his sheets before he left.\nI trundled into the kitchen in search of coffee. Christian and his housemates grind their coffee and use a french press, which seemed rightly authentic for San Francisco. The Philz whole coffee beans were stashed in a cupboard along with some almond flour (also on point), spices and other ostensibly hipster culinary staples.\nChristian came in and we prepped the press. Sitting down for a cup in the dining area, the view from his apartment window seat offered up a gorgeous morning landscape of the residential area with the bay at its back.\nAs he and his girlfriend left to pick up breakfast, I was confronted with the task of condensing the whole of yesterday\u2019s events. In the flurry the day had become, I recorded the experience in scatterings between my phone, laptop and journal, typing or jotting whenever I had the time or inspiration struck. The words were distributed. It was just a matter of pulling them together and making them fit.\nSo most of Saturday was spent reconciling how to pare down the experience (2,900 words later, I didn\u2019t do a very good job). Christian and his girlfriend brought me back a croque madame from a local bakery and the San Franciscan sourdough lived up to its reputation. I wouldn\u2019t wrap up the first draft until probably 6:00 p.m. that night.\nOf course, there were interruptions (like eating) that involved my careful attention and purchase planning. I still hadn\u2019t done a point-of-sale (PoS) with bitcoin, and I thought I would have the opportunity at lunch with Curry Up Now.\nThe once-foodtruck, now-local chain has become a sensation with its uncanny Indian-Mex and world food fusion fare. Chicken tikka masala burritos, deconstructed samosas and aloo gobi tacos coexist with Indian street food, pub food with a curried twist and even fried ravioli with masala dip.\nAt one point in time, they accepted bitcoin, and most resources (like coinmap.org) indicated as much. But when I called to confirm, a hurried employee shot down my hopes.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry we don\u2019t,\u201d she said, a bit short and stressed, with the commotion of a popular restaurant audible in the background.\nHanging up, I hoped it wasn\u2019t an omen for the other restaurants I was planning to call.\nBummed as I was not to get to buy direct, the menu left me salivating so I ordered a tikka masala burrito with Uber Eats using my Bitrefill-bought Uber credit.\nAmazingly, when it arrived, I managed to lock myself out of Christian\u2019s apartment while he, his girlfriend and a future roommate went to lunch. At least I had food and rooftop access.\nI took the mishap as an excuse to take a break from writing and go enjoy the view on the roof. Up top, I tore into my burrito (which is a divinely inspired culinary design, I\u2019m convinced) and surveyed the vibrant view of a lazy Saturday.\nI wasn\u2019t too concerned by the lockening, mainly because I knew Christian and friends would be home shortly. Plus my phone had a healthy charge so I could get somewhere if I needed to, though my BRD wallet had been a glitchy cause for concern. But I wasn\u2019t going to starve while they were gone, so locking myself out was more of a dunce-cap moment than a shot in the foot.\nThey got home when I was halfway through with my burrito. Great when life works out like that (sucks when it doesn\u2019t though). Like the way transportation was panning out \u2014 and not just for me.\nRunning around in Ubers all week is going to beat up my wallet pretty good and already has. Christian offered to mitigate the problem by renting me his bike, so when he got back he took me to the house\u2019s garage to dig it out.\nWhen he opened the door, there was a pile of bikes chained together, none of which belonged to Christian\u2019s house. They belonged to his neighbors, but their bikes were gone. Earlier, Christian had been griping about his roommate Matt leaving the cover off the rooftop grill \u2014 looks like he might have forgotten to lock up the bikes (and the garage), too. I wasn\u2019t the only one with bike woes.\nSucks when it doesn\u2019t though.\nIf I can buy a bike with bitcoin while I\u2019m here, I intend to donate it to Christian\u2019s house \u2014 a gesture of good faith for letting me shack up.\nMaybe that will be my first IRL transaction in this tech city.\n\n\n\nI stayed in the rest of the day, in part to write but also because there wasn\u2019t much of a reason to go anywhere. If I needed food, I could order through Uber Eats. In fact I would have to, because day 2 was the day that I realized that most all of the places that used to accept bitcoin in 2013-14 no longer did. Almost all of the places I researched were either gone or had stopped taking crypto a while ago.\nHill tried to warn me, saying many of the places she visited were now out of business. The Cups & Cakes Bakery that garnered international media attention for being one of the first businesses to accept bitcoin, the sushi joint where she took the San Francisco bitcoin community out to dinner \u2014 both were gone. I\u2019ve searched for the Buyer\u2019s Best Friend grocery store, whose owner was inspired to take bitcoin after reading Hill\u2019s series, but, as far as I know, its physical locations have vanished. Google suggests that there\u2019s a delivery service that you can use, but the company\u2019s website just redirects me to a 404 page.\nI assured Hill that I had found other alternatives, some of which might have sprung up after her experiment. One by one, a series of disappointing phone calls discredited all of my research. All of the places that used to accept bitcoin no longer do. Some that I found on the resources I used (coinmap.org and finder.com) weren\u2019t even in business anymore.\nMy fear after calling Curry Up Now was being confirmed. Apparently, the restaurant\u2019s rejection of the cryptocurrency had been the unfortunate portent of a trend of restaurants that formerly accepted bitcoin but don\u2019t anymore.\nMy expectations had been completely thwarted. There are fewer storefronts and restaurants that accept bitcoin now than there were in 2013-14. So far, Uber credit has been keeping me afloat. I had yet to actually completely an in-person transaction for anything (except for when I paid Christian for dinner but that doesn\u2019t really count). The thought of it made me realize that I didn\u2019t even need to be in San Francisco to do the experiment. I could have been back home \u2014 I could have been anywhere.\nThat frustrated and fascinated me. So long as I had internet, I could buy gift cards from Bitrefill and Paxful and credit to eat/travel/sleep. I could buy just about anything a traveler would need: flights, hotel rooms, and gift cards for food and groceries. If I really needed to, I could even subsist on the cheapest, most ubiquitous fast food, like buying McDonald\u2019s gift cards to eat in the farthest corners of the world. There\u2019s Subway, too, and other chains you\u2019d find just about anywhere.\nThese services work even if you\u2019re unbanked, something that was touched on in a podcast episode I had with Christian that night for POV Crypto. Speaking to the experience so far, I mentioned the trend of restaurants either no longer accepting bitcoin or going out of business after accepting it (whatever that represents).\n\u201cSounds like you\u2019re having to use a lot of infrastructure to survive,\u201d he said in reference to how Bitrefill and Paxful have helped me out. \u201cWhich is still cool because even if you\u2019re unbanked, you can use bitcoin to live.\u201d\nAnd he\u2019s right about that. Even if I haven\u2019t (and maybe can\u2019t) pay merchants directly, bitcoin is still fulfilling its use case as a decentralized payment method. At once, it makes it difficult to survive on it in the physical world, but simultaneously, it makes it easy to survive online.\nIt\u2019s either too easy or too impossible.\nThe rest of the night was filled with dinner, paid for by one of our coworkers, John Riggins. When I asked Riggins for his wallet address, he didn\u2019t respond.\nAfter grub, we (Christian, his girlfriend Michelle, Riggins and I) all sat down for a game of Catan. A trading game involving resource cards that represent imaginary wheat, lumber, ore and cattle really gives you perspective when you try to live on internet money.\nIt made me think that, even in the worst case, maybe I could barter my way along. Or that, just like the shifting economics of the game, when certain resource cards would become more valuable depending on situation or player, it made me think: Someone will eventually come along who will take my bitcoin for food or a service or anything, right?\nI\u2019m going to get out and about to really see for sure the next day.\n\n\nColin's adventures continue...find out what happens on Day 3 here.\nAs Kashmir Hill did in her original journey, Colin is accepting BTC tips to help him along the way.\nFeel free to throw him a few sats here: 3CnLhqitCjUN4HPYf6Qa2MmvCpSoBiFfBN\n\nColin is an associate editor and staff writer for Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0 He's proud to call Nashville his home, where he lives with his family and doesn't eat hot chicken as much as you might think.\u00a0\n", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 16}

Building a strong Bitcoin community begins with individual efforts, some small, others more ambitious and labor intensive.\nWhat might you do to contribute to the Bitcoin ecosystem this year?\nTeach five people about bitcoin and help them set up a wallet.\nAnyone can become a Bitcoin evangelist. Chances are that there are a number of people in your family-and-friends circle who are BTC-curious but not sure where to start. Seek them out, answer some questions and help them to set up a wallet. There are plenty of easy (non-custodial) options to choose from, no matter where they are in the world. \nMake sure that they understand how to secure their wallets and their seeds and that they understand the power and responsibility that comes with having total control over their funds.\nThen send them a few satoshis to get them started. \nSet up a full node.\nHave you set up your own full node? Well, if you haven\u2019t, you should. \nNodes are essential to ensuring the security of Bitcoin. Running your own full node is also the only true way to validate your own bitcoin transactions without having to trust anyone else.\nSure, this might be a bit more of a labor-intensive resolution to actually fulfill, but it\u2019s worth it \u2014 not just for you but for the whole network.\nAccording to Bitcoin.org, here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need:\n\nDesktop or laptop hardware running recent versions of Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux200 gigabytes of free disk space, accessible at a minimum read/write speed of 100 MB/s2 gigabytes of memory (RAM)A broadband internet connection with upload speeds of at least 400 kilobits (50 kilobytes) per secondAn unmetered connection, a connection with high upload limits, or a connection you regularly monitor to ensure it doesn\u2019t exceed its upload limits. It\u2019s common for full nodes on high-speed connections to use 200 gigabytes upload or more a month. Download usage is around 20 gigabytes a month, plus around an additional 195 gigabytes the first time you start your node.Six hours a day that your full node can be left running. (You can do other things with your computer while running a full node.) More hours would be better, and best of all would be if you can run your node continuously.\n\nFor full details, check out bitcoin.org\u2019s page about running a full node or go to YouTube for lots of tutorial options.\nCreate a \u201cCrypto Will.\u201d\nAs the saying goes, \u201cYou can\u2019t take it with you.\u201d What plans do you have in place for your BTC after you die? How well-equipped are your heirs when it comes to them accessing your crypto holdings?\nAttorney/educator/evangelist/entrepreneur Pamela Morgan has spent a good part of 2018 advocating responsible crypto asset inheritance planning, as she describes in her book, Cryptoasset Inheritance Planning: A Simple Guide for Owners.\n\u201cI started asking annoying lawyer questions,\u201d Morgan said in an interview on The Tatiana Show. \u201cLike, \u2018If you have a bunch of cryptoassets, can your family access them?\u2019 If you have people who depend on you financially, if you want to have other people in your life, or charities or political causes you like to support, to be able to take advantage of your bitcoin or your other cryptoassets, you have to do something. If you do nothing, [it\u2019s] pretty sure that your assets will not go where you want them to go, if they end up anywhere at all.\u201d \nSo, consider making 2019 the year you put all your bitcoin affairs in order.\nGet control of your private keys.\n\u201cNot your keys, not your bitcoin.\u201d Do you have control of all your private keys? Do you even know where they all are? \nResolve to start the year off right by participating in this year\u2019s Proof of Keys celebration, to be held on January 3, 2019. Ideally, you\u2019ll also be running your own full node to validate that you own your keys as well, but even ensuring that none of your bitcoin is stored on a third-party, custodial server is a good start.\nGo back to Bitcoin\u2019s roots.\nHave you read Satoshi\u2019s white paper? Have you been to a local grassroots meetup lately? Sometimes, it\u2019s good to go back to basics and remember where we all started. The Bitcoin community has always been full of people who want to learn and share ideas (not just price predictions). \nPerhaps you began your Bitcoin journey at a local meetup many years ago or maybe you are just starting out now: either way, consider getting together with some other local bitcoiners. If you are an old hand, your experience is invaluable. If you are new to the community, you\u2019ll find others who can answer questions and show you the way. In any case, the Bitcoin community is made stronger when we work together and interact on a human level from time to time.\nThis year, find or reconnect with your local Bitcoin meetup group \u2014 or start one of your own!\nCheck out the Bitcoin Meetup Wiki or go to the Bitcoin page on Meetups.com where you\u2019ll discover 1,685,789 members and 5,586 potential meetups.\nChallenge yourself to learn or do something new or outside your comfort zone.\nAll of us have our areas of expertise \u2014 and areas where we are not so adept. What is one thing about Bitcoin that you\u2019ve always shied away from delving into? This doesn\u2019t need to be a \u201ctechnical\u201d challenge (though that is, perhaps, the most obvious sort of challenge to take up). Perhaps there is a book on economics that you\u2019ve put off reading? Or a conference presentation topic that you\u2019d normally pass over?\nMake this the year that you really expand your understanding of Bitcoin: read that book, attend that seminar, subscribe to that podcast or video series, build (or break) that thing.\nResolve to be a positive force.\nThis time last year, everyone was riding high with bitcoin and other altcoin prices up in the stratosphere. Since then, 2018 has been a long, devastating fall back down. \nExcept for all the cool stuff that actually happened along the way, and the general growth the network has experienced since last year.\nAlso, as many of us remember from previous years, the price of bitcoin has had plenty of ups and downs along the way.\nSo, as we embark on a new year, full of new possibilities and opportunities, resolve to be a positive force in the Bitcoin space: Avoid FUD, welcome newbies, welcome back altcoiners, don't gloat, keep hodling, keep buidling.\nPhoto by Julie Tupas on Unsplash", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 1}

A blockchain is made up of blocks that are secured every 10 minutes by computers called miners. For a detailed explanation of Bitcoin mining, see our guide on the subject.\nA block explorer is an interface for exploring blocks in a blockchain in a detailed way. Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s explorer, like others, provides updated information regarding every block in Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. Such information contains details including the total number of transactions in a block, as well as the individual outputs for each transaction.\nThe explorer also includes information about the block itself, such as how many blocks have been made before it (block height), the number of confirmations it has, a timestamp of when the block was accepted by the network, and size of the data inside.\nHow Can I Use a Block Explorer?\nBlock explorers are designed to be relatively user-friendly so that anyone can understand what information is being displayed. Using one is as simple as clicking through the most recent blocks and viewing the data inside it.\nBlock explorers are useful because they are a way for anyone to explore any part of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain at any given moment without having to manually search for a specific transaction. The search bar in a block explorer allows users to search for various data on the blockchain, including block height, hash, transaction ID and address.\nWhy Is a Block Explorer Important?\nBitcoin Magazine\u2019s block explorer is a great example of the value of open-source projects. Blockstream\u2019s release of Esplora shows that useful open-source projects provide value to a community. Block explorers are important to Bitcoin because they serve the function of allowing users to navigate through a complex field of information that is unreadable in its raw form. Similar to web browsers, there are myriad versions of block explorers that all serve the same function with different design interfaces.\nBitcoin Magazine\u2019s block explorer is one of many new website features rolled out in honor of Bitcoin\u2019s 10 year anniversary.\n", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 3}
{"title": "Why Ohio\u2019s State Treasurer Backs Decision to Accept BTC For Tax Payments", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/why-ohios-state-treasurer-backs-decision-accept-btc-tax-payments/", "birthday": "Jan 2, 2019  12:50 PM EST", "date": "2019-01-02 17:50:00", "content": "Andrew is an internet attorney, author, adjunct law professor, and media consultant for ABC, FOX, and NBC in Dayton, Ohio. He writes on social media crime, technology, privacy & digital currency.\nAs tax season is rapidly approaching, some states, like Ohio, have decided to set a new standard for the rest of the country to follow. Back in November, Ohio became the first state in the U.S. to announce that it would now be possible to pay taxes using bitcoin.\nWhile Ohio is first in actually implementing this for its business residents, it\u2019s certainly not the first one to try. Other U.S. states, like Illinois, Arizona, and Georgia have previously attempted to pass legislation allowing state taxes to be paid with cryptocurrency; however, such attempts have been rejected by state lawmakers or have not yet taken final form.\nState of Ohio Treasurer, Josh Mandel, told Bitcoin Magazine that he\u2019s been a crypto-enthusiast since 2014. Implementing his vision today, Ohio business owners are now able to register and resolve their tax disputes and/or liabilities online, with their payments processed by a designated cryptocurrency payment service provider.\nBitcoin Magazine spoke with Mandel about why Ohio\u2019s decision to embrace these new technologies is a step toward the state becoming a leader for the rest of the country. \nWhy Is This Good for Ohio?\nWith this announcement, Ohio has announced to the rest of the country that it is at the forefront of new technologies, specifically as it pertains to blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. By opening up its doors to entrepreneurs and businesses dabbling in these digital realms, Ohio hopes to welcome new types of ventures across its state lines.\n\u201cOur biggest motive here was to give taxpayers more options in paying their taxes,\u201d Mandel explained. \u201cSecondly, we wanted to project to the rest of the country that Ohio is embracing technology and is a place that is welcoming software developers and entrepreneurs who want to build a blockchain business here in the State of Ohio. By launching Ohiocrypto.com, we are planting the flag here in the state, and showing that we are a leader.\u201d\nMandel said that he and his office have been working on launching Ohiocrypto.com for a good portion of this year, emphasizing that this new system will yield many positive reverberations for years to come.\nYou Don\u2019t Have to Be a Computer Whiz or Crypto Expert to Participate\nThe good news is, you don\u2019t have to be a computer expert or a crypto expert in order to use Ohiocrypto.com.\nOne benefit, according to Mandel, \u201cwill obviously be providing business taxpayers with another option in which to settle their taxes, which is easy and intuitive for them to use.\u201d\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that this is only available to Ohio business owners \u2014 not individuals \u2014 to settle their private taxes.\nPhase One\nPhase I of Ohiocrypto.com, according to Mandel, allows Ohio businesses to pay 23 different business taxes in cryptocurrency, specifically with bitcoin. Here is a sample of the most commonly paid business taxes, which are part of the Ohiocrypto.com system:\n\nCigarette/Other Tobacco ProductsCommercial Activity Tax (CAT)Petroleum Activity (PAT)Public Utilities Tax (PUT)Sales Tax (ST)Withholding Tax (WHT)Interest on Lawyer\u2019s Trust Accounts (IOLTA)Motor Vehicle Fuel (MVFT)\n\nPhase Two\n\u201cIn Phase II, we hope to expand Ohiocrypto.com to include individual personal taxes, and also to expand beyond just bitcoin and include other cryptocurrencies as well. We thought the most intuitive and responsible way to begin this initiative, because it\u2019s the first time it\u2019s ever been done in America, is to start it off right \u2014 and that is by only allowing businesses to pay with bitcoin, and expand it out from there.\u201d\nA New, Inexpensive Way to Pay Your Taxes\nNot that any of us enjoy coughing up the green each year, but Mandel emphasized that one of the major benefits to the Ohio taxpayer is that, by using Ohiocrypto.com, the state is providing a cost-cutting mechanism when taxpayers go online.\n\u201cPrior to the launching of Ohiocrypto.com, the state allowed for taxpayers to pay their taxes in different ways \u2014 you could pay via check with no processing fee; you could pay via ACH with no processing fee; or you could pay via credit card with a 2.5 percent processing fee. But, the fee to pay via cryptocurrency, e.g. bitcoin, is only going to be 1 percent, which is less than paying via credit card.\u201d\nOhioCrypto.com\nMandel emphasized that Ohiocrypto.com is an initiative open to taxpayers of all different ages, stripes and geographic parts of the state. Once the taxpayer is successfully registered on the site and has entered their tax payment information, the amount of cryptocurrency in the compatible wallet that is used to pay the invoice is immediately converted from bitcoin to U.S. dollars and processed through BitPay.\n\u201cMost likely, I think we will see heavier use by smaller/medium size companies, privately owned, and probably some taxpayers in the younger demographic,\u201d the Ohio Treasurer added.\n\u201cBut, ultimately, as awareness builds, we will see widespread use \u2014 from a mom-and-pop diner to Fortune 500 companies. We are excited about the launch of this and we have a great partner in this initiative with BitPay.\u201d\nMandel told us that BitPay has been very responsive to its office, bending over backwards in order to ensure that the site is developed in a way that is extra safe and extra secure so that taxpayer money is protected at all costs.\n\u201cWe are thrilled to see Josh and State of Ohio taking this initiative,\u201d Stephen Pair, co-founder and CEO of BitPay, told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve done at BitPay over the years is to talk to companies in the blockchain industry help them work with their vendors to sign up and pay their bills with crypto. For example, an exchange has to pay vendors and suppliers. They would obviously prefer to pay their bills via crypto, which helps to grow the ecosystem and benefits their own exchange business. Similarly, all these businesses have to pay taxes as well and we are thrilled to help Ohio businesses pay their taxes this way.\u201d\nIt should be noted that at no point will the Ohio Treasurer\u2019s office hold cryptocurrency, mine it, or invest in it.\nOhio Is Looking to Host a Blockchain and Cryptocurrency-Friendly Environment\nThe state also hopes to benefit by branding itself as a place that is blockchain friendly, cryptocurrency friendly, and open for business when it comes to technology.\nAccording to Mandel, this first step has put Ohio on the map in becoming a leader in the blockchain technology and cryptocurrency space.\nMandel, in addition to selected representatives from the treasurer\u2019s office, recently attended the four-day Blockland Conference in Cleveland, where software developers, entrepreneurs and business leaders came together to learn how to inspire entrepreneurs and showcase the region as a potential hub for new technologies and a national leader in blockchain technology. \nThe lineup of speakers featured Beth Mooney, CEO at Cleveland-based KeyCorp; AT&T Communications CEO, John Donovan; Jerry Cuomo, an IBM vice president focused on the blockchain; Oracle Corp. CEO, Mark Hurd; and Wikipedia co-founder, Larry Sanger.\nWhat Challenges Lie Ahead?\nIt would seem that in a year filled with data breaches and security incidents with major players like Facebook, Equifax and other institutions, that this would seem all the riskier.\nBitcoin Magazine also spoke with Ari Lewis, cryptocurrency advisor to the State of Ohio Treasurer\u2019s office, on this matter.\n\u201cWe spent a lot of time and effort in extensively vetting payment processors,\u201d Lewis emphasized. \u201cWe were extremely confident in choosing BitPay because they were first in class in security and in guaranteeing taxpayer monies would be safe. So, for us, this was not a trial and error, and we see this as a program where we feel confident that taxpayer money is secure and all the transactions occurring are secured through the payment system.\u201d\nPhoto Credit: Josh Mandell / State of Ohio Treasurer\u2019s Office\n", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 2}
